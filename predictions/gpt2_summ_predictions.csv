I (24f) gave birth to my daughter six months ago and it should've been the happiest moment in my life. My husband Jim (26m), fake name, was furious and accused me of cheating and left right then and there. Jim refused to pick me up from the hospital, threw my stuff out on the lawn and changed the locks, so I had to stay with my parents. I was distraught and tried to focus on my baby. Eventually he agreed to do a paternity and he was 100% the father. Things that I thought he'd never say and he did it so easily. How are they going to treat our daughter when she does something that upsets them? I've never cheated and have been 100% innocent in all of this the whole.

I did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest AP classes available, etc. I’m really strongly just considering going to NYU with her. Then they went on to explain how I should go to NYU with my sister. My sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would I not go to Cornell, and they said how it was unfair that I basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. I knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that I don't deserve my spot sucks. I'm glad I have my sister actually believe in me. She's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long.

***Okay so I cant go into full detail as to what as all happened since this was bigger than I knew and it has turned into legal troubles, for them. &#x200B;

But I had to update everyone just a bit and thank all of you for you kindness. So that is all I can really say, Kid is safe, with bio dad family while things are looked into. So on that end I am glad the innocent one in this is safe. I figured it was a one and done no big deal and let it go. She brushes off my attempts to bring it up then suddenly had to go and she'd see me Friday and hung up. Reason why I was dealing with H instead of K is K doesn't bother to talk to her step brother, my fiance, really ever since she feels she is better than him. $3 an hour to babysit is way below my states minimum wage, it's a long time to babysit a child in my opinion, and they haven't been very open to talking since the call where I got told my payment and hung up on. I hate conflict and I honestly don't think telling them I need to be paid more would go over well. Edit 3: The kid lives at Grandma's with his mom. Mom works full time as well same age as me. He said he wanted to spend time with them since they are his family. Now, he is saying he had been hopeful they had changed since they haven't treated me like this ever before this event. Probably the biggest issue is yeah, I am starting to realize I am a doormat.

And thank you for all the awards. Needless to say, things went nuclear and my Dad asked for full custody with visitation for her. They had many issues due to her opinions but she eventually seemed to drop the “you need to reconcile with your Mother“ crusade. I immediately panicked and called my brothers. Sam thought maybe somehow she found out and wanted to crash so he called his Ex to let her know of the potential drama but she told him it was fine since she invited them, Sam hung up and asked me to go get him while oldest brother dealt with things at the church. Mom’s HB even called and said he always knew we were worthless. My nuclear family 100% supports Sam but the backlash has been huge. Edit: You guys just reassured us all, thank you. He says he stood up in front of everybody and told them Sam was not coming and to please go home and all their gifts delivered to our side of the family will be given back asap.

Rose was married to jim(33m) but she cheated on him a few months back which was awful and they’re getting a divorce

Now I hate cheaters as much as the next person and I was on Jims side at first but it’s gotten bad like really bad if you want a list I’ll add it in the comments 

One of the worse is him being his is currently in a relationship with Kim who is pregnant with his kid

Now when everything first came out she was his biggest cheerleader and was extremely cruel to rose which looking back now makes sense

When the relationship came out around Christmas Day in a big a fuck you way to rose everyone was disgusted, both Kim and Jim said they’re single adults who can date who they both like

Now onto this weeks make rose suffer part of their whole personality they want full custody of the kids look rose was wrong for cheating it was a terrible thing to do but at some point Jim/Kim’s treatment of her as become straight up harassment

today I came down stairs to rose crying and Kim berating her apparently Kim was telling rose that she’d make sure her girls (roses kids) would have a positive female role model with self respect and she’d make sure to teach them loyalty unlike their whore of a mother when they get full custody

I won’t lie guys I’m fucking sick of what they’re doing to her So I slammed the door of the kitchen really loud to get their attention I said

“Honestly Kim you’ve no room to talk about loyalty when you’re fucking your sisters husband and if I’m being honest no one and I mean NO ONE believes you cringey love story ether you were fucking before or he’s using you as a way to hurt rose, yes cheating is trashy but so is going after a family member’s ex or possibly current partner. Now get the fuck out no one wants you here you pick me cUnt and tell jim he has no chance at full custody maybe a straight jacket but that’s about it”

Kim tried to defend her self but I gave her what she gave rose I just kept calling her trash louder and louder till she left crying telling me I’ll never meet her kid which I said I don’t give a fuck

Our brothers are on my side so are most family members but jim,my aunt and some family friends are calling me an enabler and saying they hope I get cheated on to know how it feels

One thing about being in a small town gossip spreads like fire in a barn 

So enough with introductions and on to the tea

My auntie cats birthday was yesterday (she's 78) and we decided to host a party 

Everyone and there kitchen sink came (like all the businesses shut down because they were to busy at the farm)

My sis (23) we will call amy

and her boyfriend (23) we will call mat

 and his brother (15) who we will call tim they adopted came too 

Now I'm not going to get into the details but addiction runs in there family from what ik 

So we all go to my house (it's a one room building but I call it my house cuz my beds in there and my kitty cat )

And I start working on a golf cart that I got from our papa's cuz the seat is ugly and I was spray painting it with Tim and Amy and mat go and start a fire like 30 feet away 

So me and Tim go and we start talking and 2 hours later we hear 3 cars pull up with 50ish people who were drunker than bulls

Among them was a 24 pack of beers and mother dearest 

So they start doing what drunken people do and sit by the fire among us talking about how gen z doesn't know how to party 

So they start trying to get Amy and mat to start drinking so I tried to get Amy and them to go to the tree house with me but I don't think they heard me then I heard this exchange 

Mom: just one beer it's not going to get you drunk 

Mat: I really appreciate you offering but I really don't drink 

Mom:but..

Amy: he doesn't want to just let it be 

Mom: aww don't be such a sissy it's not like you're going to get addicted 

Which I thought was way out of the line so I said

Me: mom if he doesn't want to drink don't make him no means no your way over the gate 

Mom: oh relax it's fine he's a big boy he can stand up for himself 

Amy: she's right he said no I'm getting fed up with this nonsense 

Me: yeah if he says no it means no this ain't a negotiation he built a wall and you hopped it 

At this point no one else was talking and mat was looking kinda embarrassed but he did look happy I stood up for him 

Dad: young lady your the one hopping the line I'ma need to have a talk about respect 

Me and my sister mat and Tim road the horses  

Everyone went home and my parents haven't said anything to me but I'm in my house and haven't run into them

I went onto Facebook and there's a few post people made about my generation not having no respect 

But where I think I may be the but hole is I probably should have had a private talk but instead I disrespected my mom infront of the town which no doubt will be the gossip for the next week and people will take time on

Also I feel like maby I should have let Amy and mat speak for themselves but I'm not sure

I payed for her drinks this time to make her feel better. I also want to make it clear that my wife is conventionally attractive also just less so than Rachel. This doesn't mean I don't think my wife is more attractive than Rachel to me. I just mean objectively Rachel is better looking. In my opinion you should never publically criticise your partner so for me telling her privately that the jokes were inappropriate is enough. She said that it was a cruel thing to say and that she wasn't jealous of Rachel and insisted that the jokes were not offensive and everyone was just tiptoeing round the pretty girl.,0,866

#######OP########
It honestly feels ridiculous that I have to post this but my coworker has been getting onto me about this for weeks now, so I have to ask. This is the easiest, most convenient and intuitive way for me to eat potatoes (sweet potatoes or regular). So I work in an office of about 30 people. To tell if it's done, poke through the center with a knife or fork. Make sure you let the potato cool for at least 10 minutes (potentially longer) or it'll be too hot to eat. Sexual harassment is a really serious charge. No one else had ever had a problem with this until now. I had explained to her that this was how I grew up eating them and would not stop. As I explained my side, I could tell HR was getting really annoyed. Karen says that I lied about not doing anything to make her uncomfortable. That after the first time she came to me, asking me to eat my potatoes differently, I dismissed it as a joke (which to be fair, I did because, um,...deadass???). I responded by telling Karen I literally gave zero thought about her when I bought my potatoes and selected them based on ease of cooking/eating. Which I swear to god, HR almost laughed at her. Then Karen tried to turn it around by claiming I was making a hostile work environment by telling our other coworkers bad things about her. So I decided to file a report with HR, as suggested by many of you. I decided to keep my harassment claim with HR, and have another meeting tomorrow.

The NICU nurses are excellent and provide 24/7 care (makes me extra appreciative to have the Canadian healthcare system, otherwise I'd be close to bankrupt by now probably), which means that when we go, we help out with some tasks like diaper changes and feeding, to build some normalcy in the situation, but even if we aren't there these tasks are done by the nurses.

Day two, induction started early but labor never came. After the c-section, we spent several hours together with the baby.

Day three I was at the hospital all day except when I stepped out when my MIL was there. I had no idea she had any expectation of me to stay. I was nervous about being there after visiting hours as it was. 20 years ago fathers were still treated more like a nuisance than a partner.
