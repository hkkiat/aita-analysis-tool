"So I F(32) have been married to my husband M(34) for 6 years. Before we got married he had me sign a prenup stating that our financials would always be separate and the only thing we would share was an expense account to pay for household related fees. The reason for this was because he was making pretty good money and I was in graduate school so my financial situation was pretty bad but I signed nonetheless because I understood he wanted to protect himself. Anyway fast forward to now, I’ve been out of school for about 4 years and I make more than 3 times as much as he does. (I never asked how much he makes and he’s never asked me either).

Anyway 2 weeks ago I told him that I was thinking about buying a new car as one I had, was really old since I had had it since my undergraduate days. He wasn’t really interested and just told me to get whatever I liked. So a week ago I decided to make the plunge and get an Audi, I was pretty excited as I had always wanted one….(at the time my husband was on a business trip, he got back yesterday) and I showed him my car…he was really happy for me, however later he asked me what my monthly payments were as the Audi was pretty new…at this point I told him that I had made the purchase in cash and that I had no monthly payments. He was taken back and asked with what money and I answered that I made more than enough money to be able to afford it. He didn’t talk after that and I thought that was that………however after a few hours he came back to me and told that he thinks we should void the prenup……This is where I might be the asshole I laughed in his face and asked him why I would agree to that and his answer was that we’re married and should share our financials. So I told him that we’ve been married for 6 years and yet we’ve never shared financials and I was fine with what we were doing, and his sudden change of heart was very suspicious. He called me a bunch of names and stormed out and didn’t come home and and I guess he told his family about our fight and they called to berate me and say how he supported me while I was in school (he didn’t) and now am wondering if I was the asshole??

Edit: I knew his salary when we got together, however he’s since gotten promoted and at first when I used to ask he would make comments that it was rude of me to ask how much he made so I stopped…he’s never really been interested in my career or job and we don’t bring our work home…. The reason I make 3x what he makes (I made the assumption from what I knew his salary had been) is because I work as a CRNA and he works as a software engineer.



Edit 2: I didn’t expect so many comments, thanks everyone for sharing your opinions….This post has really made me question everything in my life, I think am going to take a leave of absence from my work  to sort out my life…..My husband was only my second relationship and I guess I was too caught up in school, work and debt to really see that my marriage was a sham….am not blameless which is hard to swallow, so I am going to have conversation with my husband and see where we go from here if anywhere.

Last Edit: Since it’s been a point of contention am gonna clear up a few things….I make 175 an hour and work between 40 to 48 hours a week…..from what I know he made about 90k when we got together am sure it higher now(he also works less hours)…we live in a state that is not expensive so my monthly contribution is about 1000-1200 a month….he had some property in NE so he wanted to protect that and I had debt from school (he did too but mine was bigger).",0
"This might seem silly. I (24F) like wearing cheerful socks, since my uniform is all white (currently working as an phlebotomist), it usually cheers up the patients too. 

I've spent a few years collecting strange socks, ones with sushi, pizza, corgis, cats, Nick Cage, etc. I think I had about 30 pairs. My boyfriend (29M) has always hated them, and thinks they're childish. So I agreed to only wear them to work, and never on dates or around his friends/family. I thought that was fair. 

On boxing day his parents came over for coffee and gifts (just the 4 of us, which is allowed where I live, and keeping a solid 3 meters apart). I accidentally put on a pair of 'childish' socks, and his mother made a comment about it. I explained that I wear them to work to cheer people up, and she liked that. My boyfriend didn't. 

The next day all my socks were gone, and the drawer was filled with plain black socks. I asked my boyfriend, and he told me he threw them away and purchased some more 'appropriate' socks, so I won't embarrass him in front of his parents again. 

I told him that that's insane, they were mine and he had no right to throw them away. Not to mention that I spend quite some time collecting them. 

So I made a list of the ones I remembered I had, and told him that I expect the same ones as a replacement. He told me that's completely unreasonable, and that it would take a lot of time/effort/money for him to find those specific pairs. I haven't changed my mind yet, they cost me a lot of time and effort to find too. 

I think he's being controlling, he thinks I'm being unreasonable and demanding. 

AITA?

I think I might be an asshole for asking for the exact same pairs, I know that'll take a lot of effort to find.

Edit: Thanks everyone for replying, I've realised that this might not be a 'normal' fight and am evaluating the relationship.",0
"I (44f) have a twenty-three year old biological son as well as three foster children 2 boys (9 and 17) and one girl (12.) I have been a foster parent since my son was four. I am a social worker as well. He has gone through life understanding the system and the horrors these kids face. The three that I have right now I am planning to adopt. I love them as my own. The last two Christmas’ I have not had my biological son, Tyler, home. He has spent them with his girlfriend and wife now of eight months family. I have always respected it. She is much less independent than Tyler and her family suffered the loss of a grandfather so they wanted her there for the holidays. This Christmas Tyler has been telling me that him and Sonia (my DIL) will spend Christmas with our family. Well the day before yesterday Tyler told me he feels like he owes a debt to Sonia’s family for the extravagant wedding gift they gave them and he felt pressured to spend another holiday with them. I didn’t believe him. I know when my son is lying. After pressing for about fifteen minutes he revealed to me that Sonia felt uncomfortable spending Christmas at our home because it did not feel genuine. She says that my foster children are not real family so it takes away from the spirit of the holiday. I would never let anyone be so disrespectful to Tyler so why would I let this fly with my other children? I told him fine but if she doenst feel comfortable at Christmas then I don’t ever feel comfortable with her around my kids, and she cannot step foot in this house again. I have always treated her with kindness and respect. I love her because she loves my son and he loves her, but I will not let anyone exclude my children. My husband believes I am going to cause a wedge between us and our son, but right now I am so so disappointed in him. This is not who I raised him to be maybe a wedge is needed for him to come to his senses. So reddit am I the asshole? 

TLDR: My DIL doesn’t consider my family genuine because I have foster children so she and my son will be spending the third Christmas in a row with her family. I told my son she is no longer welcome at my home.",0
"I (27F and manager) have a coworker (31f) who is a self-appointed general manager (GM) at a restaurant, even though we share the same duties except that she makes the schedule. She also has a MAIN job where she gets paid more, and she always says she sacrifices that job to work at the restaurant. Recently, she started scheduling herself more, regardless of the people who need to work at the restaurant because it’s their only job.

This “GM” is feared by the restaurant staff (including the owner) because she throws a tantrum and cries when anything goes remotely against her wishes. She’s rude but justifies it by saying she’s just a savage (I don’t know why this is a flex) and uses her scheduling powers to bully people by not giving them shifts. For example, if you get on her nerves, you only get to work two shifts the next week, etc. So, naturally, no one enjoys working with her, and the staff gets tense and stressed whenever she’s around. She thinks we’re best friends tho for some reason. I’ve never really confided in her or considered her a friend. 

Last Tuesday, we were scheduled to work at the same time, but she texted me that I didn’t have to work an hour before my shift because it would not be busy with no reservations. I texted her that I wanted to work because I was scheduled, was already getting ready, and wanted to work; I told her I figured she’d want to rest since she scheduled herself six days at the restaurant, and on the one day off, she was working at her other job. She then called me multiple times, but I didn’t respond because I was on the phone with my sister. After I got off the phone with my sister, I saw texts saying she “misinterpreted” my message when I said I wanted to work. I then replied that I didn’t think there was anything that could be misinterpreted, and then she got really upset that I didn’t answer and texted that she was misinterpreting my message and that we’d talk face-to-face when we both got to the restaurant to start our shift.

At the restaurant, we went aside to talk. She immediately starts crying when we’re alone, saying that she thought we were “better friends” and that I’m holding back what I *really* want to say, accusing me of penalizing her for having two jobs, saying that she’ll never complain about being tired about her two jobs, pretty much accusing me of bullying her because I wanted to work (it really makes no sense). All the while, I am not sure how to respond since I only texted that I wanted to work verbatim: “You’re scheduled to work 6 days this week, I want to work since I’m already ready and you can be off. This is my only job, so I want to work.” Then she cries some more, storms out, and goes home, as to which all staff were relieved.

AITA for wanting work and that instead, she could be off? Did I penalize her for having two jobs? 
I ONLY HAVE ONE JOB. ONE SOURCE OF INCOME. 
she made me feel like I bullied her even though the only thing I said was that I wanted to work. AM I THE BULLY lo",0
"For my(32M) birthday I always like one specific kind of cake a chocolate-covered cherry cake. My mom or dad always made it for me since it wasn't one of the available flavors at any bakeries or stores near where we grew up. When I moved away I started to make it myself. I've been married to my wife just under a year but we've been together for 6 years so she knows all about this cake. During that time we've either baked it together, my parents made it, or I've made it on my own. I've never asked or expected her to do it.

Before my birthday this year my wife asked me what kind of cake I wanted. Same kind as always but she told me she didn't feel like baking. I told her she didn't need to worry about baking it because I can just do it myself. She asked me a second time and I gave her the same answer. The day before my birthday I get home from work and have all the ingredients to make my cake. Go to get something out of the fridge and there's a pair of cheesecakes in there with 'Happy Birthday' written between them both. I asked my wife about it and she said those were the cakes for my party the next day and she thought of switching things up this year since ""everyone loves cheesecake"".

I don't hate it but she gets cheesecakes at least once a month. I only ever have the cherry cake on my birthday. I told her I appreciate it and they look good but I really want the cake I like so I was going to make mine and we'll just let everyone have a choice of what cake they want. She got pissed off and yelled that I ruined her attempt to make things easier on us by not having to bake and bringing cake that everyone would love. It's been two days since the party and she was cold at the party and is still acting cold. Usually I move mountains and heaven to give her the things she wants on her birthdays and celebrate how she wants, I just wanted one specific cake for mine. AITA?

Update: The recipe for everyone asking:

 1 box chocolate cake mix

1 jar maraschino cherries

1 can cherry pie filling

1 teaspoon almond extract

1 container cool whip (2-3 cups might work, I like to slather the whole container on)

Chocolate sauce

Rum to taste

Make the cake mix as directed, mix in the maraschino cherries, almond extract, and rum. Bake, take out and let it cool. Mix together the cool whip and cherry pie filling, ice the top of the cake and all sides. Drizzle with the desired amount of chocolate sauce.",0
"Yesterday, a neighbor I never talked to before contacted me by text message with a complaint about my 2 sheep. We are both in our 50s.

I own a small parcel of land where I live alone with my 2 cats and 2 sheep. A lot of the land is unconstructed and basically only wild grass, and I let my sheep navigate freely so they can eat all the grass freely. This parcel is located in a semi-rural area. I have neighbors close by in all direction but we are all homeowners and away from the city.

The neighbor I asking me to restrict the area in which my sheep are able to roam, as they claim that ""we are not in an agricultural zone"", as if we were, the city would have not allowed them to build their villa close to my house, and they are seemingly allergic to my sheep. They claim to have been suffering the consequences of the allergy for close to a year now and cannot properly enjoy their home with my sheep around.

I find this request completely ludicrous as my sheep always stay on my land, I never take them outside of the parcel I own and while, admittedly their pen are next to the road separating their house to mine, they do not stay in the pen very often, mostly at night, and during the day roam on my land, which is further away from their property.

My gut reaction was to ignore this request and keep things as is, but I would also like to know what you guys think. Would I be the Asshole?",0
"My husband has full custody of his eleven year old son because stepson's mother is an addict and currently on probation in a completely different state with no visitation rights. Her parents have no legal rights to see stepson, but my husband allows them to even though they are rude and combative.

Husband doesn't allow stepson to spend the night, but he made an exception for the fourth of July because stepson wanted to set off fireworks with his cousins who were visiting the grandparents. Husband worked the next day and explained to the grandparents that I would be picking stepson up first thing in the morning, otherwise the sleepover wouldn't happen.

I got there the morning of the fifth at 9AM and was told to come back later because they just started breakfast. I refused and said I would get stepson breakfast but we needed to leave because I had things to do. Husband told them son needed to be ready by nine. Stepson's grandma basically refused to hand him over and I said that I would call the police.

Grandma said she had more of a right to stepson than me and I was on her property so she could call the police. I laughed at her and said my husband has full custody and she has no rights. I said that if she doesn't hand stepson over husband will call, stepson will be retrieved and there will be no more visits.

She went and got him. Stepson said he had fun with the fireworks. Later, without the adrenaline of the argument, I wonder if I went to far. Maybe I could have just waited half an hour and then asked again. I know husband wanted stepson picked up at nine, but 9:30 wouldn't have ruined any plans, and it seems stepson did enjoy his time with his grandparents, even if they are rude and hateful to me, that relationship is still important to him. AITA?",0
"So I (f44) go to my local gym (UK) every morning at 7am. There are two carparks, a smaller one directly in front of the gym, and a huge ""overflow"" one about 200m away, around the corner from the door. If I happen to go to the gym at any other time other than my early morning slot, I generally head for the overflow carpark as the nearer carpark is always full, and the overflow is almost always practically empty. However at my regular early time, the gym is quiet and I can just park near the gym. 

When I have finished in the gym, I sit in the car and have a coffee and some porridge I take with me, before I go to work. By this time, the car park is full. This morning, a couple in a big wagon pulled up opposite where I was sat eating, and basically just stared at me, waiting for me to move. I didn't want to make eye contact so I carried on eating. After a couple of minutes, there is a tap on my window, which I wind down, and the woman asks me if I'm nearly finished. I tell her that I'm having my breakfast and then I will leaving, but if they go around the corner there is a large car park with plenty of space. She says no, they ""like to park here"" and continues to state at me for a response. So I just return to my porridge and after a minute or so, she turns round and leaves, making huffing noises and the wagon drives off aggressively round the corner. 

I might add, these are not handicap spaces or child spaces (there are some of  those, and they were empty). It's my opinion that if you are coming to the gym, surely you are capable of walking an extra 200m? I can't eat my breakfast in the gym - there is a cafe but purchasing their food everyday is not practical. 

So in the context of car park etiquette, AITA?",0
"My (34f) husband (35m) and I moved for work. I'm a secondary school teacher, he's a uni professor, and both of our jobs are online due to Covid indefinitely. 

 When we got here, we had three weeks to find an apartment, and I had my heart set on a specific neighborhood (lots of parks, quiet, coffee shops). However, in our first week of looking, my husband fell in love with an apartment in a neighborhood that I hate (very corporate, bars/clubs/fast food for tourists, no green space). The apartment itself was admittedly the best overall, but I wanted to see if we could find something similar in the better neighborhood. The apartment my husband loved was rented after a couple days and he was gutted and couldn't get on board with any place we looked at, so when we found out that someone was moving at the end of the month from an identical unit, I decided to fold because I couldn't stand how disappointed he was.

The apartment has three bedrooms, with two of them being huge master suites with attached bathrooms, and a smaller bedroom already set up as a home office (it came furnished). My husband has sensory issues, OCD, and an elaborate setup for work, so I decided when we moved in that I would make the guest bedroom my home office just by moving a small desk in beside the bed and working in the living room if we have guests (I can work anywhere, used to grade papers in bars), and he could have the smaller bedroom as his undisturbed office zone. 

The guest room is huge with spectacular view of a big private garden-- the green space I wish I had. Unfortunately, this room can't be our bedroom because there is a lot of street noise in the day and my husband works odd hours where he sometimes sleeps during the day.  

My husband is outraged that I claimed the guest room. He wants to remove the king bed from the guest room and make the small room my home office and a guest room with a smaller bed (the king wouldn't fit)  because I ultimately spend less time in my ""office"" than he does in his (8 hours a day vs. 12, more when he has a deadline). I feel it would be extremely rude to give guests (like his mother, who is planning to visit for at least a month this year) a smaller room with a smaller bed with a bathroom down the hall while my husband puts two desks and a table in a room that is 50% bigger with two big closets and a private bathroom. I also offered up the dining room, which we don't use, as more of his ""zone"" in addition to the small bedroom, as it is also large with a nice view, but there is no closing door.

My husband feels like I ""stole"" this room from him and resents me for not telling him I was going to claim it before we moved in, I feel like we are living in the apartment he wanted in a neighborhood I hate and he should be able to compromise on this one thing. For what it's worth, I also earn double his salary and pay 75% of the rent/bills. Am I being the asshole?",0

"I (22f) don’t like to watch a ton of media and Im quite selective on what I do watch, but my bf (23m) is the opposite and watches everything. Recently he’s been trying to get me to watch dragon ball and I sat through one of the movies with him, now I watched a little bit of z when I was younger and knew it really wasn’t my type of show. I told him this after we had finished the movie and he asked me why so I explained I wasn’t a big fan of the tropes and he got upset and said that I just hate what he likes.

Recently we were chatting with some of his friends over discord and he brought it up in front of them saying things like “yeah I need someone to watch this with because my gf hates it” “She hates everything that I like” it made me embarrassed to have it brought up in front of everyone so I defended myself and he privately texted me that he didn’t know how to talk to me without me getting upset and that it was just back and forward finger pointing. 

I guess I just don’t understand I really do try to watch some of what he likes. I don’t enjoy superhero movies but we go and watch every one that comes out. I played his favorite game with him for about 2-3 years but he would get upset if I said I wanted to play I game I liked instead (even if I said I’d play it alone) and when he did join he would say the game is bad and he doesn’t know how I play a game like this. Then he would proceed to complain that the it’s the only game I want to play and when I would bring up that he doesn’t have to play it with me he would say that he loves me so he will. One day I pushed back on his complaining and he went quiet and texted me that he was upset that he couldn’t just complain freely without someone combating him.

Am I doing something to cause conflict?",0
"Long time lurker first time poster and sorry for mistakes english is not my native tongue

So I (29f) have designed all the wedding dresses for my cousins, siblings, and aunts for the past decade. When my eldest sister (35f) got engaged at 24 she asked me to design her dress since I'm passionate about design and she always loved my style. Her dress was a knock out, everyone loved it and ever since when ever one of our relatives announces their engagement they ask if I can design their dress for them. I've always said yes because I absolutely love doing it just so much fun. 

On to the issue, my cousin (23f) is getting married next February and called me up to see when we could meet so she could share her ideas for her dress and I can start designing it. I do not like this cousin at all, her parents spoiled her beyond rotten. I decided to still meet with her though and see if anything has changed since she's now an adult. She immediately shows me some photos of wedding dresses by Sara Burton and tells me she wants something exactly like the pictures, I try to suggest a change in neckline or color and she shuts it down and tell me she wants exactly that. I told her I would not be making her dress as I love designing clothes that embody their wearer and suit them, not rip off others designers so she can look fancy in a knock off.

Some of my family and especially her and her parents are beyond upset and have been blowing up my phone because I've ""broken tradition and my baby cousins heart because she's been looking forward to having me make her wedding dress for years now""

I feel kind of bad but at the same time she's taking the fun and bonding out of designing a wedding dress.",0
"Context: my sister has been pregnant for 5 months now and my family has been waiting for a while. So when she told the news everyone was very excited and treated her like she was a queen who couldn’t be touched. I was happy to i was having a niece and all but it was going way over board.

About a month ago i found out i was pregnant and me and my husband had been trying for a while so this news was beyond happiness for our family. I was ready to tell my family at dinner and once i did my sister got really red and started yelling at me saying i was an attention seeker and said i knew she was gonna tell us her baby’s gender at this dinner . I yelled back at her because she was way out of line i explained to her she needs to stop and sit down and it had NOTHING to do with her and stop being so self centered

After i yelled my mom stood up and asked me what was wrong with me for yelling at my sister and went on a rant about how it was bad for the baby. I was furious. I was pregnant to but she can yell at me?
 Me and my husband then walked out as he called them ridiculous and my mom shut the door on his face

It’s been 3 weeks now and my family has been trying to contact me saying i’m being ridiculous and dramatic and i needed to be more mature and sensitive to my sister

AITA?

EDIT: For those who are confused I did NOT know she was telling us her baby’s gender she didn’t say she had a surprise or anything it was originally just a get together",0
"Years ago, I was married to a close friend. We were roommates, adopted a dog together, and lived together since college until our mid/late twenties (married at 24 and 25). However, we were never actually romantically involved. She was not interested in marriage and also questioning her sexuality at the time, but her family was ultra-traditional (and messy for many other reasons) and kept pushing for her to ""settle down"". I had just gotten out of a rough long term relationship, and we kind of just both said fuck it, we basically were kind of living like a married couple, lets get married for convenience. So we did the paperwork for it, but we never had a wedding. We were also never romantically involved. She just was not my type and I was not hers. My family knew she wasn't my wife in the traditional sense (they did HEAVILY disapprove though).

When I started getting back into the dating scene, we split up and legally divorced. She remains one of my close friends to this very day, and I care for her a lot. It's been a few years, and I am now 32 with a lovely fiance who I cannot wait to marry. However, ever since I announced the engagement my family has been making weird comments, like:

""Oh, so Roxie's (my dog) is getting a new step-mom!""

""Wife #2 at 32 huh? That's a lot of wives for your age!""

""Let's hope this 2nd one lasts!""

It makes both me and my fiance uncomfortable. I keep on saying that my close friend wasn't really my wife in the traditional sense, but my family brushes me off by saying that they're just joking, or she's technically my second wife anyway so it's not like they're wrong. Today at breakfast though, I blew up at them and called them disrespectful and rude for belittling my relationship. My mom and my sister both said that if I didn't want to hear these statements, I shouldn't have married my close friend. I threatened to not invite them to the wedding, and now things are super tense. AITA?

Some edits from the comments I made to help answer some common questions:

Why I married my close friend: Health insurance, mostly, but also because they kept holding her tuition over her head. We were both in grad school at the time (she was gunning for a PhD, I was going for a masters but I had a job in an energy commission with some benefits). They’d always tell her that they’d stop sending her money or (some months when the arguing was bad) not send her money at all. They used money to punish her, basically. She had a lot of health issues at the time that she couldn’t get help for, like chronic pain and wisdom teeth that really needed to be removed, alongside some other personal issues. 

So getting married got them off her back about her sexuality, got her on my health insurance plan, and got them to be more consistent on sending tuition money for her. There were a few other things too, like how they kept setting up potential arranged marriages for her or threatening to take her home to their country. There was also a time when they threatened to have her committed to a mental health facility.

At the time, she was also really reluctant on letting me help her beyond minor things because she felt like it was something she had to repay. So between us, it also gave me an “excuse” to help her. I’d be like “hey, it’s what your spouse is supposed to do, right?” Even though we both agreed that our marriage was a farce, I think it did something for her psychologically to accept that we had a legally binding relationship where I could help her. I don’t know, it was complicated but it was something that worked for us. I was able to pay for her treatment and let her use my money for herself.She has now graduated and is financially stable. To my knowledge she no longer speaks with most of her family. She's doing amazing for herself and I am so damn proud of her.

My fiance: My fiancé knows about my past marriage and has no issue with it. I met her through my close friend, actually, as a mutual of a mutual! At the time I was already split from my close friend, and while she was initially confused, me and my close friend both sat her down and explained things as clearly as possible. She understands why we did what we did.

My family: I was always 100% transparent with my family on my marriage with my close friend. My family understood that I went through a rough relationship before my marriage. I think my mom’s exact words at the time were “I won’t force you to do anything, but I’m really disappointed that you take marriage so lightly.” They understood that I married my close friend to help her, but I also got the slight impression that they figured everything would sort itself out with our marriage (i.e. I would fall in love with her or something). My aunts and uncles didn’t say much else than that they were disappointed that they couldn’t attend a real wedding. When I met my fiancé, I told them how it was a big deal to me that it was my first, genuine, supportive romantic relationship in a long time. At the time, they all seemed happy for me and no comments like these came up. They told me they were glad I was able to find love again. It was only when we announced the engagement that these comments started.",0
"When I [19F] was growing up, I was painfully shy, and I also wasn’t very attractive — I had crooked teeth and terrible style and had yet to gain confidence. I mostly kept to myself. When I started middle school, I took piano lessons at school. Because I was so shy, I would just focus on playing instead of socializing with the other students.

One day, a boy in the class, A, was talking with one of his friends. We wore headphones, but I could still hear what they were saying. A was joking around with his friends about girls. A told his friend “you should ask op out” and started laughing. His friend responded “ew, that’s disgusting” and they both started laughing. A said, “if you don’t, I will!” Obviously they were asking me out as a joke. A came up to me snickering and said “will you be my girlfriend?” I quickly said no and turned up the volume on my computer. I was blinking back tears as he laughed with her friends. After a few more incidents like that, I actually ended up quitting piano. I wish I hadn’t, but I was a kid and didn’t want to put up with having my insecurity pointed out more.

Anyway, fast forward to now. I go to a university and have grown into myself. I did debate in high school which gave me confidence and puberty wasn’t too terrible to me. A ran into me on campus, and I immediately got nervous. It was bizarre, I felt immediately in the same headspace as middle school me. But A was just so shocked to see me, and was saying things like “I can’t believe how long it’s been!” He was super casual and even a little flirty. Through the course of the convo mentioned an event that an org I belonged to was hosting, which is really fun and big, which most people know about. He asked if I was taking anyone, kinda suggesting he was free. I hadn’t planned on taking anyone, so I gave him the extra ticket I had.

Afterwards, a few days later, I felt really small. I decided I wanted to talk to him about middle school at the event. I was kinda looking for closure, even though I’d already processed my insecurities from middle school. That weekend at the event, I kinda pulled him aside and told him about how he’s the reason I quit piano. I tried to be as gracious as possible about it, but I ended up tearing up a little. He didn’t remember at all, and he obviously felt very uncomfortable. He ended up leaving early.

I kinda feel like an asshole for inviting him out and ruining the event for him. Like, I probably should’ve confronted him earlier and/or not given him the invite at all. But at the same time, I didn’t want to just let it slide like I always did in middle school. AITA for not saying something earlier? Should I apologize for bringing something up that he didn’t even remember doing? And did I do too much considering he was literally a kid too?",0
"Throwaway as some of the people involved are on reddit.

I have a daughter Emma(7) and she has a best friend Kat (7). They knew each other since prep school and are unseparatable since. However they are not allowed to stay overnight at each other places as Emma is allergic to strawberries which Kat loves, and Kat is allergic to nuts, while Emma loves hazelnut and Nutella specifically.

4 months ago Emma received an invitation from Kat to her birthday party, which has been accepted. I have asked Kat's mother before if I need to bring something for Emma, but she assured me everything is fine. When we arrived the entire part was strawberry themed and all the food (they only served sweet stuff) had strawberries in them. Due to this Emma gave the present she made to Kat and we left shortly after as I don't want to expose my child to allergies. Kat was told that Emma wasn't feeling well and we didn't want to risk if its covid.

Yesterday was Emma's birthday. She wanted a Nutella cake so one was ordered. I have warned Kat's mum that the cake will contain Nutella but cupcakes and other deserts are nut free. She knew about that and everything went fine until Kat had to be rushed to the hospital due to allergic reaction. Kats mum forgot that Nutella contains nuts and let Kat to have a slice while me and my husband were not watching. 

She called me an asshole as she felt I was getting back at her for throwing a strawberry party and now her child is hurt. She also said it in front of Emma so she is now feeling guilty and refuses to eat anything.

Aita for ordering a Nutella cake for my daughters birthday?

Edit: I just want to add, in my country (not English speaking) Nutella is advertised as a chocolate spread, not as hazelnut one, so a lot of  people don't realise it contains nuts, hence why I had to warn Kat's mum about them

Edit 2: so I have been told about another strawberry party post. Some details match except both of the kids are girls, party was 4 months ago when strawberry was in season and Emma was invited and her mother told me that Emma will have something to eat there.

Also Kat called Emma earlier on today and said the reason why she ate the cake was because her mum said it was fine for her to eat as it was chocolate, not hazelnut and she loves chocolate. If her mum wouldn't tell her that she wouldn't of touched the cake as she liked the cupcakes more.

Edit 3: just a small thing. Due to how busy the bakery was and many other horror stories I've heard, the Nutella cake alongside with cupcakes and other cake based sweets were ordered before the strawberry party invitation. In fact Kats strawberry cake and Emma's Nutella cake both came from the same bakery. I do not know when Kats mother ordered hers in, but assume a while back as well since the bakery is incredibly busy and popular",0
"I'll try to keep details vague. 

My SO comes from a culture that equates hospitality with food. When you are a guest, you are served tons of food. Even on a casual visit, they will put stuff in front of you an of course you have to eat. 

Now this sounds perfectly fine, but they expect you to eat repeated servings and won't take no for an answer. I am ready to eat whenever we are there, but I just can't keep up. And the worst thing, they will always push for more. They will ask if you want more, and you say: ""no, thank you, this was delicious! I am full!"" but they will keep adding food onto your plate without blinking. And of course it's considered incredibly rude not to eat. It's typically grandmothers and older women who push the most and who ignore your polite 'no, thank you'.

Formal dinners and lunches are the worst. The amount of food could feed a family for a week, and this is admirable, but I just can't eat THAT much. And I can't stand them (my SO's mother and grandmother) putting stuff on my plate when I repeatedly plead I can't have more.

Which brings me to a recent incident. A semi-formal lunch. They prepared a meal I said I liked the previous time (I do like it, but in moderation), and they presented it as something they made just for me. I was touched of course but I also dreaded the whole thing because not eating enough is an insult. 

I ate a full plate and then some, but I couldn't eat anything above that (espec. because there were some other courses to try) and when the grandmother started the usual spiel of 'oh, try just a bit more', and started pushing food on my plate, I've had enough. I pulled my plate away from her reach and said enough, stop insisting. 

This made them all uncomfortable. The grandma seemed really hurt and I get it but I just couldn't deal with that anymore. My SO was really angry and on our way home told me it was really rude, they only meant well, why didn't I tell them nicely I couldn't eat more? That's the thing, I did! Now they are all angry with me for rejecting their hospitality AND for making them sound unreasonable. AITA?

EDIT: Just to clarify a few things. We always get food to take home; that is  given. So telling them: ""I am full now, but can you please pack this to take home?"" won't change a thing. 

And this is about cultural differences basically, but I feel uncomfortable that some people attack my in-laws and their culture, and assume that our ways are objectively superior. There is no objectively superior way here, which doesn't mean there are no frustrations, which is why I posted this question in the first place.",0
"My husband (35M) and I (28F) have 2 beautiful children (5M, 3F) and I am currently pregnant with my third child.

Recently, my MIL has fallen onto hard times and lost her apartment. My husband invited her to live with us, which I wasn’t originally happy about because with the little one on the way I wanted time to focus on our family, but I ultimately understood that it’s a special circumstance.

The problem is that MIL has really changed since she got here. We used to have a relatively good relationship, but she’s increasingly been demanding and unreasonable. I know it’s a hard time, so I’ve tried to be accommodating, but it’s all getting to be too much.

For example, she’s been asking that we buy specific brands when getting groceries, which would be fine if they were just for her, but she’s been insisting that the cereal brand we feed my kids isn’t healthy and they have to eat a different brand. The one we buy is the one they like and it’s not particularly unhealthy as far as cereals go. She’s also been moving our furniture around, primarily the guest room that she’s staying in but recently she had my husband swap the couch and the armchair in the living room while I was out running errands.

All this is fine, I love my husband and my MIL and can understand what she’s going through, so I can deal with it.

It all finally came to a boiling point last night.

My husband and I have been having a disagreement lately. Usually, my husband makes his own lunch to take with him to work. However, since I’ve recently quit my job to become a stay at home mom, he thinks I should start making his lunch along with the children’s lunches. My husband goes to work an hour and a half before the children go to daycare. I currently wake up around the time he leaves for work and have plenty of time to get the kids ready and make their lunches. If I were to make his lunch, I would have to get up way earlier. We’re at an impasse on this issue right now.

Apparently, he complained to his mother about it, because she confronted me last night about being a bad wife. In her words, I’m “not good enough” for her son if I can’t even “make this one sacrifice to make him happy”.

Being confronted like this just made me so mad and I don’t even know why. I snapped and yelled back at her and said some things I regret.

Now my husband expects me to give my MIL an apology and start packing his lunch, and neither of them are talking to me until then.

My husband and I have never had problems like this before. He’s always been so good to me. I’m worried that I’m overreacting and making and already difficult time even harder. I’ve never snapped like that before but I just feel so overwhelmed and I don’t have anyone in real life to talk to about this because my family doesn’t understand my relationship with my husband and don’t support us.

Anyways, i arrive home and head over  my kitchen, and then i  cook MY steak and MY shrimp, im already in a bad mood from a bad day at work. As im sitting ready to eat my food she comes in the kitchen asking for some, i said no. She starts begging, usually she takes the food from me and start laughing.

"I’m 26 weeks pregnant and my clothes have become too tight. This is my second pregnancy and I bought a lot of maternity clothes during my first but I donated them to a friend who is also pregnant but was going through some financial hardships as she needed them more than I do. I was going to buy more maternity clothes when I needed them but I’ve started wearing my husband clothes and I find them a lot more comfortable and it’s not like I’m going to work every day so I’ve decided not to.

My husband mostly doesn’t complain about me stealing his clothes all of the time and I’ve had dinner with his family twice wearing his clothes. They’ve never said anything to me directly but my sister-in-law told my husband to ask me to wear something more suitable the next time as her parents would be there. I saw her texts and they really upset me so I’m refusing to buy maternity clothes just for their stupid dinners.

My husband offered to go buy some for me and has even tried dangling the idea of us going somewhere nice for a date soon to try to convince me I need them but I haven’t budged. I did text my sister-in-law to let her know I didn’t appreciate it but that only opened the door for her to try to convince me/argue with me over me needing maternity clothes.

"I 17F have a autistic brother 6M he's not a bad kid he's non-verbal but is vocal. Now that it's summer we're both out of school. His Father sometimes takes care of him and provides for him.

His father doesn't usually take responsibility outside of what the court has ordered and sometimes even goes against it. 

Now that he doesn't want to be responsible, my mother relies on me to provide (paid)childcare for her. But I don't want to seeing as though it is my last summer ever and I wanted to make the most of it seeing that I work in the afternoons(6-10) and my mother gets home at 5 from her job.

On Monday morning I woke up to a text message from my mom telling me to take care of my brother for day because his father didn't show up.  Which happens a lot when we have school breaks and I usually take care of him. My mom Always parades me for being selfish for not wanting to watch him and I understand that it lowkey is but it does take a toll on me

"Yesterday was my nephew's 1st birthday, and my sister and BIL had a little get together at their house. When it was time for cake, they brought out my nephew's ""smash cake""—exactly what it sounds, a cake for the baby to smash up and get icing all over themselves for cute pictures or whatever. 

I kind of imagined that it would be the size of a big cupcake, but they brought out a regular-sized round birthday cake. I just kind of figured they splurged and still expected the cake to just be for him to play around with. BUT. After my nephew had gone at this cake with his bare hands, and stuck his whole face in it, my sister started scooping up the mangled remains and distributing servings to everyone (just a handful of family members.) And everyone else was actually eating it!

I declined because...seriously? I didn't want to eat something that has had a baby's grubby hands and body all over it, and I was surprised that anyone else did. My sister insisted I take a portion and I said ""Really, no, that's gross."" Now...I probably wouldn't have used the word gross if I wasn't on the spot, but I was not at all prepared to have to politely decline to eat baby spit. My sister was very hurt by that and told me later (on a phone call that I thought was way longer than it needed to be for the severity of the infraction) that she thought I was being extremely judgemental, that it wasn't a big deal, we're all family, don't participate if I really don't want to but don't call her gross, etc.",0
"My 19-year old daughter Vanessa called me this morning and told that her girlfriend proposed to her, and wants her to move to her apartment. Now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they’ve never don’t ever SEE each other besides a few quick weekend visits. Moreover, they’ve only dated for a little more than a year. 

I told her I was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. But I maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.

The problem lies when Vanessa asked me for money. You see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, I decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn’t have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). That combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn’t have to work at all during the school year. 

Since I gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. I told Vanessa that I was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.

She now says that she’s moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. Her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in IT). She said that now she’s not going to school, she’d rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.

I told her I cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. If/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she’s married, I’ll be happy to contribute the money. But it’s not just a free handout.

She’s got really mad that I rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. To her credit, her brother and I have a closer relationship (he’s always been the studious rule-follower while Vanessa was more the troublemaker), but I do love my children equally. I told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiancé, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. That if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, I will fully support it financially.

Well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. My wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but I told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and I rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and WHEN she has to move back home. I don’t want her to think I support this decision.

She told me she sorta saw my point, but she’s not going to help me unravel this mess with my Vanessa, she’s staying out of it. I, on the other hand, think she’s acting like a spoiled brat. AITA for sticking to my guns on this?",0
"So, I’m due with our 3rd baby in April. I’m having a scheduled c section. Which will be my third time going under the knife. My recovery has always been pretty rough after. As to be expected it’s a major abdominal surgery. He’s getting 2 weeks paid leave from his job, which isn’t a lot but we’re grateful it’s paid nonetheless. Now, any time we start talking about it; or especially when we’re arguing he is very quick to say his leave is for baby only and not for me. That he will be home to help with baby. I already have a 7yo and 2yo and will absolutely need help with them. Especially my 2yo. But also myself. Is he right? If your partner was taking parental leave would you only take it for the baby?",0
"My ex and I divorced about 12 years ago. We have a 15 year old son together. She married a guy a couple of years later. He has a daughter who is four years older than my son. So my son has known her for about ten years. She has always been nice to him and there has never been any serious arguments between them. My ex and her husband live about an hour and a half from town. So when she got into college they decided they didn't want her commuting three hours a day, especially in Manitoba winters. So they budgeted for her to live with friends while she was in school. 

I have known the girl since she was 7 years old. She is an intelligent, charming, and friendly kid. She is also burnt out from school. 

I am not going to defend her actions. She lied to my ex and her father about dropping out of college. She did her first semester but she was overwhelmed and dropped out. And she didn't tell them. But she kept the money they sent her for housing and food. 

She should not have lied but I understand why she did. They cut off her funding and told her to get a job. Which is totally fair. If you aren't in school you should be supporting yourself. 

She had enough money to make it to July. She found a job but it didn't pay enough to cover living in the city. Her dad and my ex would not let her move home. 

My son called me to ask if I could help her out. I thought about it and I said I would. I have room in my house. So I told him to have her call me. 

We talked about it and she moved in at the beginning of August. She is paying rent she can afford and buying her own food. She is also doing chores around the house. 

My ex found out what I did and lost it on me. Their plan was for her to be so desperate that she agreed to go back to college with them keeping a much closer eye on her. I screwed everything up by not letting her become homeless in Winnipeg. 

Her husband is pissed off with me for interfering with a kid that I'm not related to. I can understand where they are coming from but I think they are not doing the right thing. I just want my son to know she is in a safe place. I also think she will go back to school once she figures out how much it sucks only having a high school diploma. 

I didn't know where to add this but before any of you start calling me a pervert or anything, please know that to the best of my knowledge she isn't into people with a Y chromosome. And I'm not into girls young enough to be my daughter.

I knew I forgot something. Her mom and dad's family are all in Alberta. And she doesn't want to move there.",0
"I’m a grad student, and I live in a 3 bed all female house. I share a bathroom and bedroom wall with one roommate (call her Shelly), the other (Ashley) has a master suite across the hall. Shelly started a new job at the end of January, and after a week of work, she brought a male coworker home . Cool, not a problem. However, a week later, he was still here. He never left. She never said anything to me or Ashley. I didnt see him myself until after he’d already been here for a few nights, and he was open carrying in the house when I first met him.

So after a week, I asked her how long he was staying for. She said his truck wasn’t working, so he was staying with her. She asked if he could just stay until the end of that week, so I said sure, but no longer. 

This past Sunday made it two weeks, and he was still here. Because she works nights and gets home with him in the morning, I’ve had to listen to their hookups while I’m getting ready for the day on multiple occasions. I told her he needed to be gone by Monday. She said she would take him home.

She didn’t. She texted Ashley to ask if he could stay. Ashley has been busy and not home much, so she had no idea he had been staying for two weeks. After I told her he had, she was uncomfortable with the situation as well. She knew information I didn’t, and told me that he is divorced, has three kids and ex military. I don’t know how she knew this information, I forgot to ask. 

So I told Shelly that he was no longer welcome here at any time. I sent an email to the leasing office. She is now very upset with me, saying I was being rude to her new boyfriend, who is “the best gentleman.” Because of this guy, I’m uncomfortable staying in my home for the night with her angry, and I’ve checked into a hotel. I feel like I’m being dramatic, but I’m worried for my own personal safety. 

UPDATE: The leasing office told me that there’s nothing they can do, so if anyone has any suggestions, I’m all ears. ",0
"I'm a 16 year old girl, and I live with my parents and my two older brothers.

A couple of months ago, I decided I needed to gain some weight. I am technically underweight and honestly I didn't really like the way I looked or felt. I found a bunch of ways to add some more calories into my diet, and one of those was actually eating breakfast. In the past I rarely ate breakfast, and I never ate a breakfast that was a whole meal.

So I started cooking myself breakfast every day. Not only is it delicious and helps me gain weight, but I also enjoying relaxing in the morning by cooking something. I make a lot of different things, but to give you an idea, this past week I've made waffles, breakfast burritos, egg sandwiches, and oatmeal.

When I first started cooking breakfast, my parents and brothers (who work from home at the moment) asked me if I could make some for them too. I said sure because I was already cooking so it didn't bother me. Since then I've been making five portions of breakfast every morning, and everyone has been enjoying it. And I've gained five pounds!

About a week ago though, my parents and my oldest brother went on sort of a health kick. They decided they wanted to eat healthier and cut down on how much fat and sugar they were eating. That's not really what I need personally, but whatever, I don't care what they eat. They decided to swap out sugar with Stevia, buy these healthy yogurts with no sugar, and swap out butter with margarine. They also decided that they wouldn't cook with fats anymore, they would just use Pam.

My other brother and I don't follow any of these things. Personally I think I'm healthy enough, and the amount of sugar and butter I eat isn't going to kill me. So I still put sugar and butter into breakfast and cook with butter or oil too.

Yesterday, we were all eating breakfast, and my dad asked me what was in the waffles, so I told him flour, butter, sugar, etc. He seemed surprised and asked why I didn't just use the Stevia and margarine. I told him because I don't really like them and I'm trying to gain weight, so using low calorie alternatives doesn't seem like the best idea. Then my dad asked me if I could just switch to Pam when I cooked stuff, to reduce the calories a little. I told him absolutely not.

Since then, my mom and other brother have tried convincing me. I've told them no several times, and now they're angry that I won't compromise. I told them if they wanted to use their low calories stuff, they could cook themselves. They think I'm being inconsiderate of their health and that I'm just being rude. My dad even went so far as to threaten to stop buying sugar and butter if I wouldn't be more considerate of them. I think that if I do compromise, eventually they'll ask me to swap out more and more stuff until I'm barely eating more than before. AITA?",0
"I’m very mad about this cause it made my mom upset and more stressed than she already is. We cooked chicken fajitas with green peppers and diced tomatoes, the chicken we had gotten from the food bank because of our financial situation. We make it though and it’s actually pretty good, I’ve definitely had better chicken but I could definitely eat it and so could my mother. We took it out to my dad and he complained it was a too big to eat and he has no teeth so I understood that and my mom cut it up, I took it back and he complained he didn’t want it and it wasn’t good unless he got tomato, lettuce and sour cream. 

He had no tomato but my mom chopped up lettuce and we had sour cream, her food got cold doing this and I didn’t sit down eating, only standing up doing all the delivery. I bring out the sour cream and lettuce and he like shoos it away and says, “It f***ing sucks I’m just forcing it down!” I’m frustrated and leave and scarf down the lettuce with seconds so it’s not wasted.  I tell my mom and her and I get so frustrated at the way he’s acting, he comes out and says it sucks and never to get that chicken again from the food bank and throws away the food.

Later I’m peeling oranges for him and he wants to make a chicken salad, he grabs the fajita leftovers and opens it and it had canned diced tomatoes and green chilies in it and he goes, “Wtf is in the chicken I wanted to make chicken salad! It’s going in the trash!” And he tosses it to the side to throw it away later. I step up and say there is no need to waste food and that I would eat it. Then he starts complaining that he has to make himself a corn dog for dinner.

Now I understand that you like what you like and sometimes you don’t like what people make, it’s fine but the problem I have is that he was so rude and mean about that making my mom stressed out and I’m not sure but on the point of tears with all his medical problems and her bad job.

I talked to my boyfriend about that and he agreed it was rude and that he knew his parents would never do that to each other no matter if they liked the food they make or not, I’d never do that to my mom or boyfriend and he said he would never talk to me like that. He’s mad my dad is like this and said to me, “At this point if your dad is gonna act like this, your mom and you should just stop cooking for him and let him cook for himself.” I agree with him, but I feel like it would lead to problems. I’m moving out soon, but until then I do not want to cook for him at all.",0
"My university library is 24/7. I was near the window, and two guys tapped on the window and asked me to open the door. He pointed to a back door, which I thought was the library door that doesn’t open after a certain time. I pointed to the front, indicating that that entrance opens after a certain time. They left and entered through that way. When he came inside, he came up to me and asked me “what my problem is” and why i didnt open the door for him. I told him that “i’m sorry, i didnt know that there was a back door for the building truthfully that still opens.” He then insulted me and said “its crazy your in university and don’t know where the door is.” And walked away. Honestly at this point I was fuming, and when I went to fill up my water bottle that was near his table, I asked him why he came up to me and spoke to me in such a rude and disrespectful way, and that I even apologized and didn’t know where the door was. He then told me “at your age, someone should know how to read situations,” (talking about the hand motioning he was making) even though I couldn’t hear him through the window and apologized as well. I told him he is an idiot and that if he spoke like that to the wrong guy he would get socked.

                           Part 1 on my acc

After that, my best friend’s mom called my mom and twisted the story and said that I was rude and that I should not be saying rude stuff about an adult and that she never was raised to disrespect people’s parents. And my mom took that as a friend and said that my best friend’s mom was blaming her for the whole situation even though she had nearly nothing to do with it. 
 
 
She got mad at me and started saying that adults were better than children, that children should listen to everything adults tell them to do, and that they have no say. So I got in pretty big trouble for doing that. As if that wasn’t already bad enough, my best friend’s mom called the dean of our school and told her about everything that happened so I got called into her office in the middle of class. Me and my best friend were banned from contacting each other on the phone anymore and since that happened I had to talk to her about the whole situation at school. But the thing is I got in trouble by the dean of our school for bringing the entire situation to the school even though we have literally no way of talking to each other about the situation except there. And we literally weren’t able to talk about the situation through text and we could talk about everything else but that. Because talking about the situation through text my best friend will get her phone taken away since her mom reads through all of her messages sometimes.
 
 
I almost got a big blue paper that makes you sign everything that you did wrong on it called a school violation. Those can get you in pretty big trouble with your parents since it’s talking about how you were being bad at school and having a teacher take drastic measures. The reason why I almost got that paper in the first place is that I got questioned if I was saying bad stuff about my best friend's mom and I admitted to it but I gave reasoning.  balled my eyes out in the school bathroom about three minutes after I got back in class from the Dean’s office.
 
 
I'm really starting to wonder if I’m in the wrong here for what I did but it was all just payback for the stuff that was done to me at first. Literally, nobody is standing by my side except my second best friend who also helped write the document but she barely wrote anything so she go in less trouble than me. And I feel powerless and betrayed. AITA?",0
"My mom died when I was 7. My dad met someone else 2yrs later, let’s call her C, and 2yrs after that they got married. When they were dating she seemed great. After she and my dad got engaged, her sweetness abruptly stopped.

Her 1st son, J, was born 11mo later. He shared my room. I was 11. I took on feedings, diaper changes, etc. When I came home from school, C would hand me J and storm out of the house. When I babysat, C scheduled dates at the same time & made me cancel so I could babysit J&X (next bro) for free. I kept money in a shoebox under my bed, about $300. I mentioned this to her, and soon $40 went missing. I thought it was my big brother. C screamed that it was irresponsible to keep it under my bed and it was my fault the $$ was gone because it should have been in a bank. 

At 14 I started working. With my consent, C transferred $100 a week from my bank account to “reimburse”  what they invested for me to learn a sport: $10,000. I later learned she never told my dad she was taking the money. She did this for 3yrs - over $15,000 - and fostered resentment in my dad over the $10,000. She ran up debt and pinned the blame for financial strain on me. 

When me and my full siblings went to college, we each had about $40k in 529s from my mom. All three of us received full military scholarships. I discerned out of the military, & said I wanted to use my 40k instead. I had a full ride my first year & it was enough to cover 3yrs of tuition. I was bullied & ostracized for using the money. I covered room & board working odd jobs. I scraped $500 a month: $400 to cover a bedroom & $3/day for food. Once I called home and asked C for a 1wk loan to help cover rent. She screamed that I was an entitled communist. When I came home, all of my stuff had been boxed & put in the attic, my childhood bed sold, etc.

She told my full sibs that they would get half of the $80k in their accounts. C asked if the other $40k could roll down to J & X for their college. C spent the money on a down payment for a lake house instead.

Eventually I was very angry and depressed. I would have explosive episodes and call C selfish. She would dissolve into tears - full on wailing - and call everyone she knew. This went on for years, until I finally got help and the explosive episodes stopped. It also helped to get wealthy. C is now much nicer to me.

C felt that I had a “target” on her for “years.” She has never admitted that she stole at least $50k from us. I maintain a truce only bc I want to have a relationship with my dad. 

Now J is in his 20s and is pissed at me for “the way I treated mom all these years” and said that I’m a “malignant narcissist.” C feels that she was victimized by me and J is justified in sending hate texts. I’m freezing J out. C thinks I need to “be patient and work through things” with J just like she “did with me.” But I have a job, a family & my own mental health to manage. I’m ready to just shut him out. I also do not feel bad about the things I said to C.

"My 28M sister Katie 30F recently got engaged to her partner of 7 years. They haven't set up date but are planning for something around Fall 24 or Spring/summer 25. For background, our mother passed away after years of health problems 6 years ago. Given how long she was sick, Im pretty sure our dad grieved her before she was officially gone. I think this is why he was able to move on quickly to his current wife Andrea. They got married 2 years after my mom died.

It was obviously weird at first for me to see our dad with someone else but she's honestly really cool and Ive never seen him so happy. Even before my mom was sick, I don't think they ever really had the chemistry he has with Andrea, he is literally always smiling when she's around. It took me some time to get used to Andrea being part of my family part now she's become an integral part of it and I'm so thankful she's taking a real grandmother role to my 2 kids, even if she's just related to them by marriage.

Katie was never able to get over seeing my dad move on and to this day won't aknoledge her as part of our family. While she doesn't say rude things directly to her, she is very curt with her and honestly comes off super catty with her. Anyways, so with her being engaged and starting wedding planning, my dad who is well off has always said he'd pay for our weddings, he paid for most of mine and was willing to pay for all of Katie's. That is until Katie said she won't allow Andrea at her wedding as she thinks it's an insult to our mom. My dad has withdrawn his offer to pay for the wedding or attend unless his wife is invited.

Personally I find this 100% reasonable as Andrea has never even done anything wrong or bad to us. This isn't the case of an evil stepmother, it's just an adult not willing to let her father move on. Katie and her husband asked me to be a groomsman and for my son to be a ring bearer and daughter to be flower girl and originally I said yes, but now with all this drama, I just don't want to anymore. I feel like Id be enabling a grown woman being unnecessarily mean to Andrea for no reason, who at this point I 100% consider family. Ive gotten some mixed feedback from my friend group about this decision so Id be interested to hear from outsiders who don't know anyone involved.

&#x200B;

ETA: Im getting way more responses/questions than expected, so Im going to log off for a while and Ill check this later. Im pretty sure ive answered the main questions, but please respect that Im not going to respond to each and every question asking for little details. Its just too much.",0
"I (45F) have been married to my husband (56M) since I was 18. I have a son 27M and a daughter 22F. 

We are not rich but decently well off. We always planned for our son to study abroad in a western country fo university since he was a child and this is expensive due to the high international tuition fees. This went as planned for my son.

However ever since I got a laptop and phone with Internet, I have used it to learn new things on my own from sources like MIT courseware and youtube and I really wanted my daughter to be an educated woman. I also stopped believing in my religion while my husband is devout. I pretend to be religious and follow our customs for the sake of the marriage. I only have high school level education.

The plan for my daughter was to find a boy from a nice family for her to marry, and not go to university or to go to a local one if she wanted to.

I convinced my husband that these days boys from good families want an educated woman for status reasons even if she does not work and that if our daughter had a western degree she could marry into an elite family. It worked and he paid for her to attend a top university which she got into which is actually better than the one my son went to.

My daughter after leaving also confided to me that she does not believe our religion anymore and started living a different lifestyle, one I can never have. She recently graduated, got a work visa and stayed in the western country and has a good job there.

My husband got really angry when he heard and is feeling really cheated and blames me as I pursuaded him to pay for her education and let her go. He even found a picture of her online of a university competition she did where she won a prize and posed for a picture without head covering.

I am feeling a little guilty since it is his money that let her go to university and now we may not get to see her again. AITA?

Sorry for any mistakes, my English is not the best.",0
"Background info:  I am a manager at a pretty successful independent restaurant. I’ve worked there for the last twenty years, as a server then bartender then moving into management. Since it is a family business, there’s people who have known me since I was tiny. Some of these servers have been there since the beginning, and I’ve known them for 30 years.  A few years ago they fired the server manager based on poor job performance and after a few months I took over the position. 
One server in particular, let’s call her Patty, has been there for 30+ years. She’s been head server, helped run the restaurant, and very much cares about the business. However, she is loud and abrasive and bossy and has actually scared quite a few new employees away. 
This person and I have spent a lot of time together, planned many group outings together, helped each other outside of work, and had a ton of fun together. However, now I’m her boss and she is a b***h. I’ve tried talking to her, she’s been spoken to by HR and written up numerous times and her behavior does not change. At our last HR meeting she was told if she doesn’t stop telling everyone what to do and being rude, she would be suspended. That day was today. 
This last week I had numerous employees come to me with complaints. She also spoke to me numerous times this past week disrespectfully and extremely rudely. She’s made it clear she does not respect me professionally and thinks my predecessor (who was fired for being petty and nasty) did a better job. 
Keep in mind this is someone I’ve thought of as a friend for the past twenty years. She has many wonderful qualities and does so many wonderful things for people (examples- sees everyone’s aprons; brings in Easter baskets for some of the staff who don’t have moms, etc). I value our friendship and have respect for her as a person. 
I took the complaints and my observations to HR today and she was suspended. I’m responsible for my entire department of fifty or so people, and the majority of them feel bullied or belittled by her. Her defense is that she’s trying to uphold the standards of the business and that things are slipping. I’ve told her numerous times I appreciate her experience and knowledge and if she has concerns to please come to me about it, instead of bossing the rest of the employees around. She’s been warned numerous times that the next step was suspension. 
AITA for putting my friend in this position? One more strike and she’s fired- an employee of 35 years and a friend of more than 20. I pretty much pushed this suspension to happen. ",0

My late husband  ""Adam"" (M36) passed away a month ago. He had lung cancer and was terminal. 

I live in his house that he owned (still haven't done anything concerning inheritance) his brother lost his job and place and moved in with me a week ago. I gotta admit I wasn't too pleased to have him move in with me but I had no choice after I got talked into it by family and since we had the chance to help each other grieve.


Here's the situation, he started randomly walking into the bedroom and excusing it as ""needing to borrow"" something from Adam's closet. He wears his clothes and even started using his stuff (razor, laptop etc) he also got his hands on his piano which to me felt disrespectful because..Adam wouldn't want it touched or moved.


I try to have conversations with him about what's allowed/what's not but he'd throw the ""Would Adam want you to treat me like that?"" line at me. It made me feel frusrtrated. I seriously started contemplating telling him to leave.


Now the current conflict, I finally brought myself to open Adam's closet and found a box full of wrapped gifts. I read the piece of paper at the bottom and he wrote that he had got me a gift for next year's ocassions in advance since he knew he wouldn't be around much longer. I was absolutely stunned. I looked at the gifts but didn't open them. There was a gift for my birthday, valentine's, our wedding anniversary, christmas and so on... he said he wanted this gesture to also serve as a comforting method so I wouldn't feel so devastated since we know that grief gets tense during these times. I could not believe it. I mean, he was always this thoughtful but I never just knew that his thoughtfulness could reach this level. I was out yesterday, and when I return I found that my nephews had opened all the gifts and ruined them. I was appalled, my joy instantly faded. I had a huge argument with BIL but he said the kids were curious and that it was my fault for not concealing my stuff like I should. I told him he had 3 days to move out, he started ranting about how it's his brother's house and how I was ruining family relationships over ""few gifts"". MIL got involved and took his side saying he's grieving and this is his brother's house and that I'm acting unhinged.


Am I being too emotional? I wanted to feel his presence in his presents this upcoming year but I feel like it was ruined for me.",0
"I (25f) have a friend called Morgan (27f). Morgan and I have been drifting apart in recent years due to our differing opinions of how she handled a situation at our other friend’s (25f-Lucy) wedding in 2019. 

Lucy had asked Morgan to make some deserts and sweet treats for the reception and she agreed. This was the only food that was going to be at the reception other than cocktail sandwiches. They agreed on the price (for the sake of simplicity, let’s say £500 for all the baked goods- this isn't what they actually offered, it was much more) because when they organised this, Lucy and her partner were solely paying for the wedding. About 7 months before the wedding, Lucy’s parents offered to pay for the remaining fees which they took up. This meant they theoretically had more money to pay Morgan for the food she was making. This is how it looked on paper, but in reality, the money was swallowed up quickly by other fees and whatnot. I guess Morgan found out about the ‘extra money’ at the wedding and tried to ask Lucy for more but Lucy refused... because she literally didn't have it. Morgan wanted £2000 now instead of £500. So, she took the all baked goods and put them back in her truck and so no one had anything to eat for most of the reception. 

Lucy was obviously having a breakdown and her partner/the families of the married couple/all our friend group were trying to convince her to bring the food back in but she refused. Luckily, some people went and ordered a ton of pizzas, burgers, milkshakes, etc and the wedding was saved but it caused so much unnecessary stress.

I have sort of stopped talking to Morgan but she is vaguely in the friend group because she’s loosely related to Lucy and she’s been trying to ‘get over it’ because they see each other at family gatherings.

Anyway, I announced my engagement December and we’re getting married in August 2023. Everyone but Morgan is invited. I'm not trying to be a bitch, but she has shown herself to be very vindictive and calculated in her malicious actions since this wedding debacle and the last thing I want is her kicking off. We have a seperate group chat that Morgan is not in, but she knows I'm getting married and is upset that she's not invited.

She called me and asked why I couldn't invite her. I told her that 1) we're not friends- even before Lucy's wedding, we were more acquaintances and 2) her behaviour at and after Lucy's wedding has made me doubt her maturity and I want my day to be special. I know I can't prevent EVERYTHING from happening at my wedding but if I can remove one factor (someone who is known for being argumentaive and vindictive) for my own anxiety, then fine.

Now she's trying to convince Lucy to convince me to let her come. Morgan is super upset at me and my fiance.

"I(24M) recently found out I'm going to become a dad. I haven't spoken to my biological father in well over 2 years after a fall out and never really had a good relationship with him growing up.
When me and my partner posted our news to Facebook 1 received a congratulations message from him and thought that was the end of it. The next day I get a message demanding I pick up the phone when he calls to tell him he's going to be a grandad.

"I don’t even know where to begin with this. Last semester I had an amazing roommate and in the dorm he was an absolute blessing, he graduated and now I have a randomly assigned one to take his space. 

This new roommate of mine seemingly has no classes, he stays in the dorm all day and does not leave, he consumes nothing but Pizza, Chips and candy and it’s driving me fucking insane. He will leave his food trash everywhere on his side of the room and it causes the room to smell unbelievably bad. I don’t mind if someone is messy I’m not the cleanest person in the world but Jesus. 

He also stays up late anywhere from 3-4 am and he does this while constantly playing videogames and talking with online friends. I would not mind this as I was in Boy Scouts and used to talking at night but this is EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. He wakes up around 1-2 in the afternoon and I have to constantly be quiet in the room as I feel it would be rude if I was noisy and woke him up. I have tried talking to him about it but he is extremely anti social and shuts down in any conversation with me and cannot hold a conversation for more than a sentence it seems

I just want to know if I am TA for trying to mitigate these issues by talking and when that didn’t work I’m just thinking I will start being louder and do what he does when I try to sleep.",0
"I (F28) moved back to my parents house last year after getting out of a terrible relationship. We don’t get along well, my mother disapproves of many of my life choices and relationships.

Meanwhile, I have met someone else and we have been dating for 6 months now but I haven’t shared this with my parents and don’t feel comfortable doing so. 

We are traveling together next week and as I live at home I need to inform my parents that I will be leaving for a week. 

My mother is already grilling me regarding where I am going and with who, and guilt tripping me because I live at her house and she is my mother and entitled to know. She also feels she should know for my safety, in case something happens. 

I don’t pay rent, so I feel some accountability towards her. 

I plan on maintaining that I don’t want to share and keeping things private. WIBTA?


EDIT:
Okay, here is some extra info. 
- my friends know where I am going and so does my boyfriend’s family;
- I have been dating this person for 6 months but we have been co-workers in the past. This is not someone random that I don’t know at all;
- the decisions my mother doesn’t agree with are all of them — from my outfit choices, to the color I chose to dye my hair, to how I place silverware in the dishwasher, to mocking food allergies. She has unsolicited negative comments to add to about everything and this is why I don’t feel comfortable sharing my relationship (which is great!) with her;
- I would absolutely love to share my trip with them. I just know she will cast a shadow to it;
- my parents do not accept rent from me. I do pay for my food and anything that is consumed by me. My brother (M24) comes and goes as well and faces none of this. ATM he is living abroad and my parents support him;
- I have a great job. However, I live in a country where the average monthly salary is less than 1 month rent for a 1 bedroom apartment. The only people my age I know that were able to move out are double income couples;
- I am saving 70% of every paycheck towards buying a house. I also budget for traveling. Again, I live somewhere flooded by tourism where housing is not affordable to locals at all.

EDIT 2:
- I have shared with my father that I will be traveling from day x to day y and that they can reach me through WhatsApp. His reaction was a simple “okay”;
- I believe my mother is not asking for details out of concern. When I share the necessary details with her she will probe for more and more until she has enough info to pass judgement. I am assuming because it has happened in the past.",0
"So my roommate mines crypto currencies with about 6 different computers in his room. I don’t know how sleeps because of the noise but that’s not part of the issue here. Ever since he started the electricity bills have been going absolutely through the roof. They’ve increased by $150 a month. I’ve told him that I will not he paying part of the electricity bills and he must take into account of how much electricity he is contributing because of his new income source in crypto mining. We’ve called our electricity company and they said the mining contributed to a 53% increase. 

He said he still thinks we should pay equally all because he thinks that it’s hard to track how much electricity the crypto is causing — even though the provider said it’s 53%.

I have told him I will stop paying the bills and so have our other housemates until he contributes to his fair share.

"My sister (29) left her fiancé in 2023 who she’s been with for 10 years because she didn’t love him and cheated on him (they have 2 daughters together) and is now planning to marry someone she’s been dating for a month. She texted me (25f) and my younger sister (24) two days ago announcing that she filed for a marriage license to this guy who me and my younger sister don’t even know and she expects us to be happy for her. I immediately just told her she’s being dumb and she’s gonna ruin her life. She has two young daughters she needs to take care of but she’s more focused on finding a guy to be with. It’s really concerning to me and the rest of our family, our mom and dad have been telling her she needs to get her shit together but she’s just not. Anytime anyone tries to tell her she’s being an idiot she just laughs it off and acts like it’s not a big deal. She’s been dating random guys on and off and her living situation has been all over the place since she left her fiancé months ago. I just can’t deal with the way she’s been acting and I don’t want to come off as an a**hole but I just can’t with it anymore I’ve stopped texting her back. She sent a picture of her ring at 2am this morning and I haven’t responded. I know for a fact she thinks anyone who disagrees with her is being mean to her she would call me complaining about my mom and our younger sister for telling her she needs to figure her shit out and so I know she’s probably doing the same about me now. 

EDIT: Since a lot of y’all are wondering if she has any mental health issues- she suffers from anxiety and has had depression on and off for years. She’s taking antidepressants and seeing a therapist 

EDIT: This was the last straw for me that’s why I came off aggressive saying she’s dumb and gonna ruin her life because it’s been months of this back and fourth with different guys asking everyone in our family to help her with paying for stuff and then not saying thank you she also got into a car accident a little while ago because of drunk driving. This just seems like oh she’s happy right now with this guy so let’s get married. 

EDIT: She does not have sole custody of her kids like I said her living situation has been a mess she’s been hopping around from different peoples places for months her ex has them majority of the time she probably sees them once a week if that. She just recently got an apartment with this guy like a week ago.",0
"I, 29, hate debt. It's nothing but a weight around your ankles to keep you from moving ahead with your life. I was lucky enough to get scholarships for most of college, and paid off the loans I did have to get ASAP. I did go ahead and buy a new car for the increased safety features, but only have a few thousand left on that loan, because again, aggressive paying it off. I just bought a house because a mortgage is half of what my old apartment rent was, but I plan on being aggressive with this too, and hopefully have it paid off in a fraction of the time. Long story shit, I fucking hate debt. Makes me very anxious and feel physically sick. 

My gf, 29, on the other hand, has a ton of debt, and doesn't really care. She has student loans, her car, and her credit card, and is making the bare minimum payments so she has extra money to play with each month.

Because I do love her, and could theoretically see myself spending my life with her, I made her a deal - she could live in my house, rent, grocery, and utility free, until her debts were all paid off. With her salary, it would take her about 1.5 years to pay it all off if she put the max amount she could towards them. It would then become our house, and she would help take half of the payments so we could be on a more equal footing. She accepted this without question, and we even sat down to look over her finances, budget, pay stubs, everything, so we could make a comprehensive plan. 

Well, the other day her cell rang while she was in the shower, so I picked it up. Turns out, it's a debt collector! I confronted her about this when she got out and dressed, since it's been a few months and she should have been able to pay off at least the smallest loan in full, and it turns out she just stopped paying everything! Let everything go into default, since ""You'll just pay it when we're married."" 

I then made it _very_ clear that we werent getting married anytime soon, not until her debt was gone, and she knows my stance on keeping long term debt. This upset her, she started yelling at me, and I made it very clear she had three options - follow our deal and pay off her debt, pay me back for the last few months I've apparently funded her lifestyle, or leave and go stay with her brother. Huffy, she packed a bag and left, saying we'd talk about this later when I'd ""calmed down."" I made it clear there was nothing to talk about, and I'd have her stuff packed by morning. 

The last few hours, however, her entire family's called, our mutual friends have called, everyone's called to put in their two cents on how I was being too controlling with her money. I see it as her being a freeloader, especially since she knows my anxieties around being in large amounts of debt (parents lost everything in '08, we were homeless for a year, I refuse to do that again). AITA here?

Edit: Thanks for the silver, whoever you are! And damn, this blew up. I posted right before I crashed last night, so I'll read and responde to people soon.

Edit 2: And a gold?! Shit guys, I'm honored. Thank you very much!

Update: I've got some friends coming over after work to help me take the rest of her stuff over to her brother's house. Been a long night, full of phone calls and people yelling at me and a long voice mail of her crying, but after reading what yall said, this is the right call. I want someone who loves me, not my money. Thanks yall, and good luck to everyone out there. Stay safe!",0
"I have 2 twins, castella and freya with my ex wife.  
My ex wife Mariana and I were married for a long time, we divorced a while ago and I remarried 2 years ago. 

My wife Ava does not like my ex. I told her from the beginning me and my ex wife are not rivals, we are co parents and civil and she’s regardless she’s their mom. My parents like her a lot, Mariana was diagnosed with cancer last year her head is shaved as she is still on chemo and my parents have been helping her with herself and the kids often. 

they are my kids grandparents and I don’t see why I have to shun Mariana out of everyone she’s been around since grade school.  

I don’t talk to her aside from the kids, she doesn’t come to family gatherings or anything. There’s many things Ava doesn’t like about this. Especially our custody agreement. 

Here’s the issue, my kids came to me really upset and they showed me a bunch of posts that Ava made about Mariana. 

Ava for the past *months* has been writing posts about Mariana. She’s taken a picture of her from her profiles, one of her in a wig after she shaved her hair saying “take off the f-ing wig” another picture of Mariana with no wig on saying “that’s better b**tch, she took another one of whag mariana posted of her and the kids on their birthdays saying “so happy to see my babies getting so big” to which Ava reposted saying “yeah your still dying tho” these got worse even people Ava was friends with were posting about Mariana AND our kids. 

My kids are upset, we all sat down and she tried saying that Mariana was messaging her saying way worse stuff, I asked her to show me, but she said that it’s on Snapchat and they are gone, (It was confirmed that Mariana doesn’t even have Snapchat) 

I told Ava that she needed to go for a little while me and my kids talked. They said that they found her on Instagram and this has been happening since she’s got cancer based on how long she’s been posting these, they were obviously hurt, they said that they wanted to go to their moms for a little while and this made them extremely uncomfortable with her which was understandable.

Me and mariana talked, apparently she’s seen this but didn’t bring it up because she wasn’t in the mood to cause any drama.

Me and Ava talked, I told her that she’s going to publicly apologize to Mariana and my kids since everything was made public, apologize to Mariana through text and my kids in person. I left for a bit to think. 

All of this embarrassed Ava greatly. 

I’m getting messages from people saying that I’m an asshole and I made her do all of that and didn’t even forgive her, and humiliated her.

I think that it’s odd to accuse me of that, theres a line between caring about someone’s well being and being secretly in love with them and if I was highly doubt I would be divorced and married for this long. And I feel like embarrassment was deserved, I hate to say it but this just made me disgusted.

**edit/update**. i see a lot of people asking if I’m going to stay, I have to choose etc. I found this out on Saturday, made this post last night in a hotel, I hope people can understand that this was shocking to hear and see and I am trying to handle this appropriately and maturely. No that’s not me playing the victim, i know that I’m not and the only victims here are Mariana and my kids, but this is still difficult. I can tell this will be a messy divorce and I’m trying to prepare myself for that. It’s clear she will not be so mature about this.

Truthfully I knew what had to be done when my kids left because they couldn’t be around her. I do care about my kids and Mariana and their opinion on anything. I was naive and blind to the type of person Ava was and that’s my fault and I’m trying to fix that. This is grounds for divorce. As I’ve said previously me Mariana and my kids are meeting up today as I’ve also said, that is not going to change me divorcing Ava, this is strictly so I can get the full truth because I won’t get that from Ava, it’s looks like I’ve made everyone feel like they can’t tell me when they don’t like someone I’m with which was never my intention and I hope today and what I do next can prove that. I have alot of care and respect for Mariana and I haven’t showed that but i do and no one has to convince me to choose my kids over anyone I will always choose my kids and It’s my fault for not showing that. 

As for Ava, I’m not really sure what I’m going to do next, well divorce obviously, but as for right now I guess I’m going to be staying at the hotel until I can get everything situated and lawyers. I don’t know why she has done what she’s done besides jealousy. I haven’t answered any of her calls or texts,really just her cussing me out. 

I’m trying to work through this, I’m not a malicious person, I didn’t mean to hurt anyone especially not my kids and I’m trying to make this right. Overall yes I’m looking at lawyers and divorce, and I am going to be talking to everyone today, I will try to update.",0
"I was at the rental car place waiting in line to return my car and minding my own business.  There are 2 very short lines at the service counter (with like 2 customers each). These two gen z girls were standing in the line next to me, and we were both next in line to be served with a wait time of ~1-2 min.  But the guy in front of me was moving slightly faster. suddenly they come up to me and demand to cut in front of me in my line because they “were here for longer”. They start yelling and screaming at me that they “have to get to class” and eventually start screaming swears like “fuck you”. I told them to calm down, and that they are being drama queens in front of the whole store for no reason. They shut up and continued muttering mean things about me under their breath.

Then the rental car people just silently motioned for me to come forward to process my return, while the 2 girls were left fuming behind me. 

When there are 2 lines, can someone from the other line just suddenly demand to cut in front of you, and am I an asshole for saying no? 

And why are gen z girls the most entitled brats I’ve ever met?

"My mom’s little brother Alex (he’s 14) is moving in with us. I don’t really mind or care as there’s literally nowhere else for him to go right now but they want me (17f) to share a room with him. 

We have 3 rooms, mom and dad’s room, my room, and a room in the basement. No one uses that room so I assumed that’s where he’d be sleeping. But mom said no because Alex is scared of the dark and that specific room has no light. I told her to buy him a lamp but she got mad and said he’s not sleeping in the basement. 

I asked her why, he’s 14, not 4. She just said that I’m being very difficult and he’s just going to sleep in there so I need to get over it. 

I really don’t want to share a room with a 14 year old boy and plus I have my boyfriend over a lot. Also I don’t even know him and we’ve never met before either.

It got really bad the night before Alex came. Mom kept talking about where they’d put the mattress as if it was already decided so I told her again that I really don’t want him sleeping in my room. She looked angrier than usual and told me that she’ll make me sleep in the room in the basement and give him my room if I don’t learn to cooperate. I told her that I don’t care, I’m not going to let him into my room. Then I went to my room and locked the door. Some time later her and my dad asked me to open the door so they could put the mattress in but I refused. Mom got really mad again and said I’m being extremely selfish. I told her I didn’t care.

I did the same thing tonight even though Alex was here as well and mom isn’t talking to me anymore. Dad said he’s really disappointed in me as well but I think he’s just mad because they had to put the mattress in their room and that’s where Alex slept. I refuse to budge on this though I do feel a little bad. Still, he can totally sleep in the basement, they’re making it difficult for themselves. AITA?",0
"This happened on my recent flight back from Greece and I may honestly be the AH in this situation so decided to post here. I'm not a particularly tall person, I stand at around 5'9 but still find it uncomfortable sitting on planes due to the quite often extremely restricted leg room. For this reason I always decide to pay extra to ensure I get the exit row seat and the extra legroom. 

Once I got comfortable and had shut my eyes with my earphones in I am tapped on the shoulder by a man I would say to be around 6'2. He asked if I would switch seats with him as I dont need the extra legroom as much as him. I explained that I paid extra for this seat and therefore am not willing to move. He scoffs at me and goes to get a flight attendant. Now this is where I could potentially be an AH, the flight attendant asks again if I'm willing to move, when I say no again she explains that she will be able to put a request in to refund the additional amount I paid. I denied once more and explained that if he wanted the extra room so badly he should have paid in the first place, plus he is at max only 4 inches taller than me. He kicks off and calls me an entitled AH, which I thought was rather ironic, but anyway...was I the AH in this situation?",0
"My family have always had this tradition where the first child born after the loss of someone in the family gets the late family member's name as their middle name. My sister and I both have those middle names. Hers is Patricia after a cousin of our mom's and mine is Denise after my dad's aunt.

Almost a year ago my sister lost her 2 day old son, Philip. He was the last family member we lost and it was a huge, earth shattering blow for our family.

I found out I was pregnant a few months ago. I waited a while to tell anyone and my sister was the first person we told, privately. When I told her she said it would be nice to have some positive news to focus on and she wanted me to continue the tradition our family keeps and give my baby, if a boy, the middle name Philip. She was so happy about the idea. It surprised me a lot. I would have figured she would not be okay with it. But she wanted it.

The problem is my husband and I do not want to continue with the tradition. We do not want to give our son the middle name Philip. The name isn't one either of us likes or would ever pick ourselves... We have not announced the sex of our baby yet but my husband and I know we are expecting a boy.

My family were saying how amazing it will be if my baby is a boy and Philip's name can be carried on... I suggested they wait until we announce the sex and the name before jumping to conclusions. They asked why and I said we were thinking of not continuing with the tradition. My family, and by that I mean my parents mostly, were really upset. My sister was the worst though. She asked why I wouldn't want to honor Philip and why it was him the tradition was getting broken on. She asked if I saw him as meaning so little and I said no, of course not. Then she asked if it was his name and we didn't like it. She said she really hoped it wasn't that. I said we just didn't feel like the tradition was something we wanted to continue.

The decision has brought up a lot of bad feelings and my sister is especially angry and thinks I'm being insensitive and showing how little I care for my nephew. I feel terrible. She's so angry at me and my parents are unhappy as well. My husband hates them for putting this pressure on us. He said we should be allowed to name our son what we want and we should not be obliged to use a certain name. I never wanted to be an asshole but my family believes I am.

"Hey Reddit, I need your help to settle a disagreement between me and my partner. This morning, I heard noise in the kitchen and assumed that the service person had arrived. I went to ask them to prepare my breakfast, but I found that they were there talking to my girlfriend.

I waited for a moment to ask them to prepare my breakfast, but they didn't give me a chance. After a while, I tried to interrupt and quickly said, ""Can you please prepare my breakfast, [service person's name]?"" and then I left.

Later, my partner came to our room and told me that I was a desconsiderate for interrupting their conversation. She said that I should have left and come back when they finished talking.

I understand that interrupting a conversation is not polite, but I was hungry and wanted to ask for my breakfast. I didn't want to wait for them to finish talking because I thought it would take too long.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for interrupting their conversation to ask for breakfast? Or was it a reasonable request given the circumstances? I appreciate your honest opinions.",0
"I (19F) started working at my current job last year. I have a coworker called Lucy (21F) and she's the coworker who I'm closest too. We spend our short lunch breaks together. I started to notice that Lucy never brought food for lunch. One day I offered to share my food with her. She took that as a sign to start being able to eat my food.  She would take things from My lunchbox while we were talking and I was eating.  I let her continue until I became tired of it. I told her to stop because this was my food. 
She told me that she didn't have money to buy food and the food that she took was the only food she would eat in a day. 
I told her that it was her problem.
She said that if we couldn't share, then I should make her a lunchbox every day.  I said no way. She's a grown ass woman and I shouldn't have to make her food every single day. She hasn't spoken to me since.  
Everyone thinks I'm being to hard on her and that i should   make her lunch but I don't want to and don't feel I should have to.",0
"Last week I had a group presentation and after we were done my team mates and I decided to go out for lunch. Then one of them asked if one of her friends could come with us. We’re all international students. 

So we’re waiting for her friend, she shows up and we go to eat at this restaurant near campus.

During lunch, she gets a call from her mum. And she starts speaking on the phone in French. 

At first it was normal stuff but then it became “these people brought me to this restaurant and I hate the food”, “This place isn’t even nice why did they come here” and “these people are so boring” etc. 

I was very uncomfortable by the end of it. Afterwards, I told my teammate (the girl’s friend) about what was said. She was angry and apologised to me and told me this wasn’t the first time something like this has happened. 

Apparently they usually speak to each other in Arabic but her friend switches to French if she wants to say something to someone that she doesn’t want my teammate to know about. 

Later that night I get a bunch of DM requests from my teammate’s friend. She was like “it was rude of me to sit there and listen to her private conversation and I should’ve excused myself and gone somewhere else”

Then there was “you lied to me about where you’re from, you made me think I could have a private conversation around you” 

Okay, so, my dad is Korean and my mum is Swiss. We talked about this over lunch. She asked me what part of Switzerland my family is from. I said my mum’s family is from around Zurich. Because of this, she thought I could only speak German.

This is how I “lied” about where I’m from. 
She told me that she’ll apologise about the things she’s said if I acknowledge I’ve “purposely deceived her” as well. 

I just ignored her after that.",0
"I (22m) and my girlfriend (25f) have been dating long distance for six months now and have just very recently had our six months celebration. Where she came and visited Me from London where I made a candle lit dinner. I'm currently in my final year of university and Im trying to get a major part of my dissertation finished to reduce the stress I have for it. I've also been getting more hours at work to help me save up so I can move out of my current living situation. My girlfriend knows all this since she's the one whos been helping me out with my financial situation (she used to work in accounting). However she's mad at me for telling her I don't feel comfortable with her coming up to see me this week since it's such a busy week since I have work all week as well as university work. She knows all this is happening since I told her the week before when I saw her for our anniversary. She tells me that she's not bothered about that however she's had a stressful week and wants to see me to relax, I've told her that I again don't feel like I'll be able to provide that support since all I'll be doing is work and university work. She's then telling me that I'm not being supportive and that I'm being selfish because I'm not willing to show up and if something down the line more important would to happen then would I be able to make it. I don't feel like that's true since we had agreed that this week coming up will be hectic and I had the assumption that we both agreed this was a long week for me. Since I had told her several times and she accord it would be busy. Idk if I'm being a twat or not I just feel like it was very sudden? Like the day before we weren't even talking about it and now all of a sudden she was making plans to see me without me even know. Also I feel like another thing is I'll be the one buying the tickets, what I wouldn't mind but again I'm trying to follow a budget and I don't want to exceed it. Again I don't know if this makes me an arsehole amd I being selfish? I would appreciate any replies be as honest as you can. Thank you :)",0
"This is my first time using this subreddit, so I apologize for any wrong formatting, I am still a teeny bit confused

So I, (25, f but id's as non binary) live at home with my grandmother, mother and two younger brothers, my step-father lives in another state as he is in the army. We are Filipinos, so our culture is very family oriented and heavy on respect.

I am a college student, trying to finish my degree and everything so I can get a job and hopefully move out someday. As I feel like it's hard to live at home. I am currently unemployeed but I do help around the house. I struggle with ADHD and Bipolar disorder. So I am normally somebody who gets distracted easily, but I work on it.

My grandmother (60s) is very strict. She grew up in the 1950s in the Philippines, so we are in two completely different times in our lives and also in two different countries with cultural norms, etc.

We butt heads often. She gets mad really easily and when things don't go how she wants them, she starts calling me an idiot or any other type of name calling. It has really f#cked with my anxiety, but I try so hard to just suck it up because that's how she is as a person and I don't think she can change. She also says I should have a PHD by now cause she had one at 21. She also tells me I won't go far in life, won't succeed, it's going to be easy for my brothers cause they're males  but not for me cause I'm a female (again, that 50s mentality)

Recently, this past Jan, I started going to campus and actually have three classes. Two on campus TTH (Tues and Thurs) and one online MW (Mon and Wed). My grandmother is the one who encouraged me to go to campus, so I did. However, she's the one home when my mom is at work and my brothers are at school. So she does most of the work when I'm not able to help her.

&#x200B;

When I get home, I'm obviously tired and need to rest for a few minutes, but any sign of me just needing to even rest, she gets mad. She tells me that I was out all day and she was the one who cooked, cleaned and everything. It just feels unfair because I was at school. It wasn't like I went out to the mall and stayed out the entire day. I was at school from 8am to nearly 3pm. She's also the one who encouraged me to go to school on campus. Even said that I should try full time.

&#x200B;

This is another reason I am a little anxious on getting a job. Because in 2022, she told me to voulenteer at my mom's place of work, but when we got home, she was mad I wasn't there to help her?? Even though she suggested it?? Anyways....if she's mad that I'm out all day at *school* what more with *work?* it's getting so hard to be around her and I just feel like I cannot breathe

&#x200B;

Would I be the asshole if I tried to explain this? Because anytime I've tried, I've been told I'm disrespectful. I was even told by my mom that it's hard on her too (me being mentally ill) and anxious all the time.Anyways, thanks to anyone who responds

 I just feel like I would be an asshole cause she raised me w/ my mom

"I (26f) have been dating my boyfriend (Mark-30m) for a year and a half. He has 2 kids with his ex-wife (5m and 8m) who are the cutest things ever. He shares 50/50 custody and is on mostly good terms with his ex. The issue is that I don't want kids because of my own trauma, so when I made the decision to move in with my boyfriend, I took on the role of 'fun aunt'. Essentially, the figure I never had but needed in my life. I want to give that to the boys. In my mind, it's a way to have a relationship with the kids without impeding on their parents (who are both great). However, my choice has caused conflict between Mark and his ex. His ex thanked me. She said the boys love me and my 'vibe' and that I'm 'exactly what they need'. But Mark isn't so happy. He said I should be doing more to 'parent' them as I'm living with them and am the adult. For the record, I'm not a bad influence, I'm just more chill and like I've been saying this whole time, the 'fun aunt'.

AITA?

EDIT: forgot to mention, but I did talk to Mark about my role and he was fine with it, but now he's sort of changed his mind now that I live with him.

EDIT 2: Here are some examples: 

1) Mark and the boys like to go to the park on a sunday, but if they want a lazy sunday, we curl up and watch movies whilst Mark goes out biking.

2) I love to bake, and don't mind messes. They can be cleaned. If the kids want to help me ice a cake and get messy, I just clean them up. 

3) I go all out when reading bedtime stories. Voices, shadow puppets, everything. 5 specifically loves it. 

4) I'm not afraid to make a fool of myself for the boys. Mark is a great father, but can be very uptight and will refuse to play with the boys in the park. I'm the one who is running around making monster noises and chasing all the kids. 

5) I congratulate them on their achievements. Mark is one of those 'An A grade is expected, you will not be celebrated for getting what is expected of you' types. He's been getting better with it, but if one of the kids does good on a test or something, I hype them up. ",0
"I (28F) and my husband (32M) have a three year old son together. There has never been any doubt that my husband is the father. I've never given him any cause for concern that I cheated on him; he acknowledges all of this.

Last week, he came to me and said that for the last few months, he has been ""plagued"" (his word) with this anxiety that our son is not his. They don't look identical, granted, but they definitely share similar features and I see my husband whenever I look at my son. I was obviously blindsighted by this. I had no idea he was having these thoughts. I asked him to explain why he thought that he wasn't his and he couldn't really provide any answer other than ""a gut feeling."" He asked me if I would be okay if he got a paternity test done so it could ease his mind. I initially said absolutely not, no way in hell; I was very very offended. He told me that he could just do it without my permission and I said if he did that, I would never forgive him.

My husband does not have a history of anxiety but he did lose his job back at the start of the pandemic so he's been with our son most of the time while I work my full time job from home. I know this hasn't been easy on him. I'm not a psychiatrist or anything but maybe he is starting to resent our son or something from just having to be around him constantly. 

After our heated first conversation, I spoke with some friends about it, and they said that he was probably having psychiatric problems due to the stress of not having a job. I came back to my husband and said that if he went to therapy and maybe started taking some anti-anxiety meds, that I would consider getting the test. He was very upset at this and said that once he got the results of the test back, he wouldn't be anxious anymore and that I wasn't being fair by making him go through a whole ""rigmarole"" (again, his word) just to get ""peace of mind"", which was a phrase he used a lot during this. He again threatened to just get the test without my ""permission"" and I said this would effectively end our relationship.

I think there's something more serious going on here and I thought that my solution here is as fair as I'm willing to be. My friends are divided, some think I should just take the test and others are saying he's being insane and that if I cave to this, there's just going to be something else. I need some neutral perspective here. AITA?

Edit: I haven’t read all the comments here because the amount of responses has been overwhelming. However, I want to say that I really do not appreciate strangers attempting to diagnose my husband over the internet; it is disgustingly presumptuous. I’m his wife and I don’t feel qualified to do that, which is exactly why I want him to go to a LICENSED therapist. 

Another thing i’m seeing pop up is that i’m somehow demanding that he take medication. I said “maybe” medication, meaning that I only think he should be on medication if a LICENSED therapist prescribes them to him. I don’t want to shove pills down his throat, which seems to be what some people think I want to do. 

As for the numerous suggestions of marriage counseling as opposed to individual therapy, I think this is a great idea (I didn’t initially consider it because I was so focused on it being HIS problem but we are ultimately a team) and I’ll suggest that to him today. Hopefully, it goes better. Thanks everyone for your input.",0
"Due to the pandemic and the extra safety measures, the fertility clinic I own is having a pretty huge waitlist. We only recently reopened and things have been a little hectic. 

One of the nurses, N, has been with the clinic since it opened. She is now 5 months pregnant. She preferred to take her maternity leave towards the end of the pregnancy. Everyone are making sure that she has limited patient for her own safety. 

We have a couple (Jen and Jack) who have been clients for a long time. Sadly, most of their treatments and IVF's ended in failure. Few months ago, she had a stillborn and both of them were devestated. 

When the couple came in a few days ago, Jen saw N in the waiting room and started crying. After a few minutes, she started yelling at everyone about how insensitive we are. She yelled at N and she said some very very nasty stuff. 

End of the incident, we asked them to leave and dropped them as a client. The problem is that the waitlist these days are huge and it's very likely that their treatment will be halted for a few years (maybe more, considering that so many clinics are closed / operating at half capacity). 

Jack called requesting us to put them back on the waitlist but in the end we were firm about our policies. Jack pretty much iterated the same as Jen in the end - having a pregnant woman flaunting near women who are struggling with loss/struggling to conceive was an asshole move. 

Now, I am a little bit conflicted. It's not fair that some women have a lot of problem while others don't. However, it is pretty dumb to expect everyone working around infertility clinics to not work there if they are pregnant.

"I (30F) have two kids, ""Arthur"" (4M) and ""Lucy"" (7 months). When my son was a baby, my husband (32M) and I decided we wouldn't give our children any gadgets (phones, tablets or computers) until they were at least 9 years old.

I worked as a babysitter in my early 20s, and many of the kids I'd take care of were glued to iPads. Most of them had no social skills, refused to go out, and were absolute nightmares to be around when they didn't have a gadget with them. I don't like judging other parents, and I get how overwhelming children can be, but I refuse to raise mine like that.

My dad (63M) is dating ""Shelly"" (37F). Her sister had her third child earlier this year, and gave her older kids an iPad to distract them while she focused on the baby. My father and Shelly both thought that was a great idea.

Since Lucy was born, my father has been trying to convince me to get Arthur an iPad. He says that this would be a great way to keep him busy while I take care of the baby, and to make parenting ""less of a struggle"" for me and my husband.

We're not struggling. Things aren't perfect, but we're happy and healthy without iPads. Whenever I try to express that to my dad, he ignores me. I've been declining his advice all year. He finally stopped bringing it up about a month ago, and I thought it was over.

Last week, he and Shelly got back from a trip abroad. I went to their place to pick up some things I'd asked them to get, when I noticed an iPad box in one of their suitcases. Shelly confirmed they'd gotten it as a Christmas gift for Arthur. When my father tried to deny that, it became clear that they planned on giving it to him behind my back.

As calmly as I could, I said I didn't care who they gave that iPad to, but it wouldn't be Arthur. We ended up having a huge fight, and I told them my family wouldn't be attending Christmas (my aunt is hosting) unless they promised not to give Arthur the iPad.

Both my father and Shelly are furious. They're calling me ungrateful, and insist they're only trying to help me and my husband and we'd see that if we weren't so stubborn. My father is also angry that I'm denying Arthur an expensive gift that many people don't have access to.

Me and my husband aren't budging, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel like I'm overreacting. I also don't want to spend Lucy's first Christmas without the rest of my family, and when I think about that, this feels like an awful hill to die on.

"Hey there everyone.My partner (M29) and I (F29) have lived together for a bit, we took time apart for various reasons and now live separately but are working towards living together again.

Now, I live in my place, and he has lived in a different house with housemates for about seven months.The issue is that I don't feel like he cares about himself or cares for himself that much. He still needs a bed set. I've been letting him borrow some of my blankets and a pillow; otherwise, he ( and I when I visit) would sleep with a fitted bed sheet and a small throw blanket. He needs proper work clothes. He ripped his work clothes months ago and has them held together by duct tape (it's his only pair of work pants). He doesn't buy himself groceries but instead gets food from work or orders food, which costs more than just getting groceries. He only has two towels, and when I visit, sometimes they are both dirty, so we either have to wash them or I shower when I get home. Sometimes, when I visit two weeks later, he still has the same (unwashed) towel that he has then used as the only one I can use. Most of his underwear and socks have holes in them. And a few other things.

We both don't make much money, and I don't expect him to buy a ton of expensive stuff for himself. But I also know he can afford everything I'm talking about. Even if he bought one thing per paycheck, he could have had all these things quickly. I've bought things to help him out, but I also can't get everything for him. With us trying to work towards living together, all of these things really make me not want to live with him. I can't afford to care for two people entirely and I don't want to live like that. I honestly make less money than he does, and still, I have groceries, bedding, live in my own place, budget my money, and have a savings.

AITA for not wanting to live with him unless he's able to get all that stuff figured out, or am I just being a bit dramatic?",0
"I shared custody of my 2 children equally. I haven’t seen my youngest son for 4 weeks. A little backstory: my eldest child is homeschooled bc with an ADHD diagnosis and other stresses of school, it was in his best interests. He is now a happy child vastly different to what he was whilst in the school system. My ex and I share homeschooling. 

Understandably, my youngest also wants to be homeschooled. I have not agreed to this as he is a very bright boy and thrives in school. I feel the benefits of him being in school far outweigh the perceived negatives. My ex wants him to be homeschooled and has gone as far as trying to implement this without me. Because of this, my son has refused to see me for the last month. I have explained to him my reasons for why I don’t think he should be homeschooled but there is only so much a 11 year old could understand of the ramifications. 

My ex has now said he doesn’t want to come to mine at Christmas. We alternate these and it is my turn for Christmas Eve etc. My relationship with both my children is very close and it’s extremely upsetting going through this. My ex asked if I would be sending the gifts I have bought him to hers and when I said I wouldn’t, said I was unfair.

My reasoning is that as much as he might dislike my decision re homeschooling from which this all stems from, I would not teach him it is ok to treat me this way. I am a very involved, present parent, and it seems he doesn’t want to see me to cause me pain. As much as this hurts, I don’t feel I should give in, however long this takes. AITA?",0
"Teacher here. Our team is going through some changes and we have been down a teacher (there is a sub). My coworker is very stressed and doesn’t have someone to plan with. I have offered to help with what I can, but we don’t teach the same subject, so I can only do so much. She is type A to the extreme (OCD mixed with terrible anxiety— self proclaimed)and likes everything to be in order. I am Type B (solid teacher, I just don’t swear the small stuff) but we have always gotten along well enough and I considered ourselves to be good friends. Anyway, she was getting very heated and saying how she works every night until bed when she gets home and only spent 30 minutes with her family. I kindly (and I truly meant it kindly) said, “I say this with love. You need to set some boundaries with work. It shouldn’t take away from your family. The work will be here when you return.” 

She LOST it and started yelling at me and saying that I said the wrong thing, I crossed a line, she had to walk away because she couldn’t be around me. It really hurt my feelings and shocked me because it wasn’t my intention. I said again, “I wasn’t trying to be rude. I said it from my heart and I am just concerned about you.” Cue the additional hateful responses before storming off and leaving without so much as a goodbye. My other teammates were there and I think we were all stunned. The outburst honestly shocked me because I didn’t mean to offend.  I definitely hid in the bathroom and cried afterward. It wasn’t the words, but the way they were said was soooooo venomous like I had done something terrible. 

I get she’s busy and stressed, but we all are. I work full time, have two kids 4 & 2, and am getting my doctorate. I have to set work boundaries, and I don’t take my stress out on anyone. I feel like her stress got the better of her so she lashed out at me. I was in no way trying to be insensitive.

"I’ve been talking to a guy for roughly 2 months now, after a month we moved from messenger to Snapchat, NSFW photos were exchanged because yk why not. Fast forward to a week ago, I’m having a bad week but that ok because I can talk to let’s call him Connor (not his name or close to it dw), anyway this particular day I had to work really late, and I sent him a NSFW photo of me with my face in it which I usually don’t because I was tired and I’ll be honest a little tipsy, but I don’t send with my face for privacy reasons.  Sorry getting off track, he somehow without the Snapchat screenshot thing working had saved EVERY single photo including the one with my face, he put all of them on a black screen and sent it to group chats, his story, added me to a gc and sent it and sent it to me, for the next hour I was tormented by a mass of people on all platforms and it wouldn’t stop. I ended up blocking everyone except the Connor, I mess my friend Jess(again not her name) and told her the situation, she asked for his snap so she could mouth off at him so I gave it to her, keep in mind I’m on the floor of my bathroom crying in a ball and feeling so horrible that it made me physically sick, I literally threw up, but Jess posted on her story, hm maybe she’s talking about Connor guess what she was, but not in the way I’d hoped, she talked about  how much she likes him thinks he’s a good person and a good friend etc. I ignored it and went to bed but the day after I messaged her asking what was going on but she said yeah he did nothing wrong, oh by the way he told me he’s gay…. And that he led you on.


Now me and Jess have been friends for 3 years and gone through hell and back together. But I think I might drop her. This left me so upset I couldn’t leave my bed.. I yelled at her a lot on the phone and said it’s me or him..

"My partner started a long fast - like 6 weeks long - fast with no food or supplements -  only water. I'm worried about them and negative health impact. They do not have medical oversight for it and have not done any kind of prep. They just stopped eating.

They did this once before and though I was worried about it then, it seemed important to them and really only impacted them. Now I'm torn. Obviously it's their body and their choice, so maybe it's overstepping for me to weigh in. But now this choice also impacts the entire family - changed energy levels, limited social gatherings, family meal times, etc. I'm also worried about someone not eating for so long being able to responsibly care for children or drive them around - plus a little worried that it models disordered eating. AITH for asking them to stop doing it?  


ETA: Partner's response is that they want to do the fast and feel like my asking them to stop is not respecting their independence. Which I agree with to a certain extent - for instance I wouldn't make the ask if it was something more moderate like IF or I knew it was medically safe.",0
"So as a bit of backstory, I (24M) have been out as gay to my parents since I was 17. However, due to the fact that I was raised very religiously I was told to never date anyone and didn’t have a serious committed relationship until now. My boyfriend (26M) and I have been dating for 3 years now. After I told my parents that it was official, they said they didn’t want to meet my boyfriend and so they didn’t meet him until 3 months later.

For the next year my parents proceeded to have constant conversations with us about why they thought it was wrong and that they “hope it feels like my soul is being torn in half so I’ll come running back to God.” (Side note: my boyfriend and I are both still Christian so we don’t understand why they’re so insistent on telling us things like this) My father has surprisingly gotten better over time but my mom still makes comments about our relationship making her uncomfortable. They have told us since the beginning of our relationship that they didn’t want my father’s family to know as his family is all very religious.

Fast forward another 1.5 yrs, my brother got engaged recently to his gf of just over 1 yr and my parents are over the moon about it. My brothers fiancé is amazing and we love her. But now that his wedding is coming up I was told by my parents that I need to call my fathers family and come out to them prior to the wedding as it would ruin my brothers big day if they found out at the wedding. I told them I wasn’t comfortable doing that with people I speak to once every 5 years and my mother got mad saying I should think about my brother’s feelings.

So, I called my brother and asked him because if he genuinely wanted me to I would as I’m not trying to hide it, I just thought it would be an awkward conversation where I would be forced out. He said that he doesn’t care and that it’s more important to him that I’m there than people he rarely ever sees and if it becomes a problem he will ask the people causing a problem to leave. I told my mom he said I didn’t have to and she freaked out on me saying that I was inconsiderate and she knew what my brother wants and even if he said he doesn’t care I should do it out of respect to him and his fiancé.

AITA for not wanting to be forced out of the closet for my brother’s wedding to a bunch of people I don’t even talk to?

Edit 1: Just to clarify for people, the fiancé was also on the same phone call and said that she doesn’t care and doesn’t know why it matters so much.",0
"My BF (34) of 3 years just moved in to my (32F) 3 bedroom home 5 months ago. This home has been in my family for the past 70 years. I have a 5yo son. He has a 13yo daughter. I made sure I moved all of my stuff out of my office and put it in the loft so she could have her own bedroom. I think it was about a month in to him living here that his daughter wanted to move in with us full time- as she doesnt have her own bedroom at her moms. I was completely fine with this. 

Anyways, I started running in to a lot of problems not even a week after she moved in full time. She became really...entitled and demanding. Like demanding that my son trade rooms with her because it has a bigger closet and pitched a huge fit when I said no. Or demanding we buy her expensive clothes or makeup because I'm a real estate agent and I ""have loads of money"". Call me crazy but I'm not about to drop $120 on a pair of ripped up jeans or drop $200 on 3 pieces of makeup. Her dad works but his income is significantly less than mine so she really just expected me to be the one who spoils her rotten. Or pushing her plate of food away and saying ""I'm not eating that but you can cook me something else."" I can deal with her childish tantrums and slamming doors but she has now started to put holes in my walls and my BF makes excuses saying he used to do the same thing and she will grow out of it. She torments my son. If he says anything to her she literally ALWAYS responds with ""Oh you're talking to me? Swap rooms with me and I will think about responding."" Her dad literally never attempts to correct her behavior and I'm told I'm being too harsh if I do. 

The tip of the mountain for me here was 2 weeks ago there was a foul smell coming from her room so I asked her to clean it because you couldnt see the floor. She said ""Uhm no? It's my room so I dont see why you have any say on how I treat my personal space."" Her father actually agreed with her. 3 days later the smell had become so bad that I lost it. I told her to clean it or she was moving out. This was AFTER I saw at least 6 used menstrual pads thrown throughout her room as well as half eaten food and moldy drink cups. She starts crying and saying I'm treating her like she is Cinderella and I'm acting like an evil step mom. I told my BF either he handles it or they're both gone. He clearly didnt believe me because he told me that I needed to ""lighten the fuck up"" because his daughter is ""having a rough time transitioning and being away from her mom"". I gave it a week, nothing changed. I went and got an eviction notice drawn up and gave them 30 days to vacate my property and told him hes lucky I'm not suing for damages. He says I'm an AH for throwing away 3 years because I ""cant handle not having my own way"". AITA?",0
"I’ll start by saying that I love my wife to death. She’s the rock in our lives and she makes me very happy. She’s an amazing mom and wife.  There’s no one on this earth that I’d rather be married to. But she has a tendency to communicate in a  passive aggressive manner and we’ve had multiple conversations about it and she says she will try to be better. However, it continues on and on. 

For example… this morning I woke up, took the baby and played for an hour to let her sleep in, and then she came downstairs like usual. Then I went to clean something in the kitchen and left to go into the other room and she said “no coffee for me huh?”. (When I make coffee I always make us both coffees but I hadn’t made mine yet..) I explained that to her and a few minutes later made both coffees. Then I was tidying in the other room and she had the baby for maybe 5 minutes and I heard him fussing and she said loudly “oh I guess I’m the only one that takes care of you huh” to the baby. ??? I went over and grabbed him immediately but I told her “hey, you can just ask me to get the baby. I don’t need the passive aggressive stuff”. She was very displeased by this and said I’m being so evil and negative. Also said some other not nice things. 

Am I being gaslit here or AITA? If you need more info I’m happy to provide. But now I feel I can’t even tell her when she’s doing something wrong, I just have to take it.",0
"I (31F) was married to my amazing husband (34M) on Friday. The wedding went smoothly, apart from one guests dress preference, who we’ll call Anna. Anna’s mother sadly passed away in January this year. Her mother was the light of her life and ever since she passed, Anna has been understandably uptight and distant. I have helped Anna throughout her entire grieving time. We had been planning this wedding since December, and decided we wanted an ocean themed wedding. My family and I grew up on the seaside and have always been close to the ocean. I made it extremely clear to all of my bridesmaids that they were to wear blue, a coral pinky colour or pastel green. Everyone agreed and seemed to love my choices.

Anna’s mother always loved the colour dark, vibrant purple. Ever since then Anna would buy everything purple if there was a purple choice. Anna and me went for lunch a few weeks after the passing to catch up and support her. At the lunch, Anna asked me if she could please wear a purple dress to my wedding. I’m not crazy about themes usually, but since this wedding was themed to support my familys tradition and considering my maid of honour was already going to be wearing a GORGEOUS pastel blue dress with purple and gold accent’s, me and my husband who I decided to call and discuss the idea with him politely told her that we understand what she’s going through, but we really want bridesmaids on theme. To this she looked hurt, and left lunch earlier than expected. 

I hardly heard from Anna until around 4 weeks after our lunch, despite my attempts at texting, phoning and even knocking on her door, but she’d continue to shut me off. That was until she texted me “What do you think of these dresses?” And displayed many different purple dresses in photos. I kindly reminded Anna that she wouldn’t be wearing a purple dress to my wedding. Anna was enraged. I tried to tell her that I understand her feelings but my wedding is my own special day. To this she blocked me.

Anna unblocked me 2 days later, apologising for the way she acted. Well, when the wedding rolled around Anna showed up in a purple dress. I asked her why she had gone against my wishes and that she either had to change or leave. To this she told me to stop creating a scene and that I was being dramatic and disrespectful. Anna broke out in a screaming match and called me and my family “Insensitive, selfish bastards.” She was escorted out the door screaming.
Once the wedding had ended I recieves messages from Anna’s family, friends and even Anna. They were all saying how Anna was going through a lot and that I was being an asshole. So, AITA for not just letting Anna wear the damned purple dress?",0
"

My boyfriend, 27, and I, 26 have been together for 2 years. He's a good heart and is normally rational but his one issue is that he expects to accompany me in every ocassion nomatter how big or small. He even went with me to my ex boyfriend's funeral after days of begging. 

Now my best friend got married few days ago, it was very small and only close family and friends were invited, My boyfriend couldn't come because of the + one rule. He pitched a hissy fit saying my best friend has no respect for my relationship and was shocked when he learned that I was still going to attend, He told me that if he can't go then I'm expected to not go as well but that is my best friend and I had to respect her rules. He gave me an altimatum either we go together or I stay home with him. I ended up going cause again I respected my friend's rules. He was angry with me and kept calling the entire 2hr drive then stopped. Later I got a text from his friend telling me he (my boyfriend) got into an accident and was taken to the hospital. I freaked out he gave me the address and I had to leave the wedding and told my friends why. 

I was a crying the entire drive home and kept calling his friend but got no response. I arrived to the hospital and asked about my boyfriend and they checked and told me he wasn't there, My anxiety reached 160% as I kept calling his friends one by one. I just went home and there he was...along with his friend. He saw me and said that he was sorry but this was the only he can get me home after I left him alone. After the initial shock I just blew up yelling at him about lying and making me leave my friend's wedding and having me literally go to the hospital and freaking out cause of him. I kicked his friend out and we got into an argument. He kept talking about how much I love him thus I left which is my own doing not his and he was just trying to see if I really chose my friend's wedding over him. He then argued that my friend caused this and I shouldn't agree with her to exclude him, I said what he did was horrible and called him horrible and then went to my room. It was awful cause my friends kept calling to check in on him cause they thought he was really at the hospital. He said I overreacted and that I yelled at the wrong person.


AITA? Did I go too far?

"My mom (60F) was a stay at home mom all her life. When I was in my late teens my dad’s mom got sick and moved in with us. My mom HATED this and moaned about how my gran was being a burden and how my dad shouldn’t have moved her in without her consent. 

My gran died and a few years later my dad divorced her. I don’t hold it against my dad, she was horrible to him and horrible to my gran.

Anyway my mom got a single lump sum divorce payment 5 years ago. It was a big lump and she has been living pretty nicely for the last 5 years. 

But despite my advice she has now spent all the money. Last month she called my brother and I and asked us to pay her rent: which we did.

She is now telling us that she needs us to pay her rent (and her food and her bills and her entire living expenses) because she can’t work.

“Can’t” is a weird word. She does have some minor medical problems (back related) and says she can’t lift more than 10lbs. But the main thing is she just doesn’t want to. She’s says she will go insane if she has to do the same thing every day. She’s also said some negative things about “not flipping burgers”.

My mom has no formal qualifications (other than a high school diploma).

I really don’t want to pay her rent for the rest of my life. I have a stable income but it’s not huge $50k and I wanted to propose to my GF and maybe one day buy a house. Not take on a full time dependent. 

I know I’m not legally required to support her. But it feels SO wrong to just say “screw you” and let her be evicted. After all, she’s my mother.

Edit: to answer some questions.
1. Neither I nor my brother live with my mom. With both live in other states with our partners.
2. I am 30 and a woman.
3. My mom did not care for my gran. She refused to speak to her or enter “her side of the house”. To give you an idea of the severity - there was a tornado warning one day while I was at school. My mum took shelter. She left my gran bedridden on the other side of the house.

Edit 2:
My mom is not a widow. My dad is still alive.",0
"I, 28F, have been dating John, 29M, for about six months. We met Sarah, also 28, three weeks ago during Mardi Gras. Sarah, who goes by they/them pronouns, was visiting for a week and had bonded with John over a mutual friend they share in Germany. They became very close over the week Sarah lived here.

Fast forward to the day before Mardi Gras, John and I had planned to catch a parade together, as I had been busy most of Mardi Gras season and really wanted to spend time alone with him. However, on our way to the parade, John suggested picking up Sarah, despite my expressed desire to spend time just with him. I reluctantly agreed, understanding that it was Sarah’s first time here and they were traveling.

We ended up not going to the parade because Sarah felt too cold. Instead, we went back to their place and then to an event nearby. When the event turned out to be not enjoyable for me, we returned to Sarah’s place. While hanging out there, a guy walked in whom I recognized from a date I had when I was 17. We went on a date, and I hadn’t spoken to him in 11 years after an incident where he inappropriately touched me. I was uncomfortable and immediately told John I wanted to leave, as I had no idea this guy lived there.

The next day (mardi gras), John received a text from Sarah saying, “OMG, I have tea for you. Did you know Melissa (me) and Tom are exes?, did she even tell you?” This was not true, and I couldn’t understand why John was questioning whether this guy was my boyfriend or why he was upset with me for supposedly not disclosing this information and having him inside of Tom’s house. 

I had no idea Tom lived there and was only there because John wanted to hangout with Sarah. And I didn’t appreciate Sarah bringing up false information and asking John if I had told him about it. When I confronted Sarah about it, they shared my message with John, and he called me expressing disbelief and confusion, saying, “We didn’t do anything to you. We don’t understand why you’re mad at us.”

I feel like I’m being unfairly treated and misunderstood in this situation. I didn’t involve John in any of this, and I’m upset that he’s questioning me based on false information. I’m hurt that he’s taking Sarah’s side without even considering my perspective.

I think I could be the AH because instead of telling John why I wanted to leave right away I l decided I’d tell him after Mardi Gras. 

Am I the asshole for addressing this issue with Sarah and not being the one to tell my partner about Tom? ",0
"Update posted on my profile

My boyfriend Eric (29M, fake name) and I (27F) have been dating for three years. For context, I have met his family and they are friendly. We don't meet them very often because they live in my bf's home country. I don't want to reveal country names either for privacy reasons but my bf and I are of different nationalities and we both work in my country. 

The conflict happened during our last visit last weekend. We have been looking up houses to move in together and engagement rings. While we were having dinner, we mentioned this to his family as it's a big step in our relationship for us(we are not engaged yet.) His parents and brothers expressed their happiness for us then out of nowhere his youngest SIL asked ""So is she going to take the test?"" 

I asked ""what test?"".

 In summary, bf's family has this tradition where the future MIL tests future daughters-in-law to see if they are good enough for her sons. Apparently, his mother and aunts went through the same test. The tests include how clean they can keep a home, how well they can cook, their manners, etc. Basically life skills most people learn from childhood. I found it ridiculous because 1. If I'm good enough for my boyfriend, he should be the one deciding it. and 2. I don't fit in their targeted category. In his mom's words, you can't be a good SAHW and SAHM if you can't be a good homemaker and she wants to make sure of that. 

To be clear, his mom and all three of his brothers' wives are SAHMs and although I respect their choice, I am not quitting my career and did not under any circumstances make my bf think I could compromise on that. I hate house chores and I would rather buy homemaking gadgets and hire staff no matter the cost than have to do chores myself. I told my bf's mom all this and it caused an argument that eventually ruined dinner and in extension our visit. 

Bf doesn't care whether I'm a working wife or a SAHW but he thinks I should have just done the test because ""it's just a test"" and it's not like they would reject me if I failed it. He thinks it's a fun tradition that everyone was looking forward to and I should have gone along with it anyways. 

My boyfriend thinks I'm the AH and suggested I make this post. If I really am the asshole, I'm sure you guys will let me know so am I?

EDIT: Adding this as it's been coming up. I know disclosing the country may or may not bring up some unwanted arguments that will violate the rules here. But just for context, it's a family tradition, not a national culture.",0
"tl;dr: i have large breasts that have caused me nothing but back pain, and my boyfriend thinks im self centered for wanting a reduction. 

For context, I (26F) was born with unfortunately large  breasts. currently my bra size is that of a whopping 38 E. Because of this, ive had INTENSE back pain, shoulder pain, etc growing up. 

Starting a few months ago, the pain had only gotten worse and worse- It seemed i couldnt go an hour without having to dramatically crack my back and swallow ibuprofen and still have to suffer pain. Ive tried yoga, stretching, exercising, and everything to try to eliminate back pain (i hoped that with a stronger core or something I'd be able to support my own chest), buy I've only found that it makes it worse.

So i did some research and found that a breast reduction was just what i needed- I thought about going down to a C cup or even a B. I wanted my back pain to be COMPLETELY gone. So, about a week ago, I brought up with my boyfriend (28M), thinking he'd take it well (he's always been supportive of me, so i trusted him) and he was PISSED. He told me that i was throwing away my body and ""caving in"" to ""societal pressure"". He said there was no reason to change my tit size, and that if i did, he wouldn't be attracted to me anymore. We argued about it for a good 2 hours before he tried to ""compromise"" with me and say he was alright with it as long as i didnt go below a D cup, because anything smaller than that was ""childish"". He also called me egotistical and self absorbed, asking me why i didnt talk to him about it sooner, or think he would care about it. I told him I didnt think he'd care so much about me changing MY body, and he stormed out of the room and has been passive aggressively ignoring me ever since, even to the extent that he wont say i love you back, or sleep in the same bed as me. 

So, Reddit, i just need to know. Am i the asshole for this?


EDIT: 😂😂😂 I was not born with large breasts, but they are a genetic thing that ive had since i was about 16!

EDIT that im sure no one will see: As of May 15, after finally deciding to professionally measure myself, i am not a 38E, but rather, a 34H. Not sure how i could have messed up to drastically 😂 Also, I dumped the boyfriend! Good riddance",0
"My (34F) husband (43M) has been getting onto me about being on my phone around our daughter (2F). 

I am in a full time residency program. I work or study at least 60 hours per week. In the mornings that I’m not in the hospital at 5:30, I do all the morning routine: diaper, breakfast, teeth, clothes, clean the kitchen, etc. When I get home from school or the hospital, I instantly have mom responsibilities and do the bedtime routine every single night. I also cook dinner most nights. I do household chores in the evenings after bedtime before studying. 

Sometimes I get mentally overstimulated. I’ll at times pull out my phone for a few minutes to browse Reddit or IG to distract myself. It’ll be max of 5 minutes once or twice a day if I’ve finished eating first or my daughter is busy playing with my husband. My husband gets very upset and tells me to put my phone away in front of our daughter. He reminds me that he never gets on his phone in front of her. I understand where he’s coming from, but it’s not like I’m neglecting her for my phone. I just feel sometimes I need sometimes distance myself from all my responsibilities to lower my stress before going back to chores or school work.

AITA for getting on my phone in front of my toddler?

Edit: I see how some of my wording can make people think my husband doesn’t contribute. This was about why I feel overstimulated, not him, but poor wording on my part. He is primary parent during the days he’s not sleeping (3x12s at night 7p-7a). Our daughter adores him, and he’s a wonderful and very involved parent. We’ve had our share of disagreements about how chores are split, but it’s physically and mentally draining to be on nightshift. I appreciate that he’s working hard to financially support us, so I do a little more of the chores, but he does help. From the majority of the responses, I should just walk away instead. It makes sense and is something I’ll be trying harder to do :)",0
"So I am 22F. I don’t have much knowledge about finances and stuff as I still live at home as I’m at university. I do however pay my parents about £300 a month rent, I pay my own phone plan, buy material stuff I want or need, pay out for other services like for music or whatever and try to put as much as I can in savings whilst still keeping enough in my main account for day to day purchases. Currently, I am saving up for driving lessons and hope that if I pass decently, I can use some of my savings towards getting a car. I’m in my final year of uni so I’ll be done and able to work full time when all this happens. 

I also decided to get a credit card so I can learn how to manage credit wisely and build some up. My credit score is good for someone of my age and circumstance but obviously it’s nothing great in comparison for other stuff. I should point out that at most I only plan on using this card with a total adding up to £100. Ive stuck to that so far and only actually used it twice with these purchases only adding up to £80 and I paid it off quickly. I do not plan on exceeding my limit any time soon as I’ve heard far too many horror stories of people just using their credit card too much cos it was handy and getting into debt.

The only people I disclosed this to was my dad as my mum has the tendency to blab to my brother and SIL (both 28.) She happened to overhear us talking one day and before I knew it, my brother and SIL got wind and asked me if they could use it. They both admitted they had debt spurned on by excessive credit card use and thought that since I basically had nothing owed on mine, it was “free money.” I told them quite politely that I was really uncomfortable with that idea and that I would owe the money and I can’t Magic up that kind of money. 

Things went quiet until a few days later they both turned up at the house. They were nice to start with but basically started demanding I let them use the card and they tried to manipulate by mother into guilting me into doing it. I got really angry and when my brother said I owe it to them because they used to babysit me up until a couple of years ago, I laughed in their faces and walked out.

When I came home, I learnt they tried to manipulate my dad and he kicked them both out. My mother then tried and he told her to go too and she is currently staying with my brother and SIL. The only person on my side is my dad who tells me they’re all trying to take me for a ride and they’re trying to manipulate me cos I’m young and they think I’m vulnerable. My brother, SIL and mum on the other hand think it isn’t a big deal letting someone else use my card. It’s really messing with my head and I just want everyone to stop being in an argument. AITA?",0
"My teammates thought she should get a reduced score. I think she should get no credit for it (she would fail the class).  Heres our abridged email:

Dear Prof,

We are reaching out concerning the participation and contributions of one of our group members, C. We wanted to wait until the end of the project, as we assumed she would eventually do some portion of the work, and wanted to give her the opportunity. She did not.

We worked on our project by planning our work first, then coding individually assigned tasks, and finally coming together to analyze our results and make adjustments. We collaboratively outlined our tasks, and allowed C to choose work to take on. Despite this, C completed none of the work assigned to her and provided no reason why, and did not attempt to get help from the team in completing her tasks or finding alternative ones if she encountered difficulties. She rarely contributed to team meetings, and only spoke when asked a question. For key meetings where work was being done, she made an excuse and either did not attend or came for a few minutes. 

We think that it’s easiest to quantify her effort by detailing her tangible contributions to the project. In all the lines of code in our final docs, none were written by her. Her largest contribution was in summarizing a portion of the work done by other members of the group for one section of our part 1 report (approx 20mins), and her section had to be rewritten by us. She did not contribute at all to part 2. We strongly believe that if C was asked to summarize the details of our project, she would not be able to do so, as she did not attend the majority of the meetings for the second half of our project, nor did she do any work.

We understand that no group project has perfectly equal participation, but in this case, the participation was so unequal that it necessitated disclosure. I personally have never had a teammate at Y contribute so little to a project, and make clear in her interactions with other members that she did not have a meaningful excuse or feel bad for doing so. We feel that allowing C to take credit for our work is a violation of academic integrity.

C was assigned work for both parts of the project and chose not to complete any of it, not informing us of any difficulties until our final meetings before each milestone deadline. We ask that you take all of this into consideration when grading our project and can provide you with more information.

C's excuse for not attending the first meeting for part 2 was a case of 'food poisoning,' and she was then spotted by one of our members out partying on social media that same night. She failed to attend all but one of the subsequent meetings. When asked at that meeting if she had any work to contribute to our final report, she said only that she ""hadn't had time to complete anything.""

Please let us know if anything can be done to address this issue.",0
"I’ll keep this short, we have three kids and when they turn 12 I start making one of their chores about finding something to do. For example, make your bed, dishes away, and find a chore. So the kid will look around the house and find a chore it can be anything.

Really did this to teach them to see if something is dirty or needs fix and they can go and do it without needed instruction. Sometimes the kid pick something small like vacuum a rug, other times they pick something not realizing how big the task is, reorganizing the game room for example. Anyways it teaches them to figure out what needs done and then do it.

Overall my oldest kid took her only a little bit to do this. My son just turned 12 and he is struggling, I’m trying to get him to understand. He got so frustrated today that he couldn’t see what needed to be done in the house that he locked himself in his room. Tried to have him write a list of what he though could be cleaned in the living room (did not work)

My husband is pissed that I am giving them “mental load” chores and called me an ass. We had an argument and really I am just trying to help their problem-solving skills

Edit 

Omg, just because he is indecisive doesn’t make him have ADHD or anything, stop with blanket statements. Also yes we had him tested. Some people are just more cautious, yes indecisiveness is a symptom but he has basically no others and was tested.

Some people are just indecisive, could be for thousands of reason like lack of confidence, wanting to have things perfect and so on.  Not everything is ADHD",0
"Edit/Update:

The moderators have been kind enough to let me update my post.

I know many, many people have asked about the skillset I mentioned. I just can't be specific because it'll make my younger kids' company identifiable with a quick search. I will say it's nothing mysterious and is a combination of woodworking, metalworking and some masonry sometimes. It's just a niche product and not many people do it. The tools and techniques are unorthodox.

I spent a lot of time reflecting yesterday after reading everyone's comments.

I have talked to my younger kids and I explained to them that even if they aren't happy with how their brother approached it, it's clear he feels left out from our family and it's all our responsibilities to help fix this.

They agreed to extend the offer of apprenticeship again to their brother where he works and learns as a salaried employee. But they've made it clear that no ownership can be transferred after he's put in at least three years of work like they have. I actually think this is generous because they are paying a salary that they don't need to.

However, I'm not sure if my oldest will go for this. He is feeling some sort of way about working for his brothers, not with them.

I reached out to a teacher in Alaska who I know casually. He might do me a favor and take on an apprentice. 

I need to scrounge up some money and see if I can send my son there. But again, it's Alaska and I'm not sure if my son will be receptive.

I don't know what else I can offer at this point. My wife is disgusted that we've become that family that is fighting about money. She wants to force the twins to give a stake in the company to their brother but I really think it's a bad idea. They need to fix their conflict first or it'll just be a disaster. I don't believe we should be telling our younger kids on how to run their company.

I'll be meeting my son this Friday for dinner. I hope he'll be ok with at least one of the options.

I also need to talk to my parents to stop creating more issues. They've always enjoyed chaos and like pitting people against each other. It's not helping.

Thanks everyone.


This is the original story:

This has quite literally fractured my family.

I have an older son from my first marriage who's now 24. I have two younger kids from my current marriage who are 21 year old twins.

My divorce occurred right after my son was born. 

Over the years, my visitation has been primarily summers and holidays since my ex-wife moved to a different state.

I have a particular skillset I'm was very good at. And all three of my kids have expressed interest in it. Unfortunately, I have only been able to meaningfuly teach it to my younger kids.

This was because to make my visitation with my older son more memorable, I would do camping/vacations etc. I didn't have time to teach him properly.

Also, anything I did try to teach him was forgotten and not practised because he lived in an apartment with his mother.

The major issue now is that my younger kids have started a company after highschool using this skill. I provided the initial funds and as such have a 33% stake in it. This company has really soared this past year and it's making a lot of money.

My older son graduated from college and is doing a job he hates and is not exactly making a lot of money. Especially compared to his siblings.

Part of this is my fault because he did ask to take a few years off after highschool and maybe have me teach him what I knew but my wife was battling cancer at the time and I told him I couldn't.

And now, I'm not well enough to teach anymore.

He is now telling me to include him in this company as a equal partner. That he'll do the finances.

This was not received well by his siblings who say they do basically 95% of the work. And that he didn't struggle in the earlier years to get it running.

I'm really at a loss here. I thought of just giving my share of the company to my oldest son but it does seem unfair to his siblings who started this company in the first place.

My oldest has become very bitter about this and has involved my parents. They are taking his side and now my younger kids are resentful that their grandparents have been turned against them.

Our Sunday family lunches are no longer happening and I'm having to see my oldest for dinner on other days. And everytime I see him I'm getting accused of not treating him fairly. It kills me because I made so many compromises to have him in my life in a meaningful way.

He accused me on Saturday of pushing him out my new family and loving his siblings more. I haven't been able to sleep since.

Should I have done all this differently?",0
"Growing up, my mother had a horrible habit of trying to one-up my Aunt Terra. She did everything from dying her hair like my aunt, making our living room a replica of her's, and getting better versions of her pets. My Mom was the ""pretty sister"" growing up, married ""better"" and had ""better kids.""

This caused huge resentment for my siblings and I. Everything we did was thrown into our cousin's faces. This led to us not speaking to my mother that often and refusing to go to see our Aunt Terra. I was close with my cousins \[we went to the same school\] but I hated when my mom was around.

What made it even more awkward was the fact my mom stole my aunt terra's names.

My oldest brother is Martin and a year younger than cousin Martina. I am named for my cousin Rebecca \[I'm Becca\] and we are six months apart.

I started going by Eve \[short for my middle name Evelyn\] when I was 13. My Mom refused to call me anything but Becca. But my whole family was more than happy to call me whatever I wanted. My brother went by his middle name as well.

I turned 18 and my dad paid for the legal name change. I am now Evelyn Surname.

My mom threw a fit and threatened to never speak to me again. I took her up on that offer and stopped contact. My dad has since divorced her and at 25 I have not spoken to her in *years.* She has reached out to me and said she was in therapy, had started medication for bipolar, and she wants me in her life.

I was almost tempted but she ended the message with ""I miss my Becca.""

I told her she had the wrong person, there was no Becca here. I told her when she wanted to speak to Eve I would be here. She has not reached out since.

AITA?

"I  live in a cottage that I inherited after my grandfather passed away three years ago. The cottage is one of the oldest homes in the area and unlike my neighbors I am not a member of the HOA. The cottage itself is a waterfront one in which I have a small grass yard that turns into a beach on the lake. I never had a problem until recently over a seaplane and buoys. Due to having a private pilot’s license and being really fortunate, I own a Piper Super Cub on floats. When I am not flying the plane is either tied to my dock or is pulled up onto the beach and strapped down when the weather is bad. 

&#x200B;

A month ago I decided to make some new additions to my property, these additions were two lines of buoys at the edge of my property with signs on each. The buoys extend 15 feet past my dock and are still technically on my property. The signs themselves are ones that I got custom-made warning about prop wash. I decided to add the buoys and signs because whenever I take my seaplane out there are sometimes boaters/ kayakers who will stop to watch me leave. Normally this is not an issue if they keep their distance however recently they have been getting too close for comfort. 

&#x200B;

With the addition of the buoys, I can keep a 100 X 300 ft safety rectangle. This makes it so that at the bare minimum I will always have around 100ft off of each wing of safe space. Additionally, it prevents people from cutting me off when I come to dock or park on the beach. About a week and a half ago I got a letter from the HOA.

&#x200B;

 The HOA is demanding I move my plane to a local seaplane base as well as remove my buoys and signs. In response, I wrote them a letter explaining the reasons behind having the buoys and told them I have no intention of changing anything. About two days later I got an angry visitor who was an HOA member, I told her that if she or the HOA comes onto my property again they will get arrested for trespassing. Before leaving she used some very colorful words and called me an asshole.",0
"A little back story. I (24m) have a car rock, it used be my grandfathers and he would always have it in his car as a ""lucky totem"" and had it for about 30 years according to my mom, but he passed away when I was around 5. I don't have much to remember him besides a few pictures of us, his ring, a knife and this rock. When I turned 18 my mom gave me the knife, ring and rock because my grandfather wanted me to receive these on my 18th birthday. I keep his knife in my room, wear the ring everyday and in the past 6 years I've had kept that rock in my car too and kept it as a lucky totem as well. Sometimes when I drive ill have the rock in my hand and just rub my thumb over and it kind of gives me peace of mind. I don't really know how to explain it in words I guess.

&#x200B;

So onto the story. This happened last night. My friend ""Jane""(26F) car is currently in the shop for repairs of a accident (she got rear ended and it messed up her whole back end). So the past week she's has either been ubering or asking friends to pick her up when her shift is done and thats around 730 pm. Her work is about 30 minutes away from me and she lives about 10 minutes from me. So last night she called me at 7pm and asked me if I could pick her up and so I said sure no big deal. So I pick her up and everything was fine until I picked up  my rock and staring rubbing it, Jane asked what was in my hand. I showed it to her and said ""this is my lucky rock I sometimes rub it whenever I drive."" She asked to hold it and I gave it to her. She told me that the rock is stupid and before I could say anything back she threw it out the window. I screamed ""What the fuck why did you do that?"". Jane said ""Rocks are stupid and lucky items dont work."" At this point I'm probably 5 minutes away from her house so I pulled over in a grocery store lot and asked her to get out. Jane asked why I was making a big deal about so I told her the meaning behind the rock. And finally I said ""Until you find that rock and give it back to me, never call me for a ride and you're never allowed into my car again."" She ended up getting out of my car and I drove to vicinity of where she threw it at and I spent about 2 hours trying to find it. During those 2 hours friends from our group called me asking what happened and I explained my side. Most of the group knew the significance of the rock because I've given them rides before and they asked about it. Those ones are on my side but the last few are calling me the asshole because I left a woman alone to walk home in the dark. I do feel guilty for kicking her out and I felt like I could've handled the situation better.

So reddit AITA for kicking my friend out of my car and banning her from entering my car over a rock?

Edit: I will update if I do or don't find the rock.
Edit 2: Thank you everyone for the kind words it really means alot. I haven't found it yet but I am getting a group together to help me search for it Friday. A few people have asked for updates so I'll probably give a more detailed one on Saturday or Sunday.
Edit 3: for some reason my update got removed but here it is Update: AITA for kicking my friend out of my car and telling her to never call me for a ride?
Hello! A lot of people have asked for a update regarding this, I ended up looking for the rock on the day I posted it (Wednesday) and the day after. I couldn't find it on those days either. I called the friends who were on my side and asked if they were free Friday so they could help me look also, the ones who were 'against' me were also willing to come look because my other friends explained to them the importance of the rock and are now fully on my side. Friday comes along and we(there were 7 of us including me) started searching the whole street, we took the advice of some very helpful redditors i.e. throwing another rock out the car to see where it could land, searching farther up or down the street and searching the other side of the street too. One of my friends(rick) ended up finding it about 200 ft. down from where we were searching. I screamed a fuck yeah and basically jumped on him crying, I told him thanks and asked the group if I could buy them all dinner as thanks, they said sure so  we all agreed on pizza and beer. Then we went to Ricks place to eat, as we were talking the topic of Jane came up, someone asked if she's still part of the group. All I said was ""I don't care if she's in the group or not, I'm not gonna not gonna force you guys to stop being her friend, I'll be cordial and make small talk  with her and that's it."" So as of right now Jane is still part of the group because two of them have been friends with her longer than the formation of the group (10+ years?). So the next day I call jane to let her know what happened, she immediately apologizes and doesn't give any excuse as to what happened or why she did it, she does feel guilty and told me she understands if she's out of the group. I just told her what I told the group and also ""Its going to take a long time for me to trust you again and maybe even longer for me to call you a friend."" I ended the call after that and thanked my friends again for looking. 

So that's really it I found my rock and Jane is still apart of the group but is like 4 arm lengths away from. I'm happy as hell for finding the rock! Thank you everyone for the advice and kind words. It really means a lot that and thank you so fucking much,.",0
"Last year I bought an EMOVE Cruiser electric scooter which I’ve since modified to add more speed, a new handlebar and some other mods. The scooter itself was not cheap, at $1500, plus mods puts it over $2000.

I have a sister(43f) and a nephew(13m) who I always let housesit for me while I’m out of town on business. I have pets and plants that I need taken care of and they always welcome a change of scenery. So I had to go on a business trip last month for a week and let them house sit. My nephew has always asked me about my scooter and I told him that it isn’t for kids because it’s extremely fast and I’ve expressly  forbidden him from riding it multiple times. His mother knows about this as well.

Well, I come back from my trip and my sister tells me that I’m going to be mad, but my nephew took my scooter out, left it unattended and had it stolen. I was fucking pissed and asked them to leave.

I told them they’d have to replace it and my sister pleaded with me, they couldn’t afford it, it was a mistake and that he could do just do chores around my house to pay me back. I told her that it doesn’t replace my scooter. She said that any money would have to come from their vacation fund. I said, tough shit.

Our parents have gotten involved and said that I’m taking it too far. They agree that my nephew should be punished and I should be paid back, but to take away their family vacation is just cruel and petty. They suggested a payment plan. I told them, hell no, that I use my scooter to commute to work often and that I wanted it back immediately. Furthermore, he was warned not to ride it since it’s dangerous. 

Now that I’ve started to calm down here a little, I wonder if I’m being an Ahole here by being so demanding and potentially punishing everyone else for my nephew’s mistake.

Edit: 

Hey reddit, I went to sleep last night and didn't expect this to get so popular, so thanks.

Now to clear a few things up: People are taking offense to the verbiage ""let"" in my OP. Okay, let me explain, my sister and nephew view housesitting as a mini-vacation. I've offered money every time to them do the job, but they refuse, so I give them free run of the house and money for meals.

I had insurance on it, but they won't do anything without a police report. My sister did not file one, she didn't think the police would accept the report because it wasn't a car or some nonsense like that.

And no, I won't be filling a report with the police over my nephew. Listen I'm furious at him and my sister, but I'm not going to get him into legal trouble over this. He needs to be taught a harsh lesson, but jail time and a record isn't one of them. At least, not in this instance.

That being said I'm going to take some time, and think of an appropriate and harsh punishment for my nephew. I'll probably ending up accepting the payment plan, but insist on interest. It's not about the money, it's about the principle.

That should be all for now, thanks.",0
"Hello. Looking for some opinions.

I'm a man, age 50-ish. I ran a reasonably successful one man business for 25 years. I was the sole bread earner for our family throughout that period. My wife has a college degree and a Masters. She has never used her education to become employed. She stayed home with our kids who are now in college. My wife stayed home and did the things she likes to do, read, cook and etc. She also traveled to Europe and in the US to research a book she has been writing for I guess going on 17 years. 

About 3 years ago the industry that I am in began a serious decline that it shows few signs of pulling out of.; it's much smaller now. Before the market bottomed our cash flow sucked. Clients paying late, or not paying, etc until about a year ago. At that time, after fighting tooth and nail against it, my wife grudgingly sought out and accepted a basic part-time job for minimum wage. My suggestions that she use her degree to obtain employment were met with anger. 

My wife, since the part time gig, has grown massively resentful towards me that she has to work a job. Her opinion is that this is my fault she has to work because I have failed at my role of being a father/husband, that I ""did not keep her safe"" and allow her to live the life that she lived back when revenues were much larger. The resentment she shows towards me grows larger every day. 

Now, her boss wants to apply for a full time job at the same firm. She is considering it because it comes with health benefits, which we have been paying for. But she is now very resentful that this job offer may come to fruition. Very.

Her resentment ... It's affected every facet of our relationship: we have not slept in the same bed in a long time and none of the usual marital fun stuff is happening. We were on the cusp of having sex once but she just got up, said I didn't do my job in keeping her safe and since I don't then there's no reason for her to have sex with me. She got dressed and walked out of the room.

Once, in a rage about having to work, she went into our just left for college son's bedroom and smashed all his furniture, scaring our younger son. 

Thankfully that level of behavior has not since resurfaced. To explain it to our then (crying and scared) 9 year old she said that she ""just had a moment"".

I tried to talk to her about seeing a medical professional regarding this situation. Sadly, what came back is that because I have taken anti-depressents in the past that I am the one who is mentally ill. Or that I am ""gas lighting her"" (had to look it up).

She just left for work about an hour ago. This after very unfriendly body language and pained silence from her, for hours prior. No kiss goodbye, no ""see you later"". I heard the garage door close.

I am grateful for this forum and the opportunity to vent if nothing else. It felt good to get this all out finally. Thank you.",0
"For a lil background, my sister has a huge temper over almost anything, especially if she doesnt get her way. The only reason my family sees her is because we want to see our niece and give company to my sisters boyfriend. 

I have a bookbag that i take with me almost everywhere. Despite it just being a plain bookbag, it holds sentimental value to me since it has charms that i have gotten from my friends, boyfriend, my family, and traveling. 

We went to my sisters house and i placed it on a chair and walked away to get settled down and a few moments later, my 2 year old niece walks up to it and starts playing with the charms. I saw she had her hands in her mouth and they were visibly dirty so i place my bookbag on the counter so she couldnt reach it. She didnt care and walked off to play with something else. Cool, right? Well…not to my sister. 

My sister starts screaming at me saying that im “a piece of shit” for not letting her “innocent baby” play and look at my charms. She started crying and kicked me and my mom out of the house.

Me and my mom get in the car and now she is lashing at me because we got kicked out and arent able to see our niece and how i shouldnt treat a baby like that. We got home and i went to my room crying and questioning everything ive done in my life and now here i am. I just didnt want baby saliva and germs on my shit that means a lot to me.

Am i the asshole for not letting my niece play with my bookbag?",0
"I (30f) have been with my boyfriend (30m) for just shy of a decade. He’s a very clean cut guy and very professional in appearance. I on the other hand have a sleeve of tattoos, dyed hair, and pierced ears. He WFH as a lead programmer for a company while I work as a manager/pet groomer. Despite our opposite looks and career choices, we have lots of interests and opinions in common, if anything I think our differences help balance us out. 

Some background that may help add context to our relationship. I started getting tattoos before we met but my biggest piece was done 2 years ago. He’s not a big fan of tattoos and has absolutely no plan to ever get any (I’ve never pushed but I have asked if he’d get a tiny one with me) it’s not a big deal for me so after he said no, I’ve just left it. He wasn’t a fan of my big piece, but because I’ve had ink done before he voiced some concerns about the amount of money I’ve spent but left it at that. 

Fast forward to this past month. I’ve always liked the jewelry that people with stretched ears get to wear. Some of it looks really cool/pretty and I, on a whim, decided I would stretch my current piercings. With the help and advice of a friend, I got a kit and have been working on stretching with the goal being about a 2g/0g max. When I first told him about this he voiced that he really did not like how they looked and he did not want me stretching to the point where you could look through my ear or fit a pencil. I told him not to worry and that I’d stop before I got to the generally accepted “point of no return.” Today I was moving up from a 10g to an 8g and he was watching me moisturize and sanitize my jewelry and ears. Once again he asked how big I was going and I showed him what a 2g looked like. He gave me an unpleasant look and explained that he again really hated how gages and stretched ears looked. He further went into explain that stretched ears were not my aesthetic as it was more “punk” where I fit more into “streetwear” or “gal” styles. He doesn’t like how they look and doesn’t think I’ll look good with them. 

I was disheartened. I took out my jewelry, packed them up, and put them away to maybe discard. I’m now sitting here debating whether I should continue stretching because it’s something I want for myself or if I should honour his wishes and stop. I already pushed my luck with how many tattoos and how big they are so maybe I should give up on this one thing. I don’t want him to think I’m unattractive so I don’t want to change myself past what he’s willing to accept, but I also don’t want him to tell me what to do with my body.

So WIBTA if I continued stretching my ears after my boyfriend expressed how much he hates it? ",0
"I (22f) have always had a hard time during Christmas. Growing up my family wasn’t well off so my gifts were always combined since my bday is right after. Because of this I didn’t expect anything from my family, but I did ask for a little financial help since I just moved into my new house and didn’t have enough money for groceries and I told them I would pay them back. ( I asked for $200) My family informed me they couldn’t help which was completely understandable to me since I know they don’t have much. Then Christmas came along, on Christmas Day my mom told me “since you’re struggling right now don’t worry about your phone bill just double it next month”, which I was okay with until I saw all of my brothers) gifts. One of my older brother received a $300 hat and my 14y/o brother got a Boat. Because of this I felt angry and like I didn’t matter. AITA for feeling this way? Am I just ungrateful for the little things I got?



Update: I would also like to add that shortly after Christmas I posted one of my cars for sale hoping to make up the extra money I needed. When my parents found this out they told me that shit happens and that’s just life. Mind you this is a car that I’ve had for almost 5 years and have been completely transforming it. I have not don’t anything recently due to financials. It simply sits. I also come from a car family where my dad has multiple project cars and thousands of dollars worth of rc cars that he won’t use or sell.

"
My aunt(36) and her husband(38) have been having marriage issues for the past 6 months or so. I(22f) hate it for them because I love them both. My uncle and I have always been cool and friends because he is fun and easy to talk to. 

I went out to a bar on Saturday with some of my friends. I was surprised to see my uncle walk in. He told me they had a fight and he came there. I didn't know at the time that he turned his phone off and left it in the car. He told me allll about their fight. A couple of hours in I got a text from my mom telling me that they were fighting and my aunt called her to talk about it. I wasn't sober, so I was not thinking very far ahead. 

I talked to my uncle about it and he asked me not to say anything and that he would be home in the morning and they would work it out. He hung out with us for most of the night. After that I assumed he did what he said and they went and worked it out. Apparently someone told my aunt where he was and that I was also there with photos. She sent me this big long text telling me that she feels betrayed and she is really mad at me. I apologized and told her that I just didn't want to get involved. My family is really pissed at both of us and I feel like shit. Now that my family is upset, my bf is upset. I didn't think anyone would possibly think something sketchy happened or was going on because we have drank together (not alone) since I was like 15.

"Okay, little context. 

I work in a very dangerous industry, one where I am at risk of either serious bodily injury or death every single day. I don't want to name the field I'm in because it could reveal my identity and I'm not into that. Let's just say it's tied to the aviation industry. So because my job constantly has me at risk, I have a written will, like most folks. I'm 25 btw, but the nature of my job makes not having one a very bad idea. 

In addition to the will, I have written a letter to my best friend to be opened only if something happens to me. He holds onto both for me. 

I had to take him an updated copy of my will so I had it in my car to take to him on the way to work. My dad (who I currently live with due to some money constraints I don't want to get into) needed to move my car. So he used my keys to move it and he found the letter. To be clear, the issue isn't that my dad moved the car. That's totally fine. He's got places to go and I wasn't home so whatever. 

To his credit, he didn't open the envelope, but he was curious. It had my best friends name on it. In addition to having a personal letter to my best friend, I also had a few other letters for other people too in there for him to distribute in the case of my demise. 

When I got home, he asked me about it. I explained to him what it was and he was furious. He yelled at me and asked me why I didn't have him hold onto the letters instead of my best friend. I told him that the letter was personal and between me and my best friend and to please stay out of it and that he's been holding onto this stuff for at least two years already and that these where updated documents. 

He was so angry he left the room and hasn't talked me. 

My best friend feels terrible about it, it's not his fault. But I feel bad, maybe I was the asshole here but I just don't know. 

The reason he was holding onto them in the first place was I didn't think I could trust my dad not to open my letters to other people in my life that are important to me because of previous experiences. 

So, I just don't know.

"I intern in an office where I assist associates on their projects. There are other interns besides myself. I’ve enjoyed working here until a new associate (we’ll call her NA) joined the office. She seemed very friendly and sometimes hung out with us interns after work. However, she became too personable at work that it encouraged my co-interns to be less productive. As time went on, she began gossiping about other associates, which made me wonder if she also gossiped behind my back.

A few weeks later, NA and I had a work-related argument one day, and we spoke about it in her office in private. I found out the next day from a co-intern (co #1) that NA told him very specific details about our conversation. This frustrated me because NA and I had agreed to keep our discussion private. I called NA out on this the following day and she denied it, claiming “he must have overheard.” 

The last straw happened a few weeks after this when one of my co-interns (co #2) did not complete her daily tasks because she spent the day with NA in her office talking about her personal life, leaving co #2’s tasks to fall onto me. I spoke with the office manager about it and NA overheard it. The next day, NA told co #2 (behind my back) that I “was talking shit about her to the office manager.” At this point I decided I didn’t want to assist NA with her projects because of her tendency to gossip about others while expecting the interns to view her as a supervisor. I spoke with another associate who has seniority over NA, and he agreed to assign me more of his projects in place of NA’s.

I then went to NA’s office to tell her I wouldn’t be helping her anymore. She angrily stated she was the supervisor and that I had to listen to her. I responded that she doesn’t act like a supervisor by gossiping about co-workers behind their backs and refusing to own up to it when she’s called out on it. During this argument she interrupted me, refused to acknowledge my perspective, and even claimed that she had done nothing wrong. By now it felt pointless to try to resolve this any further. 

We both left the argument angry, and since then I’ve set my boundaries by refusing to speak with her if unnecessary. I don’t greet her or acknowledge her presence. If either of the office owners ever assign me a task that would require me to speak with her, then I will keep it short, but this is yet to happen. I’ve been much happier since I’ve not been interacting with her. I still assist other associates with their projects. I sometimes feel bad when I notice her briefly glance over at me from the corner of my eye and I can see that she’s visibly hurt. I don’t get any joy from seeing her upset, but I just can’t bring myself to interact with someone who continually stabs me in the back and denies any wrongdoing.",0

So the thing with my mom, is she always tries to budge into my conversations. She'll try joining when I talk to my friends, my girlfriend, or my sister (14F) - really anyone. Then, she'll judge whatever they said or did - and afterwards tell them off.

If I was talking about a person - she'd interrupt ""Who?"".

If I was talking about a thing - she'd go ""Whaaat is it?"".

If I was showing a friend a picture or video - she'd come over, peek, and go ""I wanna see, I wanna see!""

When I tell her that I don't want her to do that, she'd start whining. She is a single mother (father left), and she uses that to guilt-trip me. She'll say ""You're just like your father"", ""When it's my funeral you can celebrate with your dad"", ""I'm your mother, do you know what I went through so you can survive?"", etc. (I think you get the gist). Then, me and my sister would get the silent treatment for a LONG time.

She thinks that 'my friends are *her* friends too', which is really weird concept to me.

So...yesterday. I was talking to my girlfriend about some plans during our holidays. My mother, naturally she came up to us and demanded what we were talking about. My girlfriend said ""Can you just fuck off?"". My mother looked stunned and started telling me off for not sticking up for her. In a fit of annoyance, I shouted ""But she's right. You're too needy. Just leave us alone and stop bothering me!""

My mother started sobbing. She said she wanted to move out and leave us (sis and I) alone. She went out for some fresh air and said ""Don't come look for me"".

I know she's probably guilt-tripping me, but she has depression and I feel really bad. Everything is really tense and I feel like an asshole for making her temporarily walk out. My sister is terrified (understandably) and worries that she'll lose her other parent. Today my mom still hasn't returned from 'outside', and my sister is blaming me. AITA? Did I go too far?

Update: My mom messaged me and said she'd come home before tomorrow.",0
"Im 19M living with my single mom 45F since she divorced my dad when I was 4. She has a girlfriend who used to live next to us wich came over with her son pretty often. Now they live far away but the oldest son 24M, helps his parents with paying bills, expenses etc, wich my mom brags about to tell me indirectly that I should pay her monthly for the sole reason that she is my mom.

I'm still studying and looking for a side job to earn some money for myself, we've never had money to do anything, been in debt our entire life, and never been able to even have a bank account because it would get seized by the government. Since I was a little kid I've always raised money by working for my grandparents, or other friends, being able to buy stuff I wanted, a gaming pc, an Xbox, new keyboards... (I'm studying for It and pc's and gaming is my passion) and I've never asked my mom for anything since I've always known she didn't have the money, and when I asked for it when I was a kid, she always refused calling that it's bad for you to have a console, typical parent phrase.

I've been working pretty hard for my grandparents (wich pay me 20 bucks a day to do hard work gardening, and I know it's low but I get to stay there and they cook for me and take care etc) so I've also been buying more stuff than normal, an arm sleeve (20 bucks), hand warmers (20 bucks), gloves (40 bucks) and mouse skates (5 bucks) for myself since we don't have warming or anything that gets to my room, so I use my hand warmers, sleeves etc to not get cold in the winter. I'm also helping my mom (for free) to make her books digital, wich for people who know takes A LOT of working hours, wich could easily cost ten thousand dollars at the cheapest.

Today I told my mom I'm going to the cinema with some friends to see a new movie that just came out (note that for 10 bucks you have a drink, popcorn and a seat) just to get told, like every other month that I'm a bad son, I send all my money to buy my stuff, that I should pay her electricity bills, internet, help with the food expenses and everything that comes to her mind, just like the kid she brags about. I consider myself a calm person and I always have tried to be kind to her and help her out with stuff she couldn't do, and just told her that not everyone does that, it's a special case, the kid is a dropout from high school wich only does physical hard work, and after his physical ""peak"" is over it will be pretty hard for him to succeed at life since he has 0 knowledge about anything, just obeying instructions. She lately has been telling me that she will kick me out of the house because I don't want to ""help"" her financially and told me I'm not going to achieve anything in life, and I don't know what to do, AITA?

SMALL EDIT: some people think I work everyday, but I just work when they need to, roughly twice a month wich let's say brings me up 50 bucks a month",0
"I (35 M) bought my home 5 years ago. When I initially bought the property the back fence was rotting, allowing me to see into the backyard of my back door neighbor. I wanted to put in a new fence because the fence that was on the neighbors side was a 4ft chain link fence and I no longer wanted to see them due to prior incidents. The incidents: I own three dogs, they are all big (80-90lbs) and one of them can leap really high. I was afraid that any one of them could jump over to the neighbors yard and harm one of their dogs (they have two, one big one and a little terrier one). There is also the fact that all the dogs are extremely reactive to each other (barking, growling, high-tails), a behavior I do not want to enforce but the neighbor thinks is ""cute"". I have had four separate incidents with this neighbor because of the dogs. so I decided to put up a new fence. The one i chose was metal so neither myself or the dogs could see the neighbor. The problem started when I put down the posts - the neighbor claimed I was building on her property and started a scene. After reviewing with the contractor, it turned out she was right. That part of the property was part of an alleyway. So without complaint I moved the posts and built the fence. When I finished building, she decided to put in a new fence and she used MY fence posts to make the new fence. Now my yard is 4 ft smaller and hers 4 ft bigger. The most recent  incident happened today. Her dogs dug a hole under the fence, but they couldn't make it to my side. I paved my yard. One of my dogs tried to dig back and sliced his paw on the fence by getting stuck between the concrete and the fence and the neighbor's dog messed up their snout and paws by trying to dig into the pavement and trying to sniff at my dog from the bottom of the fence. Something that she is complaining that I should pay for. If you hadn't used my fence posts this wouldn't be an issue, I'm not paying for the dog, I already had to pay my own vet bills because of this whole thing. I have had enough and am planning to get legal. I am going to contact a lawyer and see what I can do as well as the county.  
Would I be the a-hole if I contact a lawyer and inform the county about the fence?  
I believe I could be due to something a coworker said. I would be starting a neighbor war and I am only acting out because i'm angry and that would be petty.",0
"My husband and I moved house in Jan and our new neighbour is elderly, to begin with she was friendly, as were we and we went round for a brew and a chat.

She asked for our numbers in case of emergency which was fine, fast forward and her daughter messaged out of the blue giving me access to an emergency key and adding us to her mothers emergency line (if neighbour presses emergency button it comes straight to us and the company calls asking us to check on her)

Since then she has become rather crabby, taking issue with our jasmine hedge, first requesting we cut it down - I say no, she storms off…
She rings round another evening demanding my husband come look at the hedge, I eavesdrop to hear her saying ‘your wife said no’, he also said no to taking it down but compromised that our shared handyman will cut it back on her side completely at our cost any time.
Next day, I hear handyman in her garden, she lies and says we said to cut the hedge down…he doesn’t believe as she had asked him to tell us to cut it down when we first moved in, guess what, the answer was no! We like it and it adds privacy between gardens.

We have a newborn and the phone has gone twice in a week for an emergency, one was an accidental push and today it turns out she fell. She had double locked the door so my husband couldn’t enter, we had paramedics scaling our garden wall to get in as well as the fire brigade, my dog is going mental as they come through the house and baby is screaming. They finally get access and leave 3mins later as she is fine.

I can’t cope with the responsibility, WIBTA to be taken off the emergency line? Other neighbours warned us about her demanding nature and nosiness but we just can’t say no!

Small update: Thank you for all the advice and pep talks, honestly so helpful! I had myself removed from the contact list yesterday and just sent the follow message!

Hi X,

It's Y & Z, I hope you are well.

I'm just messaging to ask if you could please remove us from the Emergency line contact list please. We've recently welcomed our newborn  and it's too much responsibility for us right now.

Thanks for understanding,

"On monday my english teacher announced that our end of semester final will be early and it will be a group project. (we didn’t pick our groups) I got put in a group with this girl I new kinda (K) , some edgar (A) , and this girl who went to my middle school who was trying to start her music career (J). J has been sick all week and K and A have been fucking around all week i’ve told them multiple times “oh let’s start the project” they ignore me. I already knew by tuesday they wouldn’t do anything so I asked to switch groups and the teacher said she no but she can see who does the most work and if they do nothing they won’t get points but I will. The project is due  tomorrow and I just finished but should I tell them they’re about to not get any points, and they should add more to the project  so they can get their points too.",0
"I(22f) am on autistic spectrum so please express your opinions as directly and clearly as possible as I’ve lost my command on sarcasm and few social cues. 

Me and my boyfriend(now ex)(24m) broke up last week and he asked me yesterday to return the promise ring he got for me. It has a butterfly and two bands and made of platinum. 
He bought this 2 months ago but he paid for it using my card as he was jobless back then and so I was sharing my card with him temporarily. He got a new job last month but never repaid me for the ring.
So when he asked for it back I said no because after all it was my money spent on my jewellery. 
He said since it was a gift/surprise from him he should have the ownership of ring and he wants me to give it back to him for emotional help in moving on. He has offered me half of what I paid since I’ve worn it daily for 2 months and so the value has decreased of the ring.
Also he said since I’m autistic I can’t understand about emotional connect to things and process of moving on.

I’m not sure if it is true and don’t want to look like laughing stock to my friends so I’m asking here. AITA for not giving ring back? Or should I return it?


Edit: based on few comments I texted him since the ring isn’t his family heirloom and since I paid for it I will not return it and he says the ring is very similar to his family crest and he technically paid for it since it was him who drove to store selected the ring and paid even if it was my card… he was the one who did the physical act of paying.
Edit 2: I pointed out the gift part to him and he says it wasn’t a gift but a promise which he wants to take back.",0
"My boyfriend had to go to the ER after a accident, and he got a truly ridiculous bill back. I offered to fight the bill for her because I've done it before, and he said sure. 

I went all-out, because honestly if we were out 5 grand, after insurance, that would fuck up our holiday plans pretty bad. 

So I...

- had him call the hospital and authorize me to handle his bill and access his medical records. 

- got an itemized bill and compared the prices for each code to the fair prices

- called billing to dispute the bill, but was told that billing only collects bills, I'd need to contact admin to dispute

- bounced around a call center for hours trying to get someone who was actually qualified for bill disputes, and getting nowhere 

- google and linkedin searched for the hospital board of directors and upper management 

- got 30 emails of the most influential people at the hospital, plus the hospital's investors

- every day would send a few emails, working my way up the chain, and writing an (increasingly long) email describing how they billed my ""client"" at 7 times over the fair price for services rendered, and how their billing department, customer service department, and the growing list of management I'd emailed, had failed to address the issue. 

- escalated the emails until I was writing the director-level staff with the entire board of directors and a number of outside investors CC'd, asking for a written statement regarding their justification for billing at a rate 7 times higher than the national average, for commensurate services to what is available at other hospitals. And sternly laying out the failures to appropriately respond, at every level of the company. 

Well, once I'd done all that (which was honestly only like 15 minutes a day) they reduced the bill... From $5000 to $26. Yep, twenty-six fuckin dollars. 

Well, I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was at first overjoyed and blown away, like literally jumping up and down and hugging me and saying I was literally a Christmas miracle. 

But then when he asked how I did it, I said it wasn't too hard, I just had to send a couple emails each day. He was curious what I'd said, and I handed him my phone. 

He started to get stressed, and flipping back through other emails. Which there were like 60 of.

He told me I went way too far, he was expecting me to dispute through their billing department or something normal and reasonable like that, not internet stalk every single manager and board member and investor and harass them into dropping the bill. 

I was frustrated because I'd just saved us 5 grand, actually made it possible for us to afford a nice Christmas and save some money, and he was mad at me because I'd been a bit of a hardass? 

I was furious, and he was also mad at me, saying he authorized me to dispute a bill, not basically threaten and harass a whole damn hospital for weeks. 

AITA for how I got my boyfriend's medical bills dropped?",0
"I (41M) have been living with my roommates (married couple, 41M and 36F) for several years now. Four years ago they had a daughter.

I work a full-time, night shift job. The wife of the couple works at a restaurant. The husband is an online content-creator.

A few months ago, I was asked by the husband to watch their child for ""a couple hours"" while he ran errands. I agreed to, since I had just gotten off work. It was around 9AM at this time, and I figured I could always sleep right afterwards.

Well, a couple hours turned into EIGHT HOURS, as the husband used this time to get lunch, run a few extra errands, and acquire some stuff for his online stuff. I was already angry at this point, and when the wife got home I told her what was going on.

Then the husband got home with what he felt was ""proper payment"" for watching his child: a $6 pizza from Little Ceasers. I essentially got paid 75 cents an hour for watching their child.

A couple weeks ago, I was asked again by the husband if I could watch their child. I flat-out refused, reminding him of what happened last time. He got angry, calling me selfish, and that his errands are now going to take longer. I told him it's not my child, and I was not going to watch someone else's kid for almost nothing. He stormed out with his kid and said that if I need something from him, I'd better rethink about asking.

Was I being an asshole?

EDIT: I want to clarify something in this post, as I've seen it in the comments, but the wife is an innocent bystander in this. She was at her job when this went down. She didn't know her husband was going to pull this nonsense, and even she agrees what he did was bullshit.

EDIT 2: Holy crap. 1800 likes! Anyway, to answer another question, the husband is a TTRPG streamer, and he had spent the majority of that eight hours at the local gamestore buying and painting minis for the game he runs on Twitch.

Yes I did call him while he was out, because one of the cats got sick and threw up in my lap. When I called him to tell him what happened, I was told to ""Call him when something important happens.""",0
"I (F27) live with my parents. I have a job and I have been helping them by paying rent and buying groceries. 

My brother is married and has two children, a two year old and a newborn. He recently lost his job and has asked my parents if he can move back in until he is back on his feet. 

My parents told me that I would need to move out of the basement suite in the house and into my mom's hobby room while my brother and his family stay with them. I did not agree and they said it was their house and their rules. 

I don't really own a lot of stuff. Everything  in the suite belongs to them. I don't even own my bed. I packed up my clothes and my laptop and I went to work like usual. I work out of town for 14 days then I get 7 days off. While I was at work I booked an all inclusive for my week off. It cost me less than rent and food at my parents house. I told my parents my plans and they were cool with it. 

I started getting texts a few days ago asking where my rent and grocery money was. I said that I moved out. That if I wasn't loving there and eating there I wasn't going to be giving them money. 

They got really upset because they were counting on the money to help support my brother. They said that I moved out without giving notice. I said that they LITERALLY gave away my living space and that I didn't owe them anything if I wasn't there. I asked them how much they are charging my brother.  I was giving them $1,800 a month (Canadian money) for rent and food and I was only home a maximum of 14 days a month. Usually less. 

My brother called me to say I was an ass for not helping him out. I pointed out that he hadn't sent our parents money when he was employed. He said that he had a family to support so he needed his money. He said if I came back he and his family would move upstairs and I could have my space back. 

I had actually done the math though. I can stay at all inclusives which cover my room, maid service, food, alcohol, and entertainment for 2/3 of what I was paying my folks. And I don't have to live through Edmonton winters when I'm not working. 

I sent my parents $500 to help them with groceries then I went to the beach. 

My parents, my brother, his wife, and a fair few of my other relatives are saying that I'm an asshole for abandoning them on a time of need. 

I think if I'm not there I shouldn't have to pay anything.

"Throwaway because are you fucking serious.

I [22M] am a middle school teacher who failed up into a job I'm not qualified for and I've been so stressed that I lost 15 pounds. I called off work a week in advance for a mental health day to get a sub, and filled out an office form for a sick day because I don't have like, personal PTO yet.

The office lady wasn't thrilled with my form and kept asking why I was calling off, how I knew I'd be sick a week in advance, etc. I tried to deflect with oh it's personal, oh just a doctor's appointment, all that shit and she wouldn't drop it. Said I could take a half day for an appointment, shouldn't use my sick time. And I sure wasn't gonna tell her my sick day was a sick of this job's bullshit day, so the 4th or 5th time she asked I just snapped and said circumcision, I'm getting circumcized again. No idea where it came from since I'm not Jewish but it ended the conversation.

I've been told that this was rude and that I should've just walked away but like ??? I try to end all conversations long before circumcision comes up. But also like, as a teacher I know I should be professional, and I'm gonna have fairly regular contact with this lady, so AITA?

"I (M32) have been an ordained minister for about 12 years now. I did classes through my church to do my sisters wedding, from there I did friends, family, and odd jobs. I did one where the bride wanted me to dress as Spiderman. Another where the Groom wanted me to sit with his mother and read it to her first, get her blessing, then do the real deal. I do maybe 4-6 weddings/vow renewals a year and most times it’s through word of mouth through the church and friend groups. 

  
My coworker, Sean (30sM) and his fiancé, Jared (??M) asked if I could officiate their wedding. I told them I’d think about it, but I’d rather get kicked in the nuts repeatedly. Sean thinks he’s super sassy, but in reality he’s just a dick. He comes by my desk often, says something “sassy” and leaves, and his “sassy” remarks are just hurtful. Telling me I have birthing hips, saying my outfit is clashing, my hands are dryer than my humor. I thought maybe I’d do it for the fiancé’s sake, but birds of a feather flock together. I know I should just man up and just do it, but I cannot find it in my will to help someone who makes my work life hell. When I brought up that I’d consider it, Sean said I officiated another coworker’s wedding, so it shouldn’t be hard to consider. 

  
This is just a parttime thing I do, I don’t even make money off it, I do it because I enjoy it. I cannot see myself enjoying this, especially for someone who sucks the life out of me. My sister agrees that I should tell him to kick rocks and find someone else, but she’s afraid they’ll see me as a homophobe if I don’t do it. I’ve officiated weddings for both m/m, w/w, and they/they, but I doubt they’d take it into consideration if I tell them no.

"Yesterday I was invited to my friend's (19F) apartment as a small get together. Besides me, she invited two more friends. She sat everyone down with cake. She seemed very happy and running around. Then she revealed she's pregnant. Everyone congratulated her and gave hugs. I just stared and asked her if she's crazy and keeping the baby? 

She said I was very rude and to leave. I love my friend, I do, but she is very irresponsible. My first reaction is she's going to ask me to help. She already asks me to help her rent every month. She's currently the other woman, and the father refuses to leave his girlfriend for her. She doesn't make enough to take care of a baby, nor has anyone to support her besides me and two other friends. It would be better in the long run if she put the baby up for adoption or have her aunts take it but they live across the country. I do feel bad for blurting it but she doesn't think things through.

"Okay, okay, I know how it sounds. Please let me explain. I (26f) have a ton of medical issues, including some that create major dietary restrictions. Real dietary restrictions, not some random fad diet that has false medical benefits. 

My cousin (k) had her wedding a couple weeks ago and they did not have any menu items that I would be able to eat except a couple of the appetizers. Even then, I am a little uncomfortable because they chose buffet style for the side dishes and catering creates a lot of opportunity for cross contamination. I would never expect someone to change or add to their wedding menu on my behalf so I messaged her as soon as we received the menu and just let her know that I would be unable to dine with them at the reception because of the dietary stuff and let her know that I would come back after I was able to eat. 

I understand what it is like leading up to a wedding and I received no response to my message, though it was on fb and I knew she had opened it. I decided I would just put together a little lunchbox and leave it in the car so when I started to get hungry I could just go grab a snack and come back in. 

Well, the reception came and all was well. Then dinner time came, and K came up to me and asked why I leaving the venue. I told her that I just had to get some food in my belly and that I would be right back to finish celebrating. She got an appalled look on her face and asked why I would bring food to a wedding I knew would have some of the best. I let her know about the restrictions and reminded her about the message. She said “I just figured you were being dramatic and someone in the family would get you under control. Guess nobody could.” My jaw hit the floor. I wish that my restrictions could be casually broken, but unfortunately I get quite ill if I break the food boundary. It is well known within my family that this is true. I’ve ruined a holiday or two by accidentally eating contaminated food. 

Anyway, I really didn’t know how to respond so I just walked out to the car and had my food with the company of the car radio. I am the queen of being hangry so I hoped that getting fed would help me get a better grip on the situation but I was still shaky mad. I came back in prepared to sit quietly and get through the rest of the night without too much more to say but my aunt and uncle came to the table and told me how much I hurt k’s feelings by bringing my own food. I explained (although I still feel a certain sort of way about having to explain) the restrictions again and told them I tried to be as polite as humanly possible by reaching out beforehand and leaving my snacks out of sight of the reception guests. They told me it gave the whole wedding a bad look and if it was really that big of a deal then I needed to eat beforehand. Nobody else has really weighed in and at this point I really don’t know if I was in the wrong. AITA?",0
"So, my (28M) partner (32M) works full time in construction. [Edit: we are both men. Not that it matters, but I’m getting called “she” a lot.] He makes decent money because he’s like a supervisor guy, but he’s very busy. He leaves the house by 5am every morning.  

I work a little doing some freelance document translation from home, but it’s probably about 10-15 hours a week. I mainly make sure the house in order and that my partner has everything he needs (cleans clothes, packed lunch, dinner made, house stocked, etc). It’s just the two of us; we don’t have kids or pets. He does house work too, mainly outdoor things like lawn care or fixing anything that breaks.  

Anyway, I usually go grocery shopping on Fridays. So this morning I went to make his lunch, and we didn’t have that much. We were out of lunch meat, so I improvised. I sent him a lettuce sandwich. It was a thick layer of iceberg lettuce, with tomato, onion, cucumber, Swiss cheese, and mayo on a large Kaiser roll bun. And then I sent  a Tupperware of these seasoned, crunchy chickpeas that I make in the oven, two Lindor chocolate balls, and a can of flavored fizzy water. I thought it seemed like a decent lunch, anyway my mom used to make lettuce sandwiches when we didn’t have money.  

Well, he texted me kind of mad. He said, “What the hell is this? It’s just lettuce.” I said we didn’t have any meat, and I was just trying to put something together in the morning before grocery shopping. He said, “This is not a lunch. I’m going to be hungry all day now. It’s fine if we didn’t have anything, but just tell me and I’ll order in a lunch. Now it’s too late to order anything because you made me think I had an actual lunch but it’s just lettuce.”  

In general, he’s not one of those “carnivore” men who must eat meat at every meal, but we do usually usually eat meat. His job can be stressful, so I just apologized and said I’d do that next time. He didn’t respond but now three hours later, he just texted, “Yeah, you’re sorry but you don’t really know what it’s like to have to do hours of physical work on an empty stomach.”  

I didn’t respond, but now I’m feeling a little annoyed with him. Like, does he really have an *empty* stomach? It was a lunch after all. He is pretty big, like 6 foot, 220 lbs, basically no fat on him. So maybe he does need more. I don’t know. In general, I know he works very hard and I get to have a relatively stress-free life. So, I feel bad making his day harder than it has to be. But I feel like he’s kind of exaggerating. Anyway, it’s not going to be a big issue. And I already went to the store and am making homemade bacon double cheeseburgers and fresh cut fries for dinner, lol. But I was just wondering if it’s really so bad to send a lettuce sandwich for lunch.

Edit: So, the man is fed and happy, lol. I didn’t bring it up or act angry or anything. I just let it go, and he did apologize on his own after dinner. He basically said, “Sorry, I didn’t mean to be a jerk about lunch, but yeah next time just let me know if we are out of meat and I’ll order some food.” And I just said, “Yeah, sorry about that. My brain probably wasn’t fully functioning that early.” And that was it. Now we are chilling on the couch together, so all good. 

Oh, and the people wondering *why* I didn’t have food in the house, this man housed an entire tray of enchiladas for dinner yesterday that I was expecting to have leftovers to send for lunch today. I was gonna send that with a salad (not on bread) and some crackers, and the chocolates. That’s why I was at a bit of a loss this morning. 

Anyway, thanks for the responses. Lots of NTAs, but YTAs from people who’ve actually been in my partner’s situation. So, I’ll just be more mindful of that going forward. Thanks all!",0
"On mobile so forgive me.

I go to college in the US but am originally from an East Asian country, where my parents still live. Thanks to corona shutting down colleges, I’m quarantining with my friend and her family. Said friend and family are black (this is relevant I promise).

Friend has an older brother (J), and us three kiddos have been spending a lot of time together. One night, the three of us were drinking, chatting, generally having a good time, and we got onto the subject of anti-blackness in asian communities. I mentioned that my parents are super racist and yet constantly deny it when I call them out for it. Growing up, I’ve seen them move subway cars to avoid black men, and they are constantly joking with their friends about how horrifying it would be if their kid dated a black or brown person. And yet, they will always always always claim that they “don’t care about race,” they’re just soooo concerned about “cultural compatibility” and making sure that my and my siblings’ partners share the same “values” (but funnily enough this argument never comes up with regard to potential white SOs 😊). Anyway I jokingly said to J that it’d be hilarious to call their bluff by telling them we’re dating—we’re very similar in terms of “culture” and “values” (read: their parents are also well educated, upper middle class). Idk maybe it was the alcohol but somehow we actually ended up texting my parents, “hey can we talk tomorrow I have some kinda important news.”

I wake up the next day to a million texts from my parents. J and I both still found the idea funny, so we FaceTimed my parents and basically told them that we fell in love after being quarantined together for so long. 

You guys. The LOOK on father’s face will follow me to the grave. They didn’t respond and straight up just hung up on us. My mom called me back (no video) 15 minutes later and said “your dad and I need some time to process this information,” and hung up again. I didn’t hear from them in a while, but did hear from several family members asking me, “is it true you’re dating a black guy?” My aunt suggested that my time in the US is “corrupting” me and I should just fly home ASAP, corona be damned. After not hearing from my parents for 2 weeks, I texted them saying it was a joke, and that I just wanted them to acknowledge that they are incredibly racist (and hopefully work on it, but baby steps I guess). My dad yelled at me for ~45 minutes and since then all my aunties and uncles and a handful of cousins have been calling and messaging to berate me for “giving [my] parents a heart attack.” My brothers found it funny, at least. 

AITA?

TLDR: I told my parents I was dating a black guy to see how they’d react and to prove a point. They reacted very poorly and proved my point.

Edit to add:
I’m rereading this post and I feel like it comes off super flippant, which isn’t how I feel. So I wanted to add that:
1) I do genuinely feel bad, because those 2 weeks were the longest I’ve ever gone without hearing from my parents at all, and even now things aren’t really the same between us. Even if I do care deeply about this issue, I still love my parents and don’t want to cause them unnecessary pain, and I wonder if it was selfish and dumb to create this much conflict just to prove a point.
2) this is a touchy personal issue, as an ex of mine is black. Even after being together for almost a year, I felt like I couldn’t tell my family because I figured they’d react poorly, try to break us up, etc. I really thought I was protecting my relationship by keeping it a secret from my parents, but my reluctance to tell my family ended up being a significant contributing factor to our breakup. I’ve spent so much time regretting how cowardly I acted during that relationship. I truly never want to go through something like that again, and I guess I was trying to test the waters a little bit with this “joke.”

Edit 2: I hear you on the ESH verdicts/concerns about how J’s doing, and thank you for raising the issue. Please believe me when I say that I would’ve called it off immediately if I had reason to believe J was struggling. To clarify, the idea to actually prank my parents was largely J’s. My friend/J’s sister was also on board. The initial conversation went something like:

Me [following discussion about how my parents would flip out at me dating a black guy]: yeah imagine if I told them we were dating, ha ha ha 

J: (laughs) .......... but actually

Me: actually?

J: I kind of want to see what they’d say

Me: really?

[similar back and forth until we ended up drafting that text to my parents]

We talked in those 15 minutes between my parents hanging up on me and my mom calling me back, and J was laughing, seemed in good spirits and to have found the interaction funny. We also talked about it every day that I didn’t hear back from my parents; nothing super deep, but he was still joking about it so I figured things were ok. I also talked to him when I was thinking about coming clean to my parents, and he actually helped draft the text I eventually sent. Given this feedback though, I’m going to initiate a more serious conversation about how he’s feeling tonight.

Edit 3: I “held on” for 2 weeks because I kept thinking my parents were just about to come around. Idk I guess I just didn’t want to believe that my parents would really react THIS harshly. In hindsight I probably should’ve come clean earlier.

Edit 4 (and hopefully my last edit)—just some final clarifications/explanations:
1) Kind of a meta point, but I’ve seen some criticism of how I’m doing edits instead of responding in the comments? Uh there was no shiftiness intended I just figured a lot of people were raising the same points and responding in edits meant (I) I didn’t have to respond to hundreds of comments individually, and (II) everyone would see my responses. Sorry if that came off shady.
2) I’m 21, J is 23(ish? I’m not totally sure but I know he’s 1.5 years older than my friend)
3) I am in touch with my parents, but we’re not super close. We probably talk over the phone once a month or so, but they’ll usually send links to articles or random photos and updates every few days.
4) “This is karma farming, obviously you’re not TA for not being racist/being an ally.” I apologize if i didn’t make it sufficiently clear, but my question isn’t whether I’m TA for not being racist lmao, or even for calling out my parents’ racism. What I’m struggling with is whether I went too far in lying and creating all this drama just to prove a point and without much thought for its impact on my family, even if that point is important. 
5) What did I want to get out of the prank? I just wanted my parents to admit to their prejudice, because I felt like that’s an important first step in them educating themselves. I don’t agree that they’re too old to change at mid-50s. 
6) Why didn’t I just tell them about my previous relationship? Honestly, great point lol. Idk this plan wasn’t very clearly thought through. I didn’t sit down with the goal of teaching my parents a lesson and then come up with this after hours of strategizing; it was just a joke that got out of hand. My life is life, my decisions aren’t always entirely rational, and a relationship that I was in for 9 months 2 years ago isn’t always top of mind. Maybe it was disingenuous of me to add that info to my post, since it wasn’t what I was thinking of when I went through with the prank, but it is something I (I) think about a lot (II) felt was relevant to why I would take it upon myself to prove this point to a parents. Will I tell them about it now? Probably, but it depends. I think my parents and I are long overdue for a deeper conversation about this issue, and I will try to bring it up then, but if they seem super uncompromising I’m honestly not sure I’d be prepared to be completely cut out of their lives just yet.
7) Why are my parents OK with me staying with a black family but not dating a black man? It was never a discussion. When campus closed I told them I was going to quarantine with my friend. I’m not sure they even knew the family was black until this happened. I also think it is part of their “we’re not racist” shtick to be ok with POC in the context of friendships, colleagues, etc. but draw the line where there’s a chance that they’ll be brought into the family, if that makes sense, but idk. 
8) Thanks a lot for the gold!",0
"Me and my wife recently found out that her daughter (my step-daughter, though I consider her close enough to my own after having raised her for 18 years) has taken out about $60,000 in loan debt under our name, without our permission. For some basic context, she took out a Parent Plus Loan for school, under our name and social security number, without asking us. In her first semester of her Freshman Year, she did come to us, asking if we would fill out the paperwork for her, since her school's loans were only for about $5000 for the whole year. We explained that we didn't have the financial means to take out a loan for the amount she was requesting; about $14,000 a year, but offered to help her find scholarships or work-study, and other ways to potentially help her cover her costs. After me and her applied for about 5-10 scholarships, and she got a part-time job, she never came back to me and my wife with any financial aid concerns again, so we figured that she had largely figured it up. We brought up tuition a couple times, but every time we'd ask, she'd just say that she was able to cover it all, and didn't need any help with it or anything.

Come us, a couple years down the road. We've gotten a letter from the Department of Education saying that 'our' loan has gone into default, and has been so for about a year at this point. We reach out to her school and, after a little bit of digging, we discover that after we had told her ""no"" on the loan, she had gone around our back and applied for it all online. She filled in her own contact information instead of our own, and the loan went through just fine, since she had the correct Social Security Numbers and all. We've spoken with the school and the DoE a fair amount about this already, and we basically have 2 options for this. We can either eat the loan, and pay it all back ourselves (something not at all financially feasible for my family, since we have about $40k in Medical Debt on top of this now), or to go through the state to press charges on each one of the 5 loans she's taken out; each loan being over $10,000, making this a Felony in my state with a minimum prison sentence. At this point, I'm not certain what my family \*can\* do. We don't have the money to be able to pay this loan back, but me and my wife are emotionally wrecked at even the thought of pressing charges against our own daughter. So, here's the important question, reddit: if I press charges here, AITA?

Edit: Since there's a little bit of confusion, a bit of clarification. A Plus Loan is a loan that we would take out in our own name, to give her extra funds for education. Because we would ordinarily be the ones taking it out, she's not involved with the Repayment Process at all; she's not even technically eligible to make payments towards it, since it's under our own name.  


Edit 2: I promised myself I would never do anything stupid like this if I ever had a post blow up, but now I truly understand what RIP Inbox means. I really truly would like to thank everyone here for their support; I know reddit is one of the few places I can make a post and expect to get a reply.  


In reality, even though I've gotten a huge outpouring of support saying I WNBTA (is that a thing? idk) if me and my wife go through with this, I'm still 100% split about how I actually want to go. You guys have given me a lot to chew on, and I'd really like to thank you all.",0
"I married my wife 9 years ago. as a long time browser on this sub I know a lot of you may ask if I actually like my wife or why I married her. there's a lot of reasons. I won't put you guys to sleep though. the simple answer is I do love my wife, we share a son together and I could not imagine a life without her. my only wish is she wasn't so insecure but she is also human.

with that said, lets get started. My wife is 39 and struggles a lot of with insecurity. to remedy this she has surrounded herself with friends who truthfully she thinks lesser of. A lot of her friends have been out of shape, poor, mentally unstable and such and my wife has admitted she feels like the stable and sensible one with all of them. when she's not talking about them like they're charity cases, she's usually insulting them. (before it's asked, my wife is in therapy and says she likes the therapist but doesn't think she's truly the issue)

Now her youngest friend (31) Candy was one of the many friends my wife used for her own security. Candy was sort of a mess as a teenager, barely passed high school, couldn't hold down a job and was in and out of hospitals due to unmedicated mental health problems. I think my wife was probably the cruelest to her out of all her friends because Candy never really stood up for herself. at some point we didn't really understand how or what came over her, but Candy really did a 180, got medicated, got her degree and now is living in a nice country house, with a well paying job, her husband and 3 kids.

watching Candy change over the years has messed with my wife a lot. she's been crueler to her and constantly insults her house, her job, even how she raises her kids and loves to mention all the mistakes Candy made when she was young. Candy never said anything until yesterday. we were at her house around a fire and my wife asked how Candy could even be a fit mom after all her mental health problems and Candy, who was tippy, looks at my wife and says (Paraphrasing of course): You know, when I was young, I took your words to heart, until I learned you were just as messed up as me. And I realized to fully get back at all the ways you hurt me, there wasn't a point in telling you or asking for an apology, it was simply by being better than you. And now I am.

now I laughed, not so much out of humor but more shock. I got a death glare followed by my wife abruptly walking to the car and a threatening text she'd leave me behind if I didn't follow. we drove home in silence. when we got back my wife was crying in the bedroom. when I tried to comfort her she chucked all my stuff in my direction and screamed to leave. I now write this at my parents who don't think I'm wrong but at the same time they don't like my wife. AITA?",0
"A little history, my wife has been groomed to think seafood is disgusting and vile and she can't stand the thought, sight, or smell of it. I'm sure the grocery store section with the lobster tanks added to this intense ill-feeling.

Tonight my family had me pick up chipotle, which I do not care for at all, so I ordered PF Chang's which is right across the street for myself. I got the Kung Po Shrimp and we're sitting at the table at home getting our food together. My wife stabs a piece of my ""chicken"" and eats it while I purposely didn't say anything. I know most of the hate for seafood is mental so I was curious and the child in me thought it was funny. After she finished stalking the shrimp and made that ""mmmm ahhh"" noise I asked if she liked the shrimp. She called me a total jerk for not stopping her. 

AITA for letting my wife eat a shrimp without stopping her?",0
"I (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. My boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. He gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. I'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.

However, there's one girl in our class, let's call her Victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. She goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. I know this is the case, because I've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.

I've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and I don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. However, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. I rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. She was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him I was there too.

Victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. I snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. You're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'

She looked super embarrassed and walked away, and I later heard she'd gone home crying. I feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. AITA?

Edit: She 100% knows that I am his girlfriend, I have heard her talking about me being his girlfriend before.",0
"My ex wife and I adopted our son when he was six.  We had been his foster parents for three years and we wanted to make it official.  

He met his wife when he was 18.  She knew he was adopted and she thought it would be good for him to get to know his biological parents.  

Over the course of the next few years my ex wife and I were slowly pushed out of his life.  

When they got married we only recieved a wedding invitation.  We were not part of the wedding party.  His biological parents and their spouses sat at the family table.  

We have not had the opportunity to meet our granddaughter and she is nearly three years old now.  

I am sad about the situation but my ex wife is heartbroken.  I hate to see her hurt when all she did was try and be a good mom.  I can honestly say that I am not a fan of my daughter-in-law and I wish she had never come into our lives.  

Recently they have run into financial problems and they lost their home. My son's job is in the city we live in and his biological parents and his in-laws all live in other cities.  He called my ex wife to ask if they could stay with us while they got back on their feet.  

I said no.  My ex wife wants to but I refuse to be used.  He has been distancing himself from us for nine years now.  The only reason he called was because he is desperate.  I don't think I owe him anything.  I offered to pay for whatever it costs for him to move his family to the cities where his real family is.  

His wife called me to scream at me.  She says that I am abandoning my son and grandchild.  I said that since he didn't think of us as parents when they got married and had a child then they should not think of is that way now.  Then I blocked her.  

My ex wife says that I'm being too harsh and that I need to forgive them.  But here's the thing.  I don't think it will change anything.  All that will happen is that they live in our home and then they abandon my wife again as soon as the chance presents itself.

#EDIT

He was removed from his biological parents because they were very young and it wasn't a good situation.  If they had been older or more stable at m sure they would not have severed their parental rights.

#EDIT 

Sorry I edited my post to make it more clear.  His mom and I are divorced.  She is in an extended care facility and he cannot live there.  I kept our home.  I am still friends with her and we see the kids together as a family.  I still care for her deeply but her condition wasn't something she wanted me to deal with.  Our son didn't even know we had separated when he called her.",0
"I (30F) work in an office of 30 people. I started working for them during the pandemic. I worked from home fulltime until the beginning of 2023 when it became required to come into the office 2 days a week. Most of my job is client-facing, so I'm on the road quite a bit and am only in-office on average 3-5 hours a week. I'm friendly with everyone in my office but am not friends with any of them. I've never spent time with any coworkers outside of work hours aside from a few happy hours over the past few years.  
  
Every year my office does a Secret Santa where everyone fills out a survey of gifts they'd like to receive, HR picks givers and recipients randomly, and then you buy your recipient a $50 gift. My manager (\~50F) reached out at the beginning of November to asked me to fill out the survey for Secret Santa. I told her that she did not need to include me, as I'd be out of town for our Christmas party (the week between Xmas and New Years,) which she had approved. She told me it was fine and I could bring the gift for my recipient before I left and then I'd receive my gift when I returned. I told her I am not going to do that, and that she should just exclude me from the gift exchange. We've been going back and forth this whole month.  
  
She cornered me in the office this week to ask why I wouldn't participate. I told her the truth, which is that I am going on a vacation between Christmas and New Years with a few of my girlfriends as a joint celebration of our recent 30th birthdays. It is an expensive trip, I've been saving up for a long time, and I am trying to save money for the trip. Not to mention I typically live paycheck to paycheck around the holidays already to be able to afford gifts for my nieces and nephews, who I love dearly and actually WANT to buy gifts for. Well, she DID NOT like this answer and told me that I am being selfish and that it's only $50 for a gift to show my coworkers that I care about them, and that in this office we are a family.  
  
This is where I could be the asshole. I told her that while I like my coworkers just fine, I don't need to buy them gifts because they are not my loved ones. $50 could cover a manicure before I left for vacation, a souvenir while I'm there, part of a nice dinner, or any number of gifts for my family or friends, neither of which my coworkers are. I also told her it was wildly inappropriate of her to keep pushing this with me, as she has no idea what my financial situation is and if she kept asking me about it, I would be going to HR to file a complaint.  
  
I went into the office again today to take care of a few things before Thanksgiving weekend, and EVERYONE is giving me the cold shoulder. My manager is a huge gossip and I know she told everyone what went down between us. My surprise comes from the fact that most of my coworkers seem like rational people who would understand where I'm coming from and not judge me for not participating. The fact that they are acting like this has me wondering, AITA?",0
"My (21f) girlfriend and (21M) I are coming up on 3 years next month. Ive been living with my friend from high school for about 2ish years now and currently live with them still. My girlfriend still works part time and lives at home with her parents. As of 6-7 months ago I got a job as a full time HVAC installer after I went to trade school. The hours have been more than any other job I’ve ever had and I personally don’t have the biggest problem with the hours since I enjoy working in this field and learning more as I go since I’ve only been exposed to HVAC for about 13 months now. The hours get petty busy, sometimes I’m doing 80 hours per week and at times when it’s super busy they mandatory us to work mon-sat and if I’m scheduled to work that upcoming Saturday then I’m not off for 13 days straight and then I only get Sunday to rest before I have to work mon-Friday again. My girlfriend had been having some trouble adjusting to us not seeing each other that often. She only works maybe 20 hours per week and with the rest of her time she just goes out to places like the mall or she’ll chill at home in bed all day. I feel like I barley get to see my room nowadays and on my days off I really want to decompress and be in my own space for most of the day, that space being my room. She hates the idea of spending the day in the room on my only day off because she’s been waiting all that time that I’ve been at work for us to go out and do something but I truly am so exhausted at times that it’s a battle to get out of bed and be fully present and energetic. She says she feels as she has to lower her energy for me and that makes me feel bad. I’m trying to see her side and also get her to understand that I’m simply just so exhausted to do much more. She says I’m not being empathetic about this at all. I try my hardest to spend the day with her on my off days even if I’m fighting the fatigue but she gets upset with my on those days since I’m not always up to do everything she wants to do. I’m also normally the one who drives us everywhere when we do hang out and every day for work I drive 2 hours just there and back, and on average I drive another 2-3 hours on those days due to driving to the customers house from sour warehouse and then back to the warehouse. It’s just too much to be fully energetic by the end of the week. AITA?!

Edit: I may have worded it wrong but I have no issue hanging out with my girlfriend at my house on my days off, she is the one who doesn’t really enjoy it and would rather be out.",0
"Where do I start, how do I begin? To be honest it's a non-issue for me, but I thought to share my amusement with you lot. 

Some background: 
Ezra, my ex(M, 40ish) and I(F, 36) split in 2018 when after maybe 6moths in he started to show some red flags here and there. I ran for the hills, got over him, found my person, and am overall happy in my life. That's now. Then... I focused on work, him on his new gf, that lasted maybe 8 months. Their breakup also started the calls. First for support, but they soon evolved into bitching sessions I wasn't in the mood for. It got so bad I had to block him, the emails started coming. I blocked him there too. 

In the meantime I moved with my man, 2 blocks away from my best friend and within a mile from Ezra's baby mama place. 
I was on my way home from my BFF's, lovely night, I'm all tipsy and happy, headphones in and walk-dancing through the streets, when all of the sudden a wild Ezra appeared with kid(13) in tow. 

Since I didn't hear him calling me, he decided to rip one of my headphones and started yelling this and that. Basically rubbish on how I destroyed his relationship(never met the girl, so witchcraft it is!), and how I'm a huge bitch. Well... 

So I started barkin'. And kept barking, rising the volume to match his. People were staring, but I'm too tipsy so idgaf. Lucky for him, a clever boy, he got quiet quickly, looked around and left. 
Eureka! Something works! Since then every time Ezra bothers me in public I just bark at him loudly till he runs away. 


One of common acquaintances is a happy gossip, apparently Ezra is, in his own words, *traumatised* by my behaviour, he says I'm crazy, and I'm the asshole for humiliating him in public. Am I thought?

"Title is pretty self explanatory but my MIL has taken almost two years to meet our  daughter and to be honest I am pissed!! 

When she was first born it was in the height of the first wave of covid in my county and the states were locked down not allowing for interstate travel so I could fully understand her not being able to come down but our states have been out of lockdown for over a year now and in the past 6 months she has bailed on us twice. 

First time was just before Christmas she had planned to come down but then her adult daughter was moving out of home and she “wanted to be there for it” so she cancelled. 

The second time she was driving down, got literally half way here and got the news that her friends she was also meant to catch up with while here had covid and were in isolation so she couldn’t see them, so in her exact words she “could see the point” in coming down. 

When she said that I was PISSED!! 

She finally ended up coming to see our daughter last week but to be blatantly honest I’m still so upset that she took so long, and that she was here for 3 days and spent maybe 10hrs with our daughter, she was more worried about spending time with her friends. 

My partner thinks I need to cut her some slack because of covid but I honestly don’t think I should, she has had ample time and opportunity and just never wanted or cared to meet her. So AITA??",0
"So obviously this is a screwed up situation all around. My dad is 58 and a severe alcoholic. I am 22, I have a half sister who is 45 and a full brother who is 24. They live in different states. I did not stay behind to care for my dad but I’ve really been his only support system.

He has been in and out of rehab, he’s been arrested for public intoxication, public indecency, DUI well over 20 times and numerous other things that would probably break the rules to talk about them. This has been going on as long as I can remember. He is destitute, malnourished and has advanced ARD (alcohol related dementia) which is worse when he doesn’t drink. He can’t work, drive or care for himself in any meaningful way. I’ve been there for all of it while my siblings left a long time ago and have done nothing other than an occasional check.

My sister arranged for him to be put in a long term care facility (she was not paying for it, state funded) fairly close to me. He was “sober” but was caught several times stealing alcohol wipes to either suck on them. I visited him twice and it was like a horror show, I didn’t realize places like this existed outside of the movies. During one of his coherent moments he begged me to take him out. I told him the second he had access to alcohol he’ll drink again. He said he knew but he’s ready to die and he’s at peace with it.

I talked it over with my husband and we hired a specialist to examine my dad and he said if he drinks he has maybe 6 months left. We did a quick remodel on our house so my dad will have easy access to a bathroom and we said we will buy him a 30 pack of cheap beer a day and he can stay with us until he’s gone.

Yes it suck’s but on one hand he has his family, he’s not covered in bed bugs, hes clean and has entertainment. He’s not stealing to fund his habit, he’s not bothering the public and he won’t get arrested. 

My siblings think that he was going to get better in the facility and think Ive signed him up for a death sentence. I told them that they are welcome to move him to a facility closer to them so they can be the ones to visit him and see his food covered in roaches and his baths being wiped down with chemicals. My sister said she can’t because of her “reputation as a real estate agent” (my stomach hurt I laughed so hard) and my brother said he doesn’t want his kids to see their grandpa like that. Both ridiculous excuses but they insist on being angry with me when I’m the one who’s borne all the stress and heartache of seeing this in person.

To me this allows a man who has made some terrible choices in his life the ability to at least not linger in some hell hole for the next 10 years and die as crappy as he lived…but at least on his own terms 
AITA?

Edit: I can’t believe now this blew up. I’m sorry I can’t respond to everyone but such a sincere thank you to the first few comments and the threads with all the extremely helpful and critical information that my husband and I did not know.",0
"So I (18f) recently got an amazing opportunity to study abroad and I couldn't be happier or more grateful for it, I would be moving to an entirely different continent and I'll be gone pretty much the rest of my life, meaning I want to make a life abroad and not get back to my country once I finish my degree. 

My family knows this and it's completely okay with it however my friends and partner didn't seem so thrilled, they said it could be dangerous to go on my own and that I'm practically burning bridges with them by getting to the other side of the world. At first I brushed it off as a completely justified concern and assured them we could still be friends and promised to visit often ( I also told my partner that I understood having a virtual relationship would be tough and not for everyone, and told him I would totally understand if he needed time to think about it or just break it up and remain friends) but it was getting annoying, specially with my partner, he said I wasn't even giving a chance to the life I could have with him in our home country and that I wasn't really thinking of everyone that loved me and didn't want me gone, my friends supported him and ganged up on me the past week, I was fed up at that point and told them they were a far cry from being the most important thing of my life and that this is the future I've always imagined for myself.

After that everyone got mad at me and my partner told me to never contact him again, the rest of my friends have been ghosting me. I know the phrasing wasn't the best and they have a right to think I'm insensitive and to be mad at me, I also know an apology is in order for the way I expressed myself but I also think I did what was best for myself and honestly what I said was the complete truth. My mom thinks I should just board the plane and never spare them another thought but some of my cousins think I went too far and I was a big ass.
Edit: hi! First I'd like to thank you all for your kind and encouraging messages, I really appreciate your kindness and advices I'd like to thank you personally but there's tons of comments. I'dalso like to clarify everyone knew I was going to leave one way or another, it was all I talked about when the topic of plans for the future popped. My ex knew this too as we were close friends before being together but we both avoided the topic and just focused on the moment and seeing how our relationship would develop, I admit it wasn't the most mature thing to do but being 15 there wasn't really much room for rationallity. Finally, my decision is final, only divine intervention would stop me for doing this, I was just conflicted to wether or not I should apologize.",0
"**Throwaway**

I (M31) have been married to my wife (Sara, F29) for almost 2 years now. Things have been pretty smooth so far, and we haven't had any real arguments until recently.

Earlier this week, my younger sister (Amber, F27) came to visit. During her visit, Sara discovered that one of her necklaces was missing. Sara and I searched most of the house, but we couldn't find it anywhere. It was at this stage that Sara loosely suggested Amber might have taken it. I told her that Amber would never do anything like that, and the conversation ended there.

Yesterday morning, the day Amber was leaving, Sara told me she wanted to search Amber's room before she left. I asked her not to and assured her that there was no way Amber would have taken it. Sara didn't sound convinced but didn't say too much, and I had to run to work.

Later that day, when I was driving Amber to the train station, I noticed she seemed upset and was much less chatty than usual, so I asked her what was wrong. She was hesitant to answer, but I persisted.

She eventually revealed that while I was at work, Sara had requested to search her room for the necklace. Amber reluctantly agreed. After the search yielded no results, Sara proceeded to ask Amber to search her bags. Not wanting to argue, Amber complied, but nothing was found.

I was livid by this and apologized to Amber multiple times. I assured her that I would address the situation with Sara. Amber asked me not to, as she didn't want future interactions with Sara to be awkward. I reassured her that Sara's behavior was unacceptable and that she needn't worry.

After dropping off Amber and returning home, I confronted Sara about the incident. She claimed she ""needed to be sure"" and that Amber had been ""acting suspiciously"" and ""was being superficially nice."" I told her that her actions were completely unwarranted and a major breach of Amber's privacy.

Sara insisted that she was only trying to protect her belongings and said that she didn't believe her actions were disrespectful. She continued to argue that Amber's behavior had been suspicious, but I interrupted her, stating ""enough."" I firmly expressed that her accusations were baseless and that she had made my own sister uncomfortable in my house. We argued some more before I finally told her that I didn't want to hear anything more about the necklace unless it's an apology towards Amber.

AITA?

UPDATE - 5 Days after this post was made, the necklace has been found! It was in the trunk of my wife's car, it somehow got underneath the carpet.

And no, she still doesn't want to apologize. In fact she said she didn't want me to tell Amber it was found, but I told her nonetheless.",0
"AITA for being upset with my best friend?

I (23F) have been best friends with E (23F) for 10 years. We have been planning a future trip to my family’s home country since we were young and have more recently started to plan specific details. My family moved to the country we currently reside in when I was a toddler. We were talking about our trip yesterday and I mentioned that I was so excited that it’s going to be just the two of us like we planned. Then she decided to tell me that her boyfriend A (23M) will be joining us whether I like it or not and I have to be nice. I have never liked her boyfriend as he does not treat her well and is all around rude and childish. I told her that I do not want him to come because of his behavior and she stated that he’s coming, end of discussion. He constantly disrespects my culture and myself to my face and it would be an embarrassment for him to mock me there. When we have been out in the past, he has mocked my accent and makes fun of me if I say something in my native language. He is also notorious for ordering the most expensive thing on the menu and insisting we split bills evenly. I brought this up to her and she insisted that I am just being mean. I also believe that if he comes with us I’ll become the third wheel and spend the entirety of the trip completely ignored.I talked to my mother about it later in the evening and she said that I just need to get over it, but I don’t want him to ruin my trip. Our other friend agrees with me. This is the biggest fight we’ve ever had and E hasn’t spoken to me since and is giving me the cold shoulder. Am I overreacting?

I'm a 8th grade teacher at a public school in Montana and my school is mostly white but there's 3 black students in my class. One day there's a heated argument I'm not sure how it started but one of my black students called a white student a nigger. I told him that was enough and we don't use that sort of racist language at school (or anywhere i hope). He gets sent to the principal's office and he gets a detention. A lot of students then started yelling at me saying that i shouldn't punish him for that because he's black. They say he has the right to say that because he's black and i shouldn't punish him for doing so.,0
"Throwaway.

My husband had to sell his house in the middle of the pandemic because his dad got sick, had no insurance, and needed money for a transplant. 

My parents (mom and stepdad) own a home an hour away from where we lived that nobody lives in since they can't handle the long commute. They both rent places near their jobs.

When my husband decided to sell his house, they both offered the empty house as a place to stay since no one lived in it. My parents were already having marital problems.

While I was in school, my husband paid all of the bills. When he owned his house, he didn't have to pay rent, as it was covered by the renter's who lived with us. He had no left over money after bills were paid. We stayed on a very strict budget. We also have a toddler. 

Since my graduation and my kid's birthday were in the same month, my mom and my husband saved their tax returns, and took us all on a week long trip camping for celebration. I was the first to graduate college in the family. 

My stepdad threw a tantrum during the trip, and once we returned demanded we pay him money since we had enough to go on vacation. He did not contribute to the vacation. He wanted money to spend on things, not to spend on bills or rent.

My mom told us not to pay him anything since he did not pay the bills, even though they are in his name, and the bills that he did pay (half of the mortgage), she had to force out of him each month. Also, because when his kids lived in the house, they stayed for 4+  years without having to pay anything. We were only asking for a year. 

When we refused, he freaked out. He demanded that my mom kick us out within a week or else he would file for divorce. He cut the electricity, water, and took all the bills out of his name while we were still living in the house. He also refuses to pay mortgage as long as we live here. 

We are moving out in a few months. We would have moved out sooner, but the daycare near the apartment had no availability for my daughter as many daycare's have reduced their enrollment size due to COVID. We had to wait until her spot was open. We also needed time to save some money for a downpayment as my new job just started in June.

Fortunately, my mom is paid enough to be able to take over all the bills. My husband handles all the maintenance for the house, and even completes the renovation projects my mom wants (new floors, repairs), saving her money from hiring a contractor.

My stepdad decided to go to our church and spread lies about my family and my mom. He told them that we are teaming up against him and trying to steal the house from him. And that we refuse to leave out of spite. I've received multiple calls from people at my church telling me I am a terrible person for causing my parents to consider divorce, and why won't we just move out since we both now work? My husband and I had no intention of causing any trouble. We really want to leave right away but we have a daughter to think about.

So, am I the asshole?",0
"My friend (Emma) and I (F28) have known each other since 18 years. We grew up together, traveled cities together and have now settled in another country. 
I work in banking and she is currently a masters student and also pursuing some side hustles (photography, art, etc). I came here a couple of years before she did and have made a good group of friends who I hang out with (mostly in finance and from my business school), and we often hang out for birthdays, etc. 
She moved here last year and I’ve helped her in every way. Right from pitching her products on my days off at pop up shops, to even funding her short term courses for pursuing photography. She even crashed at my apartment for 5 months before she got her own place. She’s even trying to be an influencer. Basically i’m saying, i put in a lot of effort in our friendship, both financially and emotionally. 
I turned 28 last week and had plans with my finance friends. We tend to go out for fancy dinners for birthdays which cost each person close to $100. I told Emma we could hang out for lunch elsewhere because she doesn’t know them and i didn’t want her to feel burdened with the dinner because she’s still a student. I thought it made sense. For some reason she got really pissed off at me and said I’m being mean and don’t want to take her to fancy places. I invited her for dinner and covered her bill too. 
When we started clicking group pictures with our phones, she said she’s been taking photography lessons and that she wants to practice taking pictures (from her phone, not her professional camera). I told her it’s just a couple of normal pictures but she insisted we don’t take any pictures, either of the place or people, which didn’t seem like an issue.
The next day, when I asked her for the pictures, she sent me an invoice for $500 and venmo details as a receipt for the pictures. I thought it’s a joke but she was very serious about it. She told me if we can afford spending $100 on food, we can surely pay her for the pictures. I told her she offered to click them using her phone and that it didn’t really make any sense, plus she’s being a bitch. She told me she could really use the money and that it didn’t matter to all of us. We’ve been fighting about this ever since and i have literally lost my shit.

I (30F) am allowing my son (8M) to have a birthday party with friends at the arcade that my husband and I will be paying for. My son invited five friends from his class. Some parents asked where their children's invitation was at. I explained that my son wanted only five friends there and that since I was paying for these kids to play games that we needed to limit it . Some parents have said that it's rude to not invite everyone . The teacher got involved and told parents that she can't force him to invite everyone and that what my son did was perfectly fine.  But I need to know if AITAH?,0
"I blinked and she was married and pregnant. So I showed up. Helped her with baby showers. Her sisters funeral. And her second baby. She then decided her and her hubs were ganna move down south and she asked me to help. Which of course I said yes to. It was a 14 hour drive. I took off work for a week and drove with her and her 1 year old in one car. And her husband in the other. It took us 4 days to make a 14 hour drive. The entire drive she was yelling and screaming at me about how to take care of her kid. I worked at a daycare for a long time and have a lot of baby sitting experience, so I know what I'm doing in terms of child care. Especially dealing with parents. But they were awful to me. I realized I was the only one bathing their kid, changing and feeding him. Not a single thank you. They got into an argument because I went for a walk in the morning and didn't change their sons diaper. So after I returned he locked me out of the apartment with their son in over 100 degree weather. I packed, got in an Uber and left gracefully. Said I was homesick and taking an early flight. Never talked to her again and she's mad about it.",0
"Background: we are both college students, I live alone, and he does not have a key to my apartment.

My boyfriend got out of class early today and told me he wanted to come over. No problem, I had a Zoom meeting during the day but I figured it would be long over by the time he arrived. It was scheduled to end at 6:30, and he told me he would arrive around 7:20. I was starving the whole call and got dressed a few minutes before the call ended to leave immediately after to go to the grocery store.

I hadn't heard any updates from him so I assumed he was still on track for 7:20 (he claims I should not have assumed this and should instead have asked whether he would be early, this makes no sense to me, I don't think I have ever texted someone out of the blue whether they are going to be almost an hour early). I left the house for the grocery store, which is very close nearby. I don't know if it's my phone provider or the location but I get *no* service inside that store. When I was walking out I saw that I had missed calls and messages from him, I called him back but it went straight to voicemail because his phone had died.

I got back to the front of my building at 6:50. As soon as I came into his line of sight he yelled ""Took you long enough"". He was yelling at me about how I shouldn't have left knowing he was on the way, and everyone was staring at him while he was ringing the buzzer waiting for me. I kept trying to explain I had no idea he was coming so early, I mean he came almost an hour early but at the rate I'd gotten back he only would have been half an hour early which is a lot. He kept saying how he should have just gone home instead of coming to my house.

Once we got inside my apartment the yelling resumed. I didn't apologize because in my opinion an hour is a long time to wait for someone, if they didn't give you any indication they were going to be that early. I knew that the grocery store trip would take 20 minutes, which it did, which would give me more than enough time to be back to let him in. I also had no idea that his phone was low battery until I saw the messages coming out of the store (at which point his phone had already died).

It turned into an enormous fight, at least on his end. He kept telling me that since I kept him waiting the least I could do is own up to what I did and apologize for it instead of ""playing the victim"", but in my opinion I didn't do anything wrong. So, am I the asshole for leaving for the grocery store when I knew he was commuting to me?

Edit- I don't have the emotional energy to respond to every comment but I swear I am reading them all and I appreciate everyone who took the time to read my post and respond. It means a lot, I have been so confused over the past few months about what is normal and what is not, and I don't really have anyone in my real life I'm comfortable with talking to about this so I've just been in my head trying to figure out if I'm crazy. Thank you all again <33",0
"My (21F) mother (53F) has always been the extremely controling type. So much so that my very first whiff of alcohol was at 19, most of my friends started at 16, and I have also have never had a sleepover with any of my female friends (nor any of my family members, haha). Without dabbling into the details too much, I don’t want any bias on this, my mom has always had full control over my life. 

After having had to drop out of uni due to financial constraints, these being me kicked out because the fee-payer stopped paying, I took a couple of customer service jobs. Extremely low-paying, terrible work hours, easily pulling a 15 hour shift at least twice a week (7am -10pm). Recently, I got a new job. The pay is good, the work is great but very consuming, you earn every cent you make. 

Since getting this new job, I have made it my mission to get myself everything I’ve been begging for, for the last few years. I needed a new phone because my iPhone 7 was absolutely shattered, so I took out a finance plan for it. I had to get a new laptop for work, financing on that too. And earlier this week, I picked up my new (to me, 11 years old in reality) car. I was the only one of my siblings who was not bought a first car from my parents. Obviously, the amount of changes happening in my life made it seem as though I had a salary jackpot, I do not. I’m very good at saving. 

My mother has obviously seen this. I do still live with her in a rental house along with my unemployed dad, unemployed brother and his two kids. Our lease is up at the end of February and so, my parents have been viewing houses. My mother is blacklisted with the credit bureau right now, (side note, she was able to pay up all of her debt in 2020 after selling my childhood home. So all of the debt right now is very new) she has skipped her car payments, skipped her loan payments and pretty much anything else, my mother has a very good job and definitely can afford these things, her lifestyle is entirely too inflated, she spends way too much on entertainment and entertaining. 

Due to the blacklisting, the landlords of the properties she wants are not open to offering her a rental. Once again, inflated lifestyle, she only wants the best of the best looking houses. She has asked me to put my name and info down on her lease and “she will cover the payments”. When I had asked what it would do to my credit score, she snapped at me and started shouting about why I don’t need a good credit score because I’ve already gotten the things I need on my credit. 

Obviously, my mom is a terrible payer. That would reflect on my credit score and, at 21, I’m preparing myself to move out into my own apartment in the near future. My mother is not seeing it this way and has decided to give me the cold shoulder. If I greet her at any point during the day, she looks at me very blankly and continues what she was doing wordlessly. 

So Reddit, I want to know, am I the AH for not just putting my name down on the lease?

"I (17F) have a younger brother (10M) who I’ll call Jack. My brother has always been a curious kid, he’s always asking questions about everyone and everything. So, the other day I was packing tampons in my school bag, as I had just gotten my period a few days ago, and Jack had happened to walk into my room and see them. He asked what I was doing and what those things I was holding were. I didn’t think that I did anything wrong by telling him the truth. Obviously it wasn’t super detailed, but basically I said that I have a cycle where I bleed every month, which is my body telling me that I am not pregnant and that I need the tampons to help with the bleeding. My brother asked me if the bleeding hurt, and I told him no. I also told him that if he wanted to know more about them then he should ask my mum when she gets back. (She’s currently on a work trip) And to me he seemed pretty content with that. He was a little worried about me, but I reassured him that I was fine. I thought that was the end of it, but when I got home from school that day my dad told me that it was ‘inappropriate and gross’ of me to tell Jack about my periods, that he was ‘too young’ and that ‘a boy doesn’t need to be told about that stuff’ which I found strange because
1. I didn’t think my dad had a problem with talking about periods
2. I know for a fact that Health class in Jack’s grade is starting to introduce topics such as periods, and especially within the next few years there will be more talk about them at his school.

I have talked to my dad about my periods openly before, so has my mum, so I really didn’t think he thought they were gross or anything. I don’t know why he thinks it’s a big deal to tell Jack about them, especially because there’s no way to stop him learning at least a bit about them in the future. Personally, I actually feel men need to be more educated on periods.

So AITA?

"Hello! I've been reading this Reddit page for a while but never thought I'd have to post on it. I (17F) struggled a lot in my life with making friends and being bullied, most likely due to my level 1 ASD. I've developed people-pleasing tendencies since I fear the negative reaction from people. My sister(F24) takes things without asking me, and she will only apologize if she messes it up. I like my things in a certain way, and I take good care of my clothes because It's hard to find clothes that won't harm me sensory-wise. My sister knows this and will steal my clothes when she's at home. That part doesn't bother me as much as how messy she is. She will give back the clothes that are dirty and messed up, and sometimes I can't get it out since it's coffee or spaghetti. What broke the camel's back for my sister was that she stole my leftover food, but I'll get back to that later. I feel like I can never tell her that I'm mad at her for doing it, because when I do, she will scoff and ask me why I’m such a B\*tch. 

i love my mother, but she does something similar. Every since my brother joined sports, most chores have been pushed onto me since I only have clubs 3 times a week, it would be fine but its gotten so bad that I have to put homework aside and wake up early to finish it. and whenever I complain, my mother shames me for being ungrateful for all the work she does (She cooked dinner). She is also a stay-at-home mom, she quit her part-time job.

&#x200B;

2 things happened today that broke the camel's back for me, it's the weekend and I was so tired and stressed, and I also had a cold. My parents and brother went out to dinner after his game and asked what I wanted so they could bring it home. It was an Italian restaurant, so I said lasagna. I told my family I was excited to eat it. I woke up that morning to a text from here ‘I stole your food, sorry. Couldn't help myself.’ That hurt a lot and I told my father, He got onto her for not respecting my property. She got mad at me for telling him because it brings back her weight problems (He was mad she took my things, not that she ate). This sucked, but whatever, I said I was sorry for telling my father. Then what my mother did, My grandparents gave me and my siblings 100$ gift cards for Amazon. I've been excited to use it on art supplies and stationery. I already used 15 dollars for a watercolor set, so it was on Amazon. I went to check, and my mother accidentally used the rest of it. It had 80 dollars left. She said she made a little oopsie noise and shrugged. She said I should have switched it to her card I used my gift card. I broke down crying. I was so done with them, I know I shouldn't have but I couldn't stop sobbing and I yelled at them, calling them selfish. They got pissed and yelled back at me, my mom took my phone for a week. I locked myself in my room. Was I too harsh?",0
"Hi reddit, never posted before and English is not my first language so please be gentle with me. I made this account and this post at the urging of my son hoping to get some unbiased advice. I \[55f\] am the proud mother and grandmother of several children. The one in question is B my \[28\] daughter. She and her husband K \[30\] have eight children six girls and two sons. They had them in the space of seven years 5 singles and one set of triplets.  Her father and I ensured she had a trust fund growing up to take care of her future. Which she promptly spent on trips to go see K in Canada when they were long distance as well as several elaborate couple's trips that she paid for.  
K has a job as a construction worker which is a good respectable career and I am happy to see my daughter married and settled down. Here is where the problem started. I begged my daughter to please get some kind of useful degree it does not have to be in STEM it can be in anything she chose. Literally, just something that has some kind of opportunity to grow. She chose library sciences. Okay great. She loves to read and it's going to make her happy. Done.  
I paid for her schooling because she didn't want to get scholarships and I have the money because me and my husband are well off. So we paid for her education and thought that was it but then she got her job at a local public library. Making about 50k a year give or take while her husband makes 46k. My daughter is unhappy saying that her house is too small for her children and her husband and that four bedrooms is not enough space for ten people. I asked her what she wanted and she told me that I should buy her a new house. She says that her brothers and sisters all live better than she does and that she feels I am playing favorites with them. Here's where I might be the problem.  
I told her that my other children had not spent their trust funds and had gotten scholarships. That they lived better because they lived within their means and she got angry. I told her that while I had already paid for her education I would buy her a new home if in fact she or her husband went back to school and got better jobs, so that I could be sure they would not lose the house to foreclosure someday then I will buy them a new home as a graduation gift.  
She was PISSED. She threatened to cut me off from her and my grandchildren. Threatened to go no contact with me for the rest of my life and to tell everyone what a horrible mother I am. I felt awful, I told her I love her, I told her that she did it once and she could do it again and that I believed in her. And she got angrier. She told me over and over that it was because my husband is her stepfather \[it's not, he adores her and has raised her since she was three months old\] and told me to go back to my ""real family."" and I did. Now my other sons and daughters are on my side and saying that she is just being a spoiled little brat. But I feel awful, am I playing favorites with my other children? AITA? ",0
"My parents are divorced. My dad screwed our family over in the divorce. He got into a lot of debt and left my mom to deal with some of the fallout knowing she was a stay at home mom with no income of her own. He was somewhat controlling where that was concerned and he ""didn't want the mother of his children working outside the home"". Both households struggled for years because of his actions. As the oldest I (17M) had the burden of being made aware of this, which is something my mom yelled at dad for, because he encouraged me to get a job when I was 10 to help out financially. Mom was so angry at him.

While still in debt and not even formally divorced from my mom, dad met his current wife and moved her and her three kids into the house he was renting. They got married days after the divorce was finalized and wasted money my dad did not have.

When I was 15 I asked mom if she would feel comfortable with asking for full custody of me. She said of course and she refused to let me help with money (I had a small part time job at the time). Mom got full custody of me but my sister's still had to do the 50/50 thing. I stopped almost all communication with dad. But I can't entirely cut him off until I turn 18.

My dad still struggles with money and there were times, so mom didn't try and make up for him, that I bought my sisters stuff for Christmas or their birthdays that would make up for him instead. But they got them at home with me and mom. Dad became aware of this. And last week he asked me to let him borrow some money for his stepdaughter's birthday which was 2 days ago. I told him no. He texted me about 40 times asking for the money and saying he would pay me back March 15th. I said no again. I ignored the rest of the texts that came through.

The day of his stepdaughter's birthday he called and texted me a bunch and told me how upset she was to get no gifts and how shitty I should feel when I have made sure my sisters never feel that way and wouldn't do the same for a stepsibling. His wife also texted me saying I should be more compassionate.

"My baby daddy Jasper (25M) and I(27F) had a ONS, I'm currently 24 weeks pregnant. There was no cheating, but that's not important for the story.

Jasper's fiancé, Maddy (23F) lost their first child a year a year ago, I can't imagine going trough child-loss and I've been trying to be accommodating to her, but I've set a few rules:

1. She can't treat me as a surrogate because I'm not. This is Jasper and I's kid. She'll be the STEP-MOM, not the ADOPTIVE-MOM.
2. She can't be in the delivery room, I'm only allowed to have two people there and I chose to had Jasper and my mom. She argued and she really tried to push it, she wanted me to haver her a Jasper, I said no. She wanted me to have her and my mom then, I said no. I was clear that even if Jasper wasn't in the room with me, she wouldn't be allowed either way because I'm not comfortable.
3. She can't take big decisions for our kid on her own, she can suggest and she can ask. But she can't take them unless is an emergency.

Aside from that, we're all aware that this situation is not common and we will have to learn along the way, a few days ago we three went out to have dinner and Jasper asked if I had given any thought into our kids name, I said yes and gave him a list, I told them they can add some names to it and then we three could discuss them and chose one, Maddy told me she wanted to give them her dad's name as a middle name since it was special to her, Ill be honest, I don't like the idea because a family name (and a father's one) seems very personal, also I didn't liked it that she behaved like the decision was set since that's not our deal. Jasper didn't seemed that fond of the idea either so I told her that, while we could consider it and think about it, I wasn't sure. Maddy got quite pissy and said that it wasn't fair that she wasn't allow to have or say anything without passing it through the ''mom police'' because this was her child too. She can't be in the delivery room, she won't gave birth to them or have any legal rights and the least *I could do* is let her have the middle name.

Jasper tried to argue with her but Maddy refused, took her things and left us there. We stayed back for a while and he apologized for her before taking me back to my house. My mom says that she understands Maddy's pov, I'm having a child with her man after losing her own baby and she's not allowed to do *anything* without me or Jasper saying yes first and that maybe I should let her have it since middle's name doesn't matter anymore. I still don't entertain the idea but I want to ask anyway. I'll be happy to give more INFO if someone need it.

ETA: for come clarification we had a threesome and I got pregnant.

ETA: Woa, I didn't think this would blow up like this. I want to clarify some things.

1. Please, stop saying that Maddy is unhinged or crazy, neither of us planned this pregnancy nor is she traying to steal my baby.
2. I'm not living with them and neither are they living with me. We see each other regularly, yes, and we are still sleeping together (I called it a ONS to clarify that I got pregnant after only 1 time of being with them at the beginning)
3. While I'm still sleeping with both of them, the three of us AGREED that it meant nothing more. It didn't make us partners and they've their own relationship. I never sleep with just Maddy or with just Jasper, and it has happened only 3 times after I told them about the baby.
4. The three of us had a long talk today and I got to clarify many things with Maddy. Thank you all for your judgment, I accept them all. ",0
"My siblings (24M, 22F) and I (26M) were raised by a single dad (45M), our dad was great, he was loving, and caring and always put us first, because of this we never missed our deadbeat mom. My dad even sacrificed his love life though, he never dated anyone.

My brother (24M) disowned our dad around 3 years ago, for a reason I’d also disown him, to be honest. My brother found our dad and his then-girlfriend (27 now) “doing it”, thus my brother got mad at my dad and cut him off, moved out of the house, and went to live with some friends.

No matter how hard my dad has tried to apologise, and reach out to him, my brother ignores him, my dad has suffered a lot 'cause of this and has gotten mad at us many times since my sister and I know where my brother lives (We’ve visited him a couple of times) and he demands we let him know, but we can’t because my brother threatens that if we ever tell him he’ll go NC with us.

The thing is that this woman got pregnant with twins but she didn’t feel like being a mom so she left them to my dad, my dad tells everyone that he is raising his grandkids (he swears they are my brother’s but I’m sure they are his since my brother says he used protection).

The kids turned 2M a couple of days ago and he hosted a small party, so my uncle started asking about my brother (as the kids’ father since no one in the family knew what happened) so my dad started talking sh\*t about my brother saying that he was an ungrateful son and a terrible father for leaving two kids behind (I think my dad is angry at my brother for not forgiving him) as everyone in the family sees my dad as an example for the sacrifices he did, they started talking sh\*t about my brother.

I love y dad with my whole heart and I’d do anything for that man (I know all my siblings would) but he tried to portray my brother as a bad guy and I love my brother so I told him: “He wouldn’t have disowned you if you hadn’t f\*cked his girlfriend and got her pregnant” everyone looked at him and he tried to excuse his actions but everyone told him to fck off.

They’ve called my brother to apologise but my dad is angry at me, he says this is a family matter and I should’ve kept my mouth shut, my wife says I did the right thing but my sister is on my dad's side.

So AITA?",0
"
I (28F) have a three year old German Shepherd (Lou) who is the sweetest dog I‘ve ever met. She’s very cuddly and loving once she‘s gotten used to you.
However, she was abused as a puppy and has separation anxiety. (EDIT: we’ve been working with a professional trainer and she’s been making improvements) but currently, leaving her home alone for more than an hour simple isn‘t possible (EDIT: and my brother lives 45 minutes away).
It‘s hard to gain her trust, so getting someone to watch her on short notice is nearly impossible.

The last time I visited my brother (39M), his wife (42F) stepped on Lou‘s tale and quite obviously, it hurt. She didn‘t bite or even try do do so, but she barked quite loudly before running to hide behind me.

I asked my SIL whether she way alright and she said she was, so I didn’t think anything else of it. After all, she‘d known Lou for almost 2 years before the incident.

But when my brother invited me to his birthday party next weekend, he told me to leave Lou at home and when I asked for the reason, he told me SIL thought she was too aggressive to be around the guests.

She isn‘t, but it‘s their house, their rules and I want to respect her wishes, so I simply called my usual dog sitter who told me that unfortunately, they weren’t available.
Anyone else who has watched Lou in the past will also be at my brother‘s party so I don‘t have anyone to watch her.

I told my brother I could either

a) bring Lou and keep her on leash at all times,


or b) take Lou with me and take turns with my mum walking her around the neighbor so I could be able to stay a bit without his wife having to face my dog

or c) come over (with Lou in the car) to congratulate him and bring over his present but leave shortly afterwards as I don‘t want her to be alone in the car for more than 15 minutes.

He told me that he didn’t like any of these options because his wife didn’t want my 'aggressive dog' on their property, in their driveway or in their neighborhood in general.

I apologized and told him if that was the case, I wouldn’t be able to come at all. 

He has told me he’s disappointed but especially my SIL has been bombarding me with texts about how I was selfish for putting my dog before my brother, and that I was an AH of a sister to do that to him on his 40th birthday.

I think I have proposed reasonable enough compromises (EDIT: and because all of them were declined, I don’t see what other options I have left except for staying home) but in the end, I‘d still like to hear the opinions of unbiased internet strangers to be sure.",0
"i’m (m20) posting this on behalf of my boyfriend (m20). 
——-
Hi Reddit! Let me get to the story. My uncle (m50) came out when he was about 25 (well, he was caught, but it’s the same idea), and the rest of my family decided that they wanted to have nothing to do with him, and he was essentially disowned. His boyfriend (now husband) found accommodation for the both of them, and they lived together, and they’re now thriving. Love that for them.

The relationship slowly was rebuilt between my uncle and the rest of the family, but it was never quite the same (this happens when you pretend you don’t have a certain brother for ten years.) The point is, I know him, and as a kid, he was my favourite uncle (maybe because his presence was associated with Christmas?). 

As I grew up, I would occasionally go and visit him, and he seemed to really enjoy it. My mother (his sister) was indifferent to that, but the rest of my family hated it, because they thought he was ‘corrupting’ me. My uncle seemed to really enjoy seeing me, so I never stopped.

Guess his corruption worked, because I am currently gay. The point is, I used to live with my parents, and my siblings. My boyfriend, Radio, moved in a while ago, and my family have gone out of their way to make uncomfortable remarks him, how he dresses, how he talks; he’s simply never good enough for them. Phone calls with the extended family are even worse.

I kind of told my uncle about the situation a month ago, and he graciously offered Radio and me a place to live, with his husband, for as long as needed, and we took him on the offer. 

Since we’ve moved out, my family has called me every word in the book, and accused Radio of stealing me, and told me they’d cut us out of the family completely, if we continued to choose my uncle over the rest of the family; and it was an asshole move, and we needed to take a joke.

Reddit, I used to think I was in the right, but based on what I’m doing to my family, I feel like I’m a possible AH, so please let me know if I am.",0
"I have split custody for my two sons Diego(12) and Sasha (10) with my ex Josie. About a year after we split up Josie got pregnant with Eva from a one night stand. That guy never stepped up. He's pretty broke so doesnt pay child support and would stop by every now and then when Eva was young but hasnt been seen since she was 4 or 5. I'm pretty good friends with Josie and will invite her and all 3 kids over sometimes when I have cookouts and stuff like that. Through the years ive watched Eva for Josie as a favor here and there. They go to the same school so sometimes ill pick all three of them up and drop them off at Josies on her weeks when she's busy but I have some time.

I dont play a fatherly role though and dont really want to. The other day when I picked them up from school Josie asked me if I want to stay for dinner. We had a nice meal and hung around a while when I go to leave and Diego and Sasha hug me goodbye and say ""bye dad"". Eva also gave me a hug and called me that as well. I figured it was a mixup and go ""what was that Eva"". She goes ""oh sorry..mean to ask if I could call you that now."" I told her Id rather her call me my name. Im not comfortable with that, I dont want that responsibility on me. She seemed sad and I thought that was that, but since then Josie told me im being a real jerk. Saying its not like she's asking for child support from her but I should still let her call me that and be flattered. I dont really like it though and am afraid of future expectations if she gets used to it. AITA for that?

&#x200B;

I want to be clear that the only part I said was ""I'd rather you just call me (name)"" The ""Im not comfortable with that, I dont want that responsibility on me."" was me explaining myself here, I didnt say that out loud to her. I dont personally want to be uncle or some nickname, I feel most comfortable going by my name. I have sibs with kids who call me Tio and I like that just being their thing",0
"I'm 33M (half Filipino on my mother's side), my GF is 30F (white). I have a 2yro son with a good friend of mine (long story, not relevant here), we share custody, but were never really together. 

My GF and son get along great. We have been dating for 10 months. She hasn't met my parents yet because of covid, and they live in another state. 

My mom invited us both to her house for a holiday, and we accepted. Me, my GF and son took a one week trip to Seattle where my mom lives and visited her house one evening for dinner. 

All my siblings were there with their families, everyone met my GF, things were going great. The kids were eating at their own little table (9 cousing all together) and us adults were at another table. 

My mom served the food and we ate. It was mainly Filipino food, but she made very plain side dishes as well (mashed potatoes, plain rice, steamed veggies etc) for everyone to choose, in case someone didn't like the Filipino dishes too much. 

My GF then just said to me ""this foos is gross"". I told her that's really rude and not to say that to my mother. My mom then asked everyone how the food is and we all said it's great, my SIL joked (as she always does) ""way too spicy for me, I better stick to broccoli and rice"", and my GF said ""it's pretty inedible"". 

My mother was hurt, and she called my GF rude and impolite. I agreed. My GF got angry at me and called me an ass. I told her if she wants to act like a toddler, she is free to join my son at the kid table.

"For over a decade, myself and my four best friends have had an annual fishing trip. There has always been a ""no wives, no girlfriends rule"" since the beginning, and no one has ever violated it.

Two years ago, my friend ""Tim"" told the group he wanted to bring his five year old son, to sort of pass the tradition on to the next generation. At that point, only Tim and I had kids, but my daughter was three and two young for fishing. We all supported Tim's idea and made a big deal over the little guy. He had a great time and came last year as well.

My other friend, ""Randy"" has a four month old son now. When the baby was born, Tim gave Randy a children's fishing pole to give to his son on his fifth birthday. So it seemed clear to me that the tradition had evolved to us + our kids, which I'm cool with.

I mentioned to my friends the other day that my daughter was excited for this year's fishing trip and they looked at me like I was crazy. Tim said I shouldn't bring her, and I was baffled. I was super supportive of him bringing his son. This is no different. My daughter is now the age Tim's son was when he first came on the trip.

Another friend brought up the ""no wives, no girlfriends"" rule, which pissed me off. My five year old daughter isn't anyone's wife or girlfriend. I said if they don't want my daughter there, then I don't want Tim's son there. Tim was offended and stormed out. Randy said what I said was uncalled for. I said I'm bringing my daughter and that's that.

I just want to make sure I'm not being an entitled prick. AITA?

Update: I sent this post to my friends, and we talked some more. They ended up apologizing. Daughter is definitely coming on the trip.

I know many people assumed that my friends are sexist and horrible, but they're really not. They were just worried that with daughter there we would have to stay at a hotel instead of the usual cabin and not be able to do as many activities, but I assured them my daughter can sleep without air conditioning as easily as Tim's son and they are going to be the ones having trouble keeping up with her five year old energy.

Everyone apologized for bringing up the ""no wives, no girlfriends rule"" and agreed that was a shitty thing to say. It's all good now. Thank you for your support.",0
"I guess it should be are “we” the assholes, but idk if that’s an accepted acronym here. 

Apologies that the line up is a bit complicated but I’ll try to lay it out as best I can. 

My family is going on a group vacation this summer. We are pooling our resources to rent a nice property on the beach for a week. My husband and I are (unfortunately) taking the lead on planning and organization. 

It will be me, my husband and our two kids, my brother, his wife, and their 3 kids, plus my parents. (Kids’ ages range from 3 to 9). In addition, my sister, her husband and their girlfriend are invited.

We initially only invited my sister and her husband,  but my sister insisted that their girlfriend (who I think they’ve been dating for 9 months or so) be included as well. 

My sister is in a polyamorous relationship and, although my family and I don’t get all of the nuances, we have tried to be understanding. So as a compromise we said that her girlfriend could come, but we asked that everyone  please refrain from any PDA in front of the kids. We were planning to just refer to the girlfriend as a friend of the family. 
My sister was not happy with this suggestion and is now, once again, saying that she will not go on the trip under these circumstances. 

At this point, everyone else is exhausted with the subject and all for letting her exclude herself from the trip. I’m conflicted though. She’s my sister and I obviously love her. But I also think my other family members are trying their best in a touchy situation. 

Are we wrong?",0
"I’m engaged. My fiancée is fat. She was when I met her. I’ve always found her irresistibly sexy. Not looking for commentary or unsolicited advice on this point. 

My fiancée and I sent out save the dates for the wedding. My brother got one, his wife very intentionally did not. 

He got married last year. His wife had all my siblings’ significant others as bridesmaids, whether they were married or dating. Even my (other) brother’s girlfriend who he’d only been with for a few months. I’d been with my girlfriend for nearly five years at that point and everyone knew it was a question of when, not if, we’d get married. 

She didn’t ask my girlfriend to be a bridesmaid because she didn’t want to be constrained to picking a bridesmaids dress available in plus sizes and did not want to have my girlfriend in her wedding photos. 

I’m not speculating. That’s not something I ever could’ve guessed. That’s what she said, in her own words, when we arrived at the wedding to find everyone else’s SOs were bridesmaids but her, and asked what was going on. 

I thought maybe it was a Bridezilla moment and she’d realize how hurtful it was later, but it’s been over a year, and while my brother has apologized again and again for ever having allowed that to happen (why he’s invited), his wife never did at all. Even when it’s been brought up in front of her. 

We’ve only seen them a couple times since the wedding, and my fiancée has tried to forgive and forget, but it’s still uneasy between us because of the singular lens we now know she views my fiancée through. 

My fiancée doesn’t mind grinning and bearing for the occasional family event we have to attend, but I didn’t feel like it would be right to make her spend her wedding day with someone who would ever treat her as less than human. 

We’re having a very intimate wedding, (20 people and 12 are family.) Having that woman there would taint the whole dynamic. That being said, the rest of my family is understandably upset. 

My family, my brother especially, feel like we’re trying to make them choose sides. (In my other brother’s words “Even if that wasn’t your intention, it’s the result, and that’s a real asshole move none of us deserve. *We* didn’t do anything to [your fiancée].” 

I definitely don’t want to make anyone choose sides, and he’s not wrong that they didn’t cause the problem and don’t deserve the fallout. But my wife also deserves a wedding day with only people who love and cherish her.  

AITA for not inviting my brother’s wife?",0
"My boss got real upset with me. Because he'll text me after work and ask me work relevant questions. I.e.what products we have in stock
If so and so check in with me about a project. If we have any deliveries coming. And he does most of this after I clock out.

I don't text him back, at least when I'm off the clock. I don't use my phone when I'm at work. And I don't feel like work should expect me to essentially work. Or answer work-related questions, if I'm not working. But the second I clock in , i'll open the messages and respond to them.
Or I'll go to him if he's available

A stray text every once in awhile doesn't bother me. 
If I got one a week. I would not raise any issue about that. I understand that things happened. But it's just a barrage of texts almost daily.

edit #1 I'm hourly. I clocked in and out. I'm not salary

Edit #2. Love the people that are telling me to put in a time adjustment form. Might just have to.",0
"Okay, so I rent in a townhouse community in the 'burbs well away from the center of town. We have our units where we live, everything else is common area.

I'm an amateur blacksmith in my freetime (strong recommend) and it's an important part of my life. Before I began practicing my craft in my new home last year, I sought and received in writing explicit go-ahead from the HOA, the fire dept, the county, and the city.

About an hour into my first day of smithing in the new house, the next door neighbor same over and threw a fucking fit, insisting that I was in violation of this law, that law, the other law, etc. and told me I was going to be kicked out of the community. I produced my documentation of approval to work and offered to take a break if he needed a nap, had guests, etc. Dude continues to complain, file cease and desist requests with the city, etc etc. All in all, we went back and forth for a while, the HOA hired an arbitrator to try and help us find an understanding, I agreed to limit my blacksmithing to weekends after 10 before 3 (the actual rules are just 'keep it quiet from 10 pm to 7 am, 7 days/week).

He refused to agree to any sort of arrangement where he didn't throw a fit if I smithed. When asked why it was such a big deal, he told me that when he died I'd go to jail for murder because my smithing killed him, I'd regret smithing. I asked further, and he clammed up, arguing ""I don't have to tell you my medical history."" Fair point, I figured, but with nothing more than ""the noise will kill me,"" it's not my problem.

Eventually after a few months of this, I gave up, the stress of the back and forth and his rage was not worth it, and moved on to woodworking. Surprise surprise: same show and dance because I used an axe to split 3 pieces of wood at 2 pm on a Saturday. Basically I told him to pound sand and things quieted down. I've documented everything and kept the HOA board and my landlady up to speed.

This morning I stepped out of my back door to take the dog for a walk with my CHILD. And dude has the audacity to start shouting at us. We're on his property that he personally owns and has privately purchased (he's a renter too, we're on community lawn) and he'll have us kicked out of the community if we ever go beyond the actual steps of my back porch again.

After I cooled off, I reached out to the HOA to verify whether he owned the property and heard back that yes, the property is HOA-owned, and no, he has no ability to kick me out.

Now he's back at telling me that the stress of seeing my dog on 'his property' is going to kill him and I will go to prison for murder when that happens. I'm a terrible human being for refusing to acknowledge his medical issues and insisting on ending his life. Pretty sure it's bullshit.

At this point I'm done and am pursuing an anti-harassment order through the county and seriously considering suing for him to cover my legal fees. Am I the asshole?",0
"For starters I (31f) have two daughters Lila (4f) & Gaia (1f) fake names. I’m a single mum, and I work in the hospital. My two daughters biological dad (34m) and I were married for seven years and together for ten. We got divorced pretty much straight after Gaia was born. I found out he had been cheating on my almost our entire marriage and literally had two children and twin boys on the way with another woman. Feet the divorce he chose not to be in our lives and signed all his rights away to my girls, I have all rights and full custody of them. His eldest and only daughter (5f) was in my hospital. Not going to go into too much detail about that, but because she was here so was my ex husband as well. The hospital has a daycare which is during Gaia is during the day, Lila is at school. Gaia hates new people, and will hysterically scream if they try to pick her up. I was working my shift, and I get a call from the daycare. Gaia was screaming and they couldn’t calm her down, I run up there scared she was hurt. While I was comforting her they told me my ex had tried to pick her up from daycare, they thought it would have been fine as he used to pick up Lila. After 30 minutes of crying, she finally calmed down. I went down and went ballistic at my ex, he had chosen not to be in their lives, he had chosen to sign his rights away. How I might of let him see her if he had asked, but trying to take her from daycare is just wrong. Now I couldn’t work my shift since I had to keep Gaia with me that day since she wouldn’t stop crying if I put her down that day. I worked out, I don’t think he actually went for Gaia. I think he wanted to see Lila, he was a good dad to her before he left us. But he called me an asshole and inconsiderate bitch for not thinking about how much he might be missing his daughters. Is he right? AITA?

Editing to add: We are not in the US, he has no parental rights nor custody. Also going to add, the daycare is relatively laced with who picks up Gaia. I have colleagues pick her up all the time when I’m busy and as he had picked Lila up all the time I don’t think they really saw a problem. Safe to say, it is definitely no longer that way.

Editing again to add: his daughter did not need anything. She had swallowed a magnet and is home safe now.",0
"I get married in a month & I never really grew up with my mum. I knew she left because my dad’s side of the family pressured her & she has tried to contact me / check in on me in bits and pieces over the years but I don’t respond just to avoid drama on my dads side. 
When I was about 6/7 my dad remarried. My step mum was not the nicest person to me growing up, I don’t even call her mum, I call her by her name. It wasn’t until the last 2/3 years that things have been okay and they are not good. They are just okay. 
Fast forward to now as I get married and getting my wedding invites designed I initially skipped out on mothers name on my side of the card. I put my father’s name because I wasn’t sure how to put my mother’s name, I didn’t grow up with mine and I’m not really close to my step mother. I decided to send a sample to my father and ask for his opinion about it too but before I could, he blew up and turned it into a fight and told me I’m disrespecting her. I understand his perspective but I feel like putting her as my mother ( still bearable ) but her parents as my grandparents on the card while I’ve barely met / spoken to them felt a bit unsettling.

"My maths teacher has had a serious problem with me since I entered the
classroom. I've never been rude, cheeky,
ect. I've always said 'please' and 'thank you'
and I thank her before I leave each lesson. I
would also like to think I'm a pretty smart
person and that I'm not bad at maths. Yet
she's always had a problem with me.
I was taking a test the other day and how I
study is through songs, I will put a song on
a loop and will be able to memorize the
notes I've learnt that way. Which sometimes
means I will sing the song in my head to
remember things. Never out loud though. I
was doing this and my maths teacher told
me to stop staring at the paper of the
person next to me. I've never cheated on a
test and I've not intention too, this
happened multiple times during this test,
even when I was looking at my own paper.
Every time I tried saying something she told
me to keep focusing on my own test. I got
pretty pissed, even more so when she
ignored my raised hand for 10 minutes, she
helped others, and even looked at me. It
wasn't a mistake.
Like I said I was pissed, I told my parents
and they sent in a complaint. She ignored it
and failed my test. Her reasoning being I copied the girl beside me. The only times
out answers were the same was when they
were correct. This time I made a complaint,
she took me into her room and said that she
was having a rough time and she was just
taking it out on me and told me how sorry
she was. I did not forgive her, I told her
students come into school everyday always
expected to be happy, and to never have a
problem. I said girls who were on their
period are also told to sit when they have to
use the toilet and overall, between teachers
not caring about our mental health, well-
being and over all, always telling us to be
good, that's the teachers would have to go
through with it too. I said she can't bully a
student for three years and think nothing
will happen. She told me to get the fuck out
of her room until I was ready to be
respectful. 
(I had kept myself calm and composed throughout this discussion)
I haven't come back yet. Most people are
backing me up but a few have said I
shouldn't be so hard on her. I'm starting to doubt myself so, AITA?

Edit!) 
For context this wasn’t a one time thing, this teacher bullied me for three years straight. I was a literally punching bag for her lol

I have a meeting tomorrow which will be with the principal, her, my parents and I. I will update you all then again! 

This is my first time on Reddit so excuse my lack of knowledge:)

UPDATE, 

I don’t know if I’m doing this right so please tell me if there’s another way. 

First I’d like to say I’ve been reading as many comments as possible and I’m so incredibly thankful for the wonderful people who’ve answered. Everyone has been a huge help and confidence boost, even if I don’t answer you THANK YOU SO MUCH❤️

I met the principal alone at first, I had to make a statement about everything. Every little thing that I could remember. Thankful I took on board some ideas of others and it helped. 

While I made my statement she made her own with the vice principal, we were then brought into the principals office together and were told to talk about it. 

I had five girls from my class that waited if they were needed to back me up (they were and were a HUGE help) 

We talked for about an hour, mostly her denying a lot of accusations I said against her. Sadly the incident from a few days ago wasn’t taken into account. The only thing that was acknowledged was what I said. Then it was a he said she said argument. 

After a while my teacher admitted that she “may have taken some anger out on occasions” this time both me and her kept our cool. My parents ended up arguing so much with her we had to take a moment for a break. 

I’m being moved out of that maths class thankfully and I don’t know what will happen to my teacher. For now she’s been send out until this can go on for a further investigation of some sort. 

My teacher offered to make it up and move past it but I didn’t feel comfortable with that. I’m still mad at her but I hope karma will do the job. 

Also to clear up some confusion, I was never hit. “I was used as a literally punching bag” that was a terrible way to say it. I meant emotionally :) 

Any questions I’ll be sure to answer. Once again, thank you everyone! I’ve never felt so free after getting something off my chest 🫶",0
"So at 18 we gave our son his college fund, told him he can do as he pleases with it. He choose to spend if traveling and finding himself over the last two years. He is 20 now and wishes to go to school, and asked us to pay for his tuition. When I asked what happened to the money he told us the above. I said no, and told him if he wants to go to school better get a job. My wife wants to pay it for his future, I said no we did right and he chose otherwise. AITA.

Edit: We did inform him that the money was his to use. Be it for college or w/e. It was his money after all, we set it aside for him. We did explain the intent but he is an adult and he was free to use it as he pleases, just understand the consequences.

Edit: 18 is an adult in my eyes, and old enough to understand actions have consequences. We informed him what the intent was for, and that we would not police him over it. End of the it was his money and he was free to use it he pleases sorry if I did not explain this properly before hand.

Edit: My son knows what I do for a living. That said what I did was exactly what my dad. I also did not use it to go to school I used it as a down-payment on two houses and rented them out, and asked him for help.

My son was free to do the same. He may not have the knowledge or impulse control but he is told enough to know it is okay to ask for help if he is unsure how to use said money or had no idea what to do with his life.

I am not a monster and he knows this. He could have just asked hey I want to travel how can I best go about that. Had he asked I would have let's do x y and z with your money then I would have given some money to travel.

We did the same with his car, he wanted a car we told him to save. When he saved up an amount needed to buy a car, I told him to keep at and we bought him a car. He knows I do not do think solely to be a cruel monster.

He had a bunch of options he choose the worse one, but I was not going to forcely interject my views on him if he did not want to come ask me for help. The fact he did not meant to me he did not want my guidance.",0
"My(30F) husband’s(31M) grandma has been in & out of the hospital since Dec w/health complications from back surgery. For context, this isn’t the 1st surgery or injury she’s had in the 8yrs I’ve been w/my husband, & each time, me, my husband, & my husbands mother have been her care takers (this is NOT my MIL’s mother. My FIL is an alcoholic narcissist who only cares about the $ he will receive when his mother passes). This particular surgery was a more extensive one than any prior. She had a laminectomy & a fusion. She was only in the hospital for 3 days after this surgery despite not being able to walk or use the bathroom on her own. We tried to convince her to enter a rehab facility as my husband & I both work full time, & have a 1yr old & a 2yr old & can’t dedicate time to being her care takers. My MIL doesn’t work, but lives about 30mins from my husband’s grandma & often cares for her other son’s child (our nephew). She didn’t listen & instead heavily relied on my husband & MIL to care for her. She would call my husband at all times of the night & ask that he comes to her house because she was scared/in pain. Initially I was understanding but it put a lot of strain on us because our boys don’t sleep through the night consistently. After about a week she began requesting that MIL stay the night at her house so that she won’t be alone (she wasn’t alone, my husbands sister [19 F] currently lives with her while she attends college to obtain a degree in the medical field). This continued for another few days until we, & her dr were able to convince her to enter a rehab facility. While there, her calls to my husband became more frequent & more dramatic. This is where my frustration began (this was around mid-Jan). I voiced my frustrations to my husband & he shared my frustrations but felt obligated to go when she would call. Finally he told his grandma that he had a full schedule at this point in life & can’t be her caretaker. She went home after 3 days in the facility (against many nurses & doctors’ recommendations). My MIL then began staying at her house again. She was in & out of the hospital about 5 times due to her wound not draining effectively, her growing inability to walk, & her pain level. She was just admitted into the hospital again yesterday & after a couple of tests it was determined that she has an infection in her bones.
Well about 30 mins ago, she had a nurse call my husband from her cell phone and demand on her behalf that he come to the hospital because she woke up and was very scared. I became enraged & told him to inform her that I will not visit her in the hospital for this stay, & neither will our children. I told him that we already have 2 babies & she is acting like the 3rd one that we cannot & will not care for right now. He left for the hospital & like clock work, our 1 yr old woke up (teething is a B). 
So Reddit, am I the asshole?

Edit: 
Thank you  all so much for the advice and for sharing your similar stories. I am so sorry that so many people have experienced a similar circumstance. Because so many people have suggested it, we have tried to convince her to hire an in home caregiver and she refuses. She refuses all help other than help from her family. She’s not ever been a particularly caring woman and I know she would not do this for one of us if we needed it even if she were able. I’ve tried to respond to as many comments as I can but this gained a lot more traction than I anticipated. 

Update: thank you all again so much for your kind words, well wishes, and pieces of advice! My husband and I took the day off yesterday, took the kids to daycare and spent all day together. We had lunch and discussed the best plan of action. He turned his phone to do not disturb and informed his father that he needed to be “on call” instead of my husband. It was just what we needed. We were able to talk uninterrupted and try to come up with a plan. He and his mother are planning to go talk to his grandmother today and tell her what will happen next. They’re going to hire someone to care for her in her home, or she will go to a rehab facility. Those are her only two options. If she won’t choose then they will choose for her. Thank you all again!",0
"When my (30F) husband and I got our first house I became friendly with our neighbour who had two young children, 2 & 3 (they're now 7  & 8) 

Early on I noticed she was stressed, she was working from early to late (I had noticed she was getting home at like 10pm-11pm) 

I started to ""accidentally"" cook extra, I'd bring over Sheppard pies, meat pies, fish pie etc, I'd ""accidentally"" have too many steaks or food that was about to go off and this led to the children just having dinner at ours.


We recently discovered our daughter (3F) has a meat allergy so everything has been swapped to a veggie option, me and my partner have decided it will make life a whole lot easier to make the switch with her - to put it bluntly, I'm not cooking two meals.

We usually avoid soya and just do vegetables, vegetable lasagne, mushroom burgers etc, broccoli and kale mac n cheese.

Well neighbour decided to complain that I was trying to ""convert"" her children who now refuse to eat food she cooks.

So, I've stopped cooking for her.

She apologized and has asked me to cook but she's never appreciated what I've done for her and complaining has just pushed it all over the edge.

My husband thinks I'm being an AH and that she was just being a concerned parent and clearly feels bad about accepting my charity.

Me F26 and my husband M25 got married a year ago, I'm the kind of person that really like celebrating special occasions that are important to me, before my husband and I got married he promised to take us somewhere nice on our first wedding anniversary, and since my wedding was an absolute disaster-thanks to my in-laws (mother in law to be specific) I saw this as a chance to have another special day to celebrate my relationship with my husband, but things have been rough the past few months I'm 5 weeks pregnant and our whole plan changed.

My husband suggested we have dinner at a nice restaurant that HIS MOM picked for us (??) And...recommended, okay now she's trying to get involved this year too, anyways, he showed me pictures and the type of food they serve and asked me to pay, it's an expensive restaurant, I suggested we pick another but he insisted, I agreed and once we got there I found that the menu wasn't there which was weird because I was ready to order, about 15 minutes of my husband stalling, His parents walked up to our table dressed nicly and sat with us, I looked at my husband for an explanation but he avoided me to tell his mom that the food they wanted was ordered ahead, his mom immediately made backhanded comments about my hair,dress, WEIGHT, and didn't stop.

I was literally mad, she and her son started drinking while my father in law started talking to me about ""politics"", the final straw was when she canceled the cake I wanted and replaced it with the one her husband liked, I got up, told my husband to hand me the keys or I was going to walk, he tried to calm the situation that's when his awful mom started talking about me acting inappropriately, she told her son to ""just hand me the keys"" cause she didn't want me to embarrass her.

I left, an hour later, my husband came home, started berating me for overreacting and ruining dinner, I yelled at him what the F was he thinking inviting his parents, he said they paid for it so he had to invite them, started arguing saying that he saw nothing wrong with what he did, he didn't even tell me and argued about how I was being awful to his family, I went to my mom's after he insulted me and I been feeling bad eversince, his mom texted me but I ignored her.",0
"I (18F) am in university studying to be an ESL teacher. I took a class on English grammar, restricted to TESL & secondary English majors, so those studying to be English teachers. On the first day of class we were assigned a group project. We signed up for groups on a Google Doc the class had access to & could edit. I went w/ two people I'd already met; we'll call them Lexi (19F) & Tony (20M), both TESL majors like me. We picked a topic, divided the work, & figured that was that. Next class, professor made us check in w/ our groups. We opened the doc & saw a name we didn't know: Donna (38F). She added herself w/o telling us. We didn't want to be rude, so we let her join. We had to redivide the work; since we'd already split up the content, Donna offered to make the presentation & put our content in there. We all agreed.

Fast forward to the week before the presentation. We met to go over everything. The three of us were there early since we'd just had class, so we started looking over the presentation while waiting for Donna. There were grammar errors & parts that repeated the same thing, which would crowd the slide & we'd be penalized for just reading instead of truly presenting. There were also complicated programs that we were going to use for activities (part of the assignment), but no one knew what they were besides Donna. I kindly suggested we shouldn't just be reading off the slides & we didn't need to explain the same thing over & over — simple present verbs (e.g., I go, we eat, they run) — b/c it's not rocket science. She said just b/c it's easy for me doesn't mean it's easy for everyone. I get that, but this program is preparing you to teach English; you shouldn't be teaching English if you don't get basic verbs. I didn't say that. We brought up how none of us understood the activity. We were genuine in expressing lack of understanding & admitting we don't know everything. (We were groveling.)

Donna said she didn't feel welcome in the group & she'd already spoken to the prof about switching. She said we weren't being mature; we didn't know how to cooperate, & needed to humble ourselves & not think that we know best. She didn't feel like we wanted her in the group (which she added herself to without any communication) & hadn't since the start. She implied we were discriminating based on her age.

With four days left, we had to figure out new activities (she was the only one with the permissions to access/share them, & we didn't know how to use them in the first place) & redivide which slides we were going to present. I felt guilty since I had probably been the least welcoming, so I took it upon myself to make the activities. The day of, the prof told us she wanted to hear our side after class. Donna told her it was based not on age, but MAJOR: she's secondary English, we're TESL. Like her age, it didn't matter at all. Group debriefed after. We agree this is nuts & Donna was wrong for attacking us like that, but we feel bad. AITA?",0
"Some background: I’ve been working on this story for a while and I was sharing some artwork I made with a friend, and I introduced my main villain as: “Orcus, Conqueror of All Realms” just because it sounded cliche and kinda cool and that’s totally something he’d say upon introducing himself. My friend responded to it, saying “more like girlboss, slayest of all queens,” which is obviously just using Gen Z slang in a way that just kinda means he’s cool from my understanding, but a sarcastic way of saying it. All in all, it was in good spirits and we both had fun.

i decided I’d make the joke into a non-canon comic of my own with one of my protagonists saying that, and given that it isn’t normal slang in this fantasy universe, the others would be confused as hell and that would make it amusing. The comic isn’t supposed to be some hugely funny thing, just a thing I enjoyed drawing and I wanted to make my friend happy seeing it in the form of a comic.

so I posted it exactly as I just described, only for my mom to say “it reads super offensive. Like calling someone a girl as an insult. And queens has gay connotations whether or not that was your intention,” followed by “I’m just telling you how it reads online to someone. Like she’s making fun of him by calling him a girl and gay.”

This all just happened about a few minutes ago now, so it’s obviously weighing on my mind. So far, I’ve asked my friends if they found it offensive, and they’ve all just agreed it was a stupid joke and were ashamed in me for such garbage humor (typical. No culture), but they didn’t find it offensive. 

I’m wondering if my mom was right and if deleting it was the best call. From my perspective as of right now, it was just a silly little comment that I wanted to turn into a fun little drawing, and again, I don’t want to offend anyone, so if it’s on me, I’ll make sure to know better for next time.   


also, if any more context or info is needed, I’m happy to make some more edits.

"This is gonna be long so bear with me.

Background: My mom and dad had 2 kids, my sister J (16F) and I (21F), before they got divorced. My mom since remarried a few years after and had my (half) little sister C (7F). I was originally under her custody but left due to toxic behavior from her and stepdad. J followed suit just this year. Recently she came into my dad's place and started arguing with J. I got woken up by the screaming and called the cops on her. She then turned to me and started yelling at me which caused me to have a panic attack. Cops came and called for paramedics for me and then my mom would start crying and apologizing to me. Since then, I've been prone to attacks like that and have been socially withdrawn, barely eating or sleeping. J also blocked her number and cut all contact with her.

The story in question: I was just watching Netflix when I suddenly get a phone call from my mom's house. I found it weird since I didn't block her.

When I picked up the phone, C was on the line.

C: ""Sis? Can you come home? I miss you."" \*sniffs\*

Me: ""C? What's wrong?""

C starts crying on the phone. I felt my chest starting to tighten up.

Me: ""Is mom there? Did she call me for you?""

C: ""Yes.. Please come home.""

Me: ""I'll be right there okay? See you later."" \*hangs up\*

After that call I got super dizzy. My heart was pounding out my chest. I felt like I couldn't breathe and my ears were just ringing. My mom was living relatively close by (5-10 minute walk) and I even puked halfway.

When I got to her house, she greeted me excitedly and C ran to the door to hug me. I tried being joyful in front of her and tried playing with her and her dolls, but I just kept spacing out. I just felt so numb and sick.

I confronted my mom when C was taking a nap and I couldn't help but snap at her.

Me: ""What the fuck was the call about?""

Mom: ""What do you mean? And do not use that tone on me.""

Me: ""You could've just texted me to come by and visit C or called me yourself. But no, you had to have C crying on the phone for me to come over.""

Mom: ""Then how else am I gonna get you to come? You wouldn't listen to me.""

I was seeing red. I felt like my mom just used C to get me to come back. I had a full blown panic attack right then and there and blacked out.

I woke up in the ER and my dad told me that my mom called the ambulance. Later on, my mom texted me that C woke up and watched me get wheeled away. She then said that I was selfish and egotistical, that the call was not a big deal and I didn't need to get so worked up on it and that I scarred C. When I got back home, I overheard my stepdad yelling at my dad on the phone about how I was an asshole for lashing out at my mom and scaring his daughter like that.

Some of my friends think ITA for talking to her that way and others think I'm not due to the toxic track record.

"Me and my husband are in a difficult situation - he is not a native English speaker and I am, but since moving to an English speaking country together, I felt he has expected me to do a lot of his admin. We have been together the best part of 10 years, are ambitious people and have done some awesome and crazy stuff together. We recently had our first child (just under 1 year old) and have had several arguments because he is working 40% overtime whilst starting a physically demanding side project in the gym (which he is likely to be successful with).

I am currently a SAHM and breastfeed, but have been receiving maternity money which will run out this month. I started a business but haven’t had any customers yet. Work will likely pick up in January. I am currently job hunting for an evening shift somewhere local or wfh. Basically we need to pay our bills and my husband is working so much and is unable to get proper rest or spend good time with our baby. So I think I should go to work to give him some time at home. 

When it’s very late at night or early in the morning, when we both are up if I sleep apparently that makes me an AH according to my husband. He is burning the candle at both ends but he expects me to too. I understand his perspective, as we have a lot to do and no one else is going to do it. He thinks I am too emotional. So Reddit, AITAH?

"My (29F) sister (32F) is having a baby this May and so far everything is healthy and going well. My sister has sadly had 4 miscarriages and this is their rainbow baby (I think that’s what they’re called). I love my sister dearly and she’s been trying for a baby for years. My sister and I are best friends and have been ever since we were small. I’ve helped with the baby shower, crib building, (her husband was busy with the military and couldn’t help at the time) making the nursery, and basically all the things. They’re currently keeping the gender a surprise until delivery and will also decide a name then as well.

Well, my fiancé (30F) and I have both decided that we want to be child free as we both like children but we both don’t want any. We do have 2 cats named Squish and Boulder and they’re the best.

Anyways, my sister and her husband took my wife and I out to dinner and asked if we could be the godparents to their child. My fiancé and I were honestly stunned but after a very long and awkward pause I said no, and then hell broke loose. My sister didn’t believe me at first and then started crying and kept asking me “why” to which I told her that my fiancé and I don’t want kids and in the event that something did happen to the both of them we wouldn’t know what to do. I told her that she knows we chose to be child free but she thought I would change my mind if it was my niece or nephew.

I told her that she should choose people who want kids/already have them and she got mad at me and grabbed something from her purse and threw it at me. It was matching godmother shirts for my fiancé and I, and then they both started creating a commotion. Her husband called us selfish and my sister would not stop crying while saying I should know how important this was to her. Well the restaurant eventually asked us to leave, to which we did and my sister has been ignoring my phone calls and texts and I feel terrible. My parents are staying out of it but my brother is saying I should have just said yes. AITA?

Edit: when I say “godparents” I mean that they will designate us as the people who take guardianship over their child if they both die. We would legally be their child’s guardians.

Edit 2: Cat tax is my second post on my profile, the one on the left is Squish and the one on the right is Boulder.",0
"My(16f) little sister(10f), “Anna” has a “business” where she buys her own cookie ingredients and makes cookies that she sells to family members. 

I don’t eat cookies a ton so I don’t buy from her. However, recently I wanted some and didn’t want hers partly because why would I pay when I could make them myself with family ingredients and I also got to eat the dough, and I just enjoy making cookies. 

I made my own batch, ate a few and set the rest out on the family plate. 

When Anna saw she was upset and started crying. My parents supported her and said I was being “unnecessarily cruel” and I could’ve supported my sister. 

They let Anna take the cookies I had made and sell them. 

It was pretty easy to tell which were mine and which were hers, so I just took the ones I had made from her box when I wanted a cookie. Over several days I probably ended up eating most of the batch I made. 

She noticed and got our parents upset with me, and made me pay her, saying I was wrong to “steal” from her. 

I paid because it wasn’t that much but I still disagree with it and Anna is still mad at me(she holds a grudge a long time but she’ll get over it).

"My wife and I are having a disagreement about me sending my parents 2000 dollars every month. To be clear, this is not a financial burden for us at all. We're both attending surgeons, and this money makes absolutely no dent on our quality of life or our savings. Additionally, we don't have joint finances, so, to a certain extent, this should not be her decision at all. I have never told her how to spend any money she's made.

She and I have different relationships with our parents, but she feels that because she doesn't send her parents money, I shouldn't either. Culturally, I am expected to take care of my parents as they get older. She doesn't think I have that obligation, but they invested over half a million dollars in my education alone. She took student loans for both undergraduate and medical school. I didn't.

If she pays back student loans every month, it makes sense for me to pay back my parents, because I feel like I owe them that much. My parents are annoyingly thrifty, and, if I don't send them money, I know they won't actually enjoy their retirement. They've worked too damn hard putting me in a position to succeed for me not to do something for them now.

"Okay, she’s not my SIL yet but I used it to make the title simpler. She’s my boyfriend’s borther’s girlfriend.

I (f28) have been with my boyfriend (m32, Ian) for 3 years. We’ve decided to host a small, early Christmas dinner. One of the people invited was his brother, Jake (m26). Jake asked if he could bring his girlfriend as she was all alone (they’ve been together for 3 months) and we agreed, the more the merrier. His girlfriend, Naveah (f28) seemed a bit timid but lovely. Naveah brought her 8 year old son (that we didn’t know was coming).

She seemed lovely right until she went to the bathroom, she came out shrieking,box of my tampon she in her hand, literally gasping for air in between her shrieks. I could barely understand her. Turns out, my box of tampons was visible (duuuh, it’s within a reach because hey, I need it monthly, why should I hide it and then look for it). She was going off about being disgusting, how could I be so shameless to have this in front of a child and other men and so on.

I looked at her in disbelief, I couldn’t believe she made a scene about a box of tampons, has she never been in a shop?

Anyway, I told her that my tampons stay where they are but if she’s so pressed, she can leave and go home where no tampons are present. She turned red, quite literally, her face was bright pink. Huffing and puffing, she dressed her kid and told Jake to drive her home which he did.

Jake didn’t come back but he called from her house telling Ian that I was the asshole. I was surprised to hear that Ian (my boyfriend) agreed with him. I thought he would be on my side. We were about to argue but I decided it wasn’t worth it and went to my office to cool down and think this through. Am I the asshole for telling her to leave?",0
"I (22M) was just told by my mom that I wasting a special occasion by not celebrating my birthday no matter how small the celebration is. In the past 3 years, I've been noticing that I tend to be the one least enjoying the celebrations itself. 

Three years ago, I already planned with my parents that I wanted to have a small celebratory lunch in hour home with some of my friends but it turned out that my mom invited my extended family that I have barely even talked to. The menu that I asked for was even changed due to the number of guests. It was still fun but not what I really had in mind that disappointed me a bit. 

The following year, mom booked an expensive buffet for my birthday without my knowledge, so I adjusted plans to include lunch at a luxury resort. According to herm she wanted us to ""experience luxury."" However, we just ended up exploring because we realized that the buffet was going to cost us around $250 dollars. Long story short, none of the premade plans I layed out were not made to reality. I planned to go to visit an art gallery, go to the big mall to ice skate for the first time but we ended up going to an IKEA for three to four hours because my mom insisted. I hadn't went there before so I agreed to it since why not? In the end, the day was wasted with dinner in a bad buffet restaurant, everyone fighting, and me crying in a bathroom stall. 

This year my mom booked another buffet in a different 5-star hotel on my birthday itself which was a school day. I blew up on her asking why she didn't let me know before hand and didn't she even consider that I had classes that day. She told me that she can rebook it to a different date but it has to be on the same month so it has to be earlier. I wasn't able to plan anything so I reluctantly agreed to it. The reviews of the hotel was pretty good and it was beside the sea. As an aspiring marine biologist, it would be nice to eat beside the ocean. Before the day came, I was sore from training the whole week that made me cranky. Anyways, we are off to the hotel then mom started to talk about inviting more people with us. I called her out on changing plans last minute like how she did last year. The car ride went a bit quiet then she proceeded chatting with my dad while on the road. We finally arrived at the hotel and it looked underwhelming. What's worse was that the sea was covered with sand to build a mall over it. They even joked about it being a ""sandside buffet."" The trip went sour when I said that I was not enjoying it. My mom started to raise her voice asking me if what she did was not enough for me. People around us were looking. We ended up leaving and going to the same mall to buy equipment for my varsity training. 

Today, they greeted me and asked if I had plans for today. I said no. They asked if I let my team or my friends know. I said no. I just told them I was just going to study for the rest of the day. I also added that I did not want to celebrate today.

"Hi all.

I'm a bit confused by this situation, and I'm annoyed by it, but I'm unsure if my being annoying makes me an asshole. Any perspective would be appreciated.

Some background: I \[F/29\] have known Jake \[M/29\] and Amy \[F/30\] since high school. They've been together since freshman year of highschool (with two break-ups in between) and are having a micro-wedding in July (30-40 guests). I do not particularly care for Jake, or how Jake has treated Amy (he's cheated on her, hence the two break-ups), but she's forgiven him so I suck it up for her sake and be nice to him. My husband, who I have been married to for 5 years now, has known both of them for about 7 years. He feels similarly to myself, in that he doesn't care for Jake but sucks it up for Amy.

Amy asked me to be her Maid of Honor; I accepted. Only after I accepted did she tell me that my husband isn't invited to the wedding at all (neither ceremony nor reception). Originally I was annoyed but fine with this because 1) it's her wedding and 2) her wedding is small for obvious reasons. However. I found out that some of the other bridesmaids are having their boyfriends (not married, some are also just +1s for those who are single/not in a long-term relationship) invited.

When I questioned Amy as to why the boyfriends were invited, but my husband was not, she claimed it was because Jake didn't think my husband treated him fairly at our wedding. For more background, at our wedding my husband had a groomsman drop out last minute due to a family emergency; Jake expected to be asked to fill in since Amy was one of my bridesmaids, and when my husband chose a different person (a cousin of my husband) Jake was offended.

It seems petty that Jake is holding onto this half a decade later, and it feels frustrating that Amy asked me to be her MoH, only telling me about my husbands lack of invite after I accepted. However, it is her wedding, and I can't/shouldn't try to control what she or Jake chooses to do or who to invite.

Still, I'm feeling frustrated and am second-guessing whether or not I want to remain her MoH because it just feels a bit...shitty? That they're not inviting my husband for some petty grudge that happened at our wedding 5 years ago, but are okay with inviting potential randos? Am I wrong for feeling the way that I do?

I've discussed the situation with friends who are not friends with Jake & Amy; some think that I'm justified in being annoyed/dropping, other's are telling me that it's their wedding so they can choose to invite who they want, just as my husband chose to have his cousin be a groomsman instead of Jake.

**tl;dr: I agreed to be a MoH and was only told afterwards that my husband was not invited to the wedding. Others are allowed randos/+1s, with my husband not being invited due to a somewhat petty grudge the groom-to-be has against my husband. I'm considering dropping out due to this.**

**Edit 1: I've pretty much been flooded with NTA's and have been told to stand up for myself and my husband, so I'm going to drop out. Neither my husband, nor myself, deserve the bull they're peddling, and I need to make it clear that my husband is more important than some ridiculous petty grudge.  I've tried to talk to Amy about Jake several times about my concerns but she's blown them off every time. I care about her and love her very much, but she's not returned the same friendship looking back. Guess that was indicative of a bigger issue at hand. Thank you all for your help; I'll update later after I get ahold of Amy.**",0
"I got in trouble at school this fall, I'm a junior in high school. 

(Edit to add what I got in trouble for since a couple people asked... I smoked weed with a guy in the woods after school once and got caught. I also made out with him a couple times and my parents found out about that too)

As punishment my parents took away a lot of my things; all my clothes except 3 pairs of plain jeans and 3 plain black shirts and my coat. And all my makeup and hair stuff, purses and shoes; saying I had to earn things back with good behavior, I don't get to engage in my hobby (fashion) till I've earned it.

Anyway it was a shitty couple months but I came to a couple realizations.

It was actually kind of nice to not have to think about what to wear and how I look.  My friends knew what my parents had done and didn't judge me. I also told anyone who asked why I looked like I only had one outfit what was up and it was no big deal.

I know it was supposed to be a demeaning humiliating punishment to make me look bad at school but honestly it just makes them look bad when people at school know I'm only allowed to wear one thing.

I don't want to have things that are just something someone else can hold over my head. I don't want the old clothes and makeup back, if I'm gonna get back into that stuff I'll do it on my own terms; I'll buy my own stuff.

So I told my parents that I don't care if they keep the clothes and makeup; they've made it clear that stuff doesn't belong to me. And it's gross to me to spend every day wearing clothes that aren't mine, that can be given and taken as punishment. I'd feel gross and I'd rather not wear them again.

So now my parents are mad because they've got a lot of clothes boxed up in the attic that the family spent money on and that are going to waste. Nobody else can wear them; my mom isn't my size and my only sibling is my little brother.

I said I don't care, I want clothes that are my own and those aren't it. 

AITA for not taking the clothes back and letting them go to waste?",0
"Her classes are all remote, through zoom, dont even need a webcam on just log on to the class so the teacher sees your name there and checks it off. But I guess that was too much for her, and she would rather sleep all day instead. Shes missed the past two weeks straight, the university policy is if you miss two weeks of classes you get dropped(I know, I go there too).

So of course yesterday when she tried to log on she found she was dropped, from everything. She was distraught because she thought she was going to get in trouble with mom and dad.  Honestly I was worried they would kick her out with how they'd been talking when I started going a few years ago ""if you drop out you gotta find a new place to live"" and all that. While I dont feel bad for her getting dropped from the classes, I wouldnt want her to be homeless. 

Instead of being upset, mom and dad just tried to comfort her. Telling her lies about how its not her fault, the school was too harsh. I was planning on keeping my feelings to myself, but mom kept bugging me asking for me to try and help make her feel better. After the 7th or 8th time that night I snapped and said my peace. Saying how ""she knew the schools rules, we all were well aware of them, but  shed rather sleep all day than go to class for the past two weeks. So no I refuse to feel sorry for her that her own actions caught up with her. You said if I ever did anything did anything like this I'd be kicked out! But now you're just coddling her""

Mom said the pandemic has been hard on us all, and that it should be understandable if people dont have the energy to go to class. I said I would agree, but sis has some how found the energy to go to very un safe house parties each and every weekend since the pandemic started, including the two she skipped class, putting everyone in the house at geater risk. But some how she doesn't have the energy for school?

Mom and sis aren't talking to me right now, dad is torn on who to side with.

EDIT: yes mom and dad know my sister parties, mom is afraid her missing out on a year or two of dating and socializing will lead to her being single forever.   I am engaged already, before you ask.

EDIT 2: Just to reiterate, I didnt say ANYTHING until mom pushed and pushed and pushed me to. Also, far as I've been told im the only one in the family diagnoses with depression",0
"My husband has 2 other kids from a previous relationship 9 & 17. We have 2 children together 8 yo & 8 mo old baby. 
My husband recently got a promotion which requires him to be on call 1 week out of the month. I work from home and am the primary caregiver for both of our kids.
Our 8 yo recently switched to a different and better school, which happens to be minutes away from my stepdaughter’s school. Upon switching he asked if I could now take his daughter to school when he is on call and I agreed. Normally, she is dropped off with her mother very early in the morning and her mother handles the drop off, daycare, etc. 
Im very inclusive with 4 kids when it comes to parties, Christmas, birthdays, etc. I cook and clean for them but leave homework, showers, discipline, etc to my husband as I don’t feel this is my place.
Today is the 4th day of school and my husband asked if I could take his daughter to school. I assumed that nobody was available to take her since he said when nobody was available in our previous conversation. I think it’s important to know that Both the 8 & 9 year olds start school at the same so this is a problem. I said I would try it anyway. But in doing so, it became very hectic trying to get both kids ready at once, feeding them breakfast, getting the baby ready, etc. Ended up leaving 8 minutes later than planned so my step daughter was on time and my son was borderline late/running to class. So I told my husband I couldn’t take her every day and questioned why I had to when her Mom was home. He said I left too late & started saying things like “I didn’t know it would be such a big deal to help me out” & “sorry my children are such an inconvenience for you.” Etc. I explained that shes not an inconvenience, but has a perfectly ready and available parent to take her, it was hard getting everyone ready on time, the kids were playing and not getting ready, plus the baby, all of it. I reminded him that when we spoke, he said emergencies and when nobody was available but her Mom called her this morning to tell her to have a good day and where to be picked up so this wasn’t the case today.  I told him his children are his responsibility and he cant get upset when I cant take responsibility for them as well as my own children and that it wasn’t fair to expect that. 

I cant help but wondering if this was his plan all along- to move my son schools and then assign me to carpool without even communicating- especially since he doubled down and was saying his kids were an inconvenience and trying to guilt me. If the situation had been fully communicated, I would have said no. My schedule is crazy enough trying to manage the house, my job, and an 8 month old while working. 
However, I cant help feeling like an asshole. If they we’re being dropped off at the same school, it wouldn’t be a problem. Our son was late, and it was just too much. 

So Reddit, AITA??",0
"One of my very close friends Nathan (29M) and I (28M) met during our first post-college job at a prestigious finance firm, and we immediately bonded over the long work hours, shitty middle management, and general soul-sucking nature of making PowerPoint slides and Excel sheets all day. For the next few years, a lot of our friendship revolved around us talking about work and how much we hated it.

A few years ago, I decided that I just couldn't take the corporate grind anymore, and I quit my job to move into the nonprofit world. While I now certainly make less than I would have at my old job, I'm exponentially happier, healthier, and absolutely love the work that I do. I also still make a very good salary ($80K/year) which I feel is more than enough money for me and my needs. Nathan has been ambitiously climbing the corporate ladder, and recently became a VP at his firm. He makes well over $300K a year.

Nathan grew up in a very poor family, and his relatives are still financially unstable and often ask him for money. I, on the other hand, grew up in a comfortable upper-middle class suburb with parents who have always been financially stable. They're not millionaires, but if anything ever happened to me, they could (and would!) help me until I could get back on my feet. Nathan does not have that privilege.

I recently got offered my dream job, where I would be making slightly less money than I am now ($75K/year). Despite the money, I am genuinely giddy about this job prospect, and was pumped to tell my friends. However, when I told Nathan, his response was ""I'm glad you have the financial privilege to take a pay cut."" Not ""wow AncientMesopotamia, I know you've been really wanting this job for months now and have told me all about how excited you are about it, congratulations!!!!"" or anything along those lines. I'll admit that I snapped back at him and told him that he makes triple the amount of money I do, and that at some point he needs to realize he's now got privileges of his own instead of pointing out mine. The conversation got a bit heated, and we agreed to hang up and cool off before talking it over later.

Now I'm wondering if I should apologize to Nathan for what I said, or if I should stand my ground. I'm feeling angry and a bit defensive, which I realize is exactly the reaction that a spoiled rich kid would have. However, I also do think it was a bit mean of him to say that at that exact moment when I was so excited. And while generational wealth does give privileges that income alone does not, he literally does make over triple the amount of money that I now make, so it seems a tiny bit hypocritical for him to be calling me privileged.

Also, as a final note, while my parents certainly are well off, they do not support me financially in any way, and have not since I graduated from college 7 years ago.

So, I leave the judgement to you all - AITA?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT - Woah, this really blew up in a way I wasn't expecting. I've spent hours reading as many comments as I can, and I thank each of you for your perspectives - I have really learned a lot about privilege and what it's like to grow up poor from some of your stories. While it is nice of many of you to say that I'm not the asshole, I do think I approached Nathan's situation with a lot of ignorance and potential assholery.

u/Equivalent_Joke_9617 said it best:""I don’t think it matters who’s ‘more right’ here. What matters is whether Nathan has been a good friend and one that’s worth keeping. If the answer is yes, a heart-to-heart talk should sort this out.Genuine adult friendships are hard to come by. Don’t let a misunderstanding ruin it!""

Nathan's been my buddy for years, through thick and thin, and so I called him back up to apologize. I mentioned that I really didn't know what his experience had been like, and that I was so proud of him for all he's accomplished, and that I just felt a little hurt and unsupported when he called out my privilege from the get-go instead of being happy for me. It felt like he was minimizing my success, but it turns out he's just been having a tough time at work and didn't respond in the best way to my job news. He apologized too and we had a really nice conversation. I think that since we started our careers at the same place and time that it's easy for us to compare ourselves, and we're both guilty of the competitive comparison game with each other. Anyway, it's all good now and I think we've opened up a good dialogue where I can learn more about my buddy's past and what it's been like for him, and try and support him with some of the mental struggles of coming from poverty. Listen to u/Equivalent_Joke_9617 and have heart-to-hearts with your friends and learn from your mistakes!

Also Nathan and I will be going to a baseball game next week and he offered to buy the tickets because he's ""loaded"" and I'm a ""non-profit schlub"" (both his words, both said with love). ",0
"I’ve been in a committed relationship with my husband for 17 years, and overall, things have been great. We’ve had a few rough patches, but what’s important to note is that while he earns more than me and is considered the main provider, I have a substantial trust fund that ensures we’re financially stable. I work part-time as a teacher while attending university, earning less than him, and most of my income goes towards tuition. Our household income exceeds $200k annually, while the average in our area is below $50k.

One ongoing issue we have is my husband’s frugality. He likes to control my spending and have the final say on how he uses his earnings. It’s worth mentioning that I’ve never used any of his income and have no intention to do so.

However, the main point of contention between us is his frequent visits to food banks. Despite having more than enough food at home, he insists on going to food banks to save money. He intentionally looks disheveled and uses our beat-up car to blend in, even though he’s never experienced food scarcity. I’ve explained to him the need for food donations in our community, even showing him social media posts from local food banks, but he remains indifferent. I suggested he volunteer or donate to gain firsthand experience, but he refuses. The unfortunate part is that since we’re never short on food, most of what he brings home ends up getting thrown away.

Today, I discovered our fridge filled with fresh produce and meat that clearly didn’t come from our regular grocery store. When I confronted him, he admitted to going to a food bank after seeing a Facebook post about a donation of fresh food. People on social media were already asking if any was left, and there wasn’t. I showed him these comments, but he brushed them off, claiming people should have gone earlier. Exhausted by the situation, I packed a bag and went to stay with my brother for the weekend, asking for space to think things over.

My husband accuses me of overreacting, being vindictive, and threatens to go back to the food banks regardless of my feelings. His family is also messaging me, calling me an asshole and urging me to stop interfering with his choices. I turned off my phone, but now they’re bombarding my brother with messages. Thankfully, he supports my decision and ignores them.

All I want is to enjoy the rest of my week without being angry at my husband. Yes, I could let this go and not scold him, but the food he takes could have gone to people who truly need it. I’m not leaving my husband, but I need a few days away to gain some clarity. Am I wrong for wanting this space?",0
"
I am a 32 year old mother of a seven year old boy. His father, my husband, died when he was four. My son has been traumatised ever since. We slowly got back on track but money has been extremely tight ever since.

About half a year ago I was approached by a friend of a friend. They wanted a baby but couldn’t have one. They wanted me to be their surrogate. I immeadiately declined because I did not feel like I could handle it emotionally. When I said no they offered me more money. So much in fact that I felt like I had to say yes. The money would have made my son’s and my life a lot easier so I accepted. We drew up a contract and signed it a month ago. The procedure was meant to start in early August.

But then last week I was offered a promotion. I was offered this promotion once before but it was so close to my husband’s death that I did not feel like I was ready for the extra responsibility and the move that comes with it. But now I feel ready. It and it comes with a serious pay rise too. I accepted. That also means that I won’t need the money that would come from being a surrogate. I decided I would no longer be willing to do it. I never really wanted to in the first place.
So last Saturday I met up with the couple and explained my situation. I told them that I had accepted the promotion and I would be moving away in September. They did not take it well. They accused me of leading them on and said I should have discussed the promotion with them first. They said they will pay me even more if I agree to go through with the pregnancy. I said no my mind is made up. They were very upset and said I already signed the contract. I am pretty sure that they cannot make me do anything I don’t want despited the contract.

I feel bad about backing out and I expected them to be upset. At the same time it’s a very big thing and I really do not want to do it especially now that I don’t need the money anymore. I also, maybe selfishly, want to take this promotion. After all I went to uni for 5 years to get a Masters degree and I want to progress in my career.

I’m starting to doubt my desicion though because the couple keeps messaging me. They say they are willing to double the money. I don’t want it but I feel bad because they seem very desperate and I ruined their hopes.

"Firstly sorry this is on mobile and throwaway.

I (F32) emigrated to my husband’s (39) home country 5 years ago and we have a beautiful son who is 3. 

My mother (52) has always been controlling and frankly is a typical narcissist. She was dead against my moving and was even more upset when I had my son as a combination of her husband being terminally ill and the pandemic she wasn’t able to meet my son until this week and she has complained bitterly how we “cheated” her out of her special time with her first grandson. 

I wasn’t exactly excited about her coming to visit us but my husband convinced me we should try to let our son have a relationship with her. Well from the moment she arrived she complained - our house is too small, the garden is over looked etc. She complained my son doesn’t speak much english and so she can’t communicate with him. She complained that my son didn’t want to hug her, that he wanted to stay with his paternal grandmother.

My son spilt a drink and she shouted at him. We are taking the gentle approach so I told her not to do that and why and she lost it telling me I have no idea how to raise a kid. I told her she needs to respect my methods or she can leave. She stopped but the whole rest of the day you could tell she was furious.

That night my son was having one of those nights where he just isn’t going to sleep through. My poor husband also had an IBS flare up in the early hours and we realised we had no medication.

When my son settled at around 7:30am I decided to do a quick run to the 24hour pharmacy to get some medication. Leaving son and husband both asleep on the sofa.

I was gone for 20mins but when I came back my mother’s rental car was gone and so was my son while my husband was still asleep. He was as shocked as I was they had gone.

Tried my mother’s mobile but no answer. After 45mins of me becoming increasingly hysterical I called the police who came out very fast and when I explained as above took things seriously.

6hours later my mother pulled back up and started telling the police (most adults know english here) that I had told her she could take my son out for the day, I am currently 6 months pregnant and she said it must be pregnancy brain which the police seemed to accept and acted like the matter was closed since my son was home safely and showing everyone the toys he been bought. 

I told my mother to leave and that I never want to see her again. She started telling family I kicked her out for no reason and she can’t find a hotel and they blew up my phone to which I told them she had kidnapped my son and I am going to pursue this with the police.

Now I am being called an a-hole for saying my son was kidnapped when he was “just taken on a day trip by his loving grandmother” and that a accusation like this could affect my mother’s job as a nurse.

Edit - lots of people saying my husband shouldn’t have pushed for this meeting. You are right but I don’t think he was wrong. He didn’t force me to agree to it, I ultimately had the final say. 

And I get it he is (we are) lucky his parents are amazing so despite knowing my mother isn’t great he didn’t want our son to miss out. We expected some snide comments and awkwardness but were ready to ignore that for our son. Since my mother’s normal weapon of choice is nasty comments he wouldn’t understand so if we kept smiling he wouldn’t know.

I feel grief that my son is going “miss out” on having another grandmother but she made her bed.

Edit 2 (holy s**t is this real life) So she is now trying to change the narrative to “I did not kidnap your son but also if you think your husband could just sleep through an abduction then your marriage is a sham/how could you be so reckless to leave your child with him@

I can not even with this.


Update (of sorts) thank you everyone for the support. It seems maybe I got a bit lost in my translation (emotional and the police spoke native language and very fast with strong accents) the case isn’t exactly dropped. 

They have spoken to my mother and basically told her not to approach the house or they will consider it a threat/harassment and will act while they “continue investigating” but they feel her leaving the country tomorrow is enough of a resolution (apparently she has shown ticket info).

I am still getting a lot of grief from family saying I should understand my mother is struggling after her husband died and so on….this again is making me question my reaction but I can’t forgive this. 

I will reach out relative embassies but I feel like nothing will happen. 

My partners family are being amazing and looking after us all.",0
"I (f17) asked my sister (f18) if she wanted to get breakfast at this really good place by our school. She was on the phone with her bf (m17) and we're friends so I invited him too. He said that he wanted to but he lost his job a few weeks ago and couldn't afford to get breakfast. I told him I'd buy his breakfast and he took a while to convince him but he eventually agreed.

We got to the place and when we were paying I put enough for my food, the bf's food, and like $3 for tip (our food was $14 so it was around a %20 tip) and my sister said that wasn't enough. I checked the bill and we both got hash browns and eggs for $6 and he got a $2 coffee so I know I paid enough. My sister said that she expected me to pay for her food too (3 pancakes, fruit salad, and a hot cocoa, $18) because I offered to pay for her bf.

I told her there was no way I was paying for her food especially since it was more than mine and her bf's combined. She got mad and said that i can't just pay for one person and not the other and the bf and I argued that it's my money and I could pay for whoever I want. My sister screamed that she wouldn't have ordered that much if she knew I wasn't paying and went home. I ended up paying the entire bill and my sister's bf drove me home. I told our mom what happened and she transferred the money from my sister's bank account into mine and texted her a long ass paragraph about how rude and entitled she was being.

My sister and her bf are fighting now because of that and he's considering breaking up with her because of it so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.

Edit: I wanted to add some things

1. My sister's bf and I have been close friends for 4 years (he's been dating my sister for 2 months) and we always do shit like buying each other's movie tickets or meals so I really didn't think anything of it.
2. My sister and I never pay for each other unless it's one of our birthdays so idk why she expected me to pay this time",0
"My moms friend (39F) who we’ll call K came over today with her son(3M) who we will call A.everything was fine until A started throwing a tantrum he asked to play on my phone when I said no he instantly started sobbing. I looked at K for some help but all she did was laugh and say “just let him cry he’ll get over it soon.”
I was annoyed but let it slide since I didnt
 want to question her. After A finished his tantrum k instantly started talking about how ill be having children soon and i should start babysitting A for FREE. I shut down that quickly and said “ thank you but i don’t think  it will be that soon.” She immediately got defensive and started to rant about how “young girls like you don’t  care about children they only care about sleeping around”
After that things got  very awkward and my mom told me I was incredibly rude and I am now grounded. So AITA?",0
"So my daughter (12F) is literally in love with roblox, she plays it everyday with her friends any chance she gets. Obviously my wife and I aren't happy with this, but she does well enough in school, and has her priorities straight when it comes to education.

One day my daughter came crying to me that her account got hacked by someone on roblox, and that she lost her entire account. I was freaking out because I let her use my CC on the game to buy things   (I was with her while she purchased the items). I did some research, and realized that the game doesn't save CC information, so I calmed down, helped her make a new account (I asked her if she wanted to reset the password by going thru the email, but she said she just wanted a new account), and all was fine.

A couple days ago, the bank had let me know that there was an enormous amount of strange transactions occurring at odd times during the day (@ like 3AM-6AM, the amount of money spent was $1200 damn dollars), and I had to go through a long and tough process of having to change my CC info, and freezing my account for the time being.

I asked my daughter if this was in anyway related to her roblox account being hacked, and she said no because ""how could they if the game itself doesn't save the CC #?""

I was fooling around on the ipad browsing youtube, when I saw a bunch of recommended videos like '\*FREE ROBUX\* How to GET 1 000 000 ROBUX', I went through her history and found all these third party shady sites, and how she had been putting her account info onto it.

I also went in to the hacked account by going through her email and resetting the password to find that she had been taking fucking pictures of my CC and the CVV number on the back and asking her friends how to enter the information to use the CC, she had also sent our street address and our postal code.

I absolutely blew up when I saw this, I ran up to her room and gave her probably one of the sternest lectures I have ever given as a parent. I told her that I couldn't believe she lied to me, she cried and told me she was sorry repeatedly.

I blocked all access from the internet on the iPad, and told her she will no longer be allowed to use anything internet related except for school. I blocked the roblox website itself, and left it at that. She can no longer use the internet for the time being, but I still allow her to watch TV, talk on the phone with friends, and if she asks, she can go into facetime calls with her friends.

My wife says I need to relax, and that I need to undo this punishment immediately since ""I never taught her the danger's of privacy over the internet"" and ""because there's nothing else for her to do during social distancing"". The thing is, yes, I somewhat agree with that, but she lied to my face about something that was extremely serious, and she went through my wallet to get my CC without my knowledge. I just can't let it go. AITA?",0
"My job does an annual benefits review where they evaluated our current benefits and took suggestions for new benefits. This was done in small groups to have an open discussion. We are an office of about 35 people. We can't really work from home a lot because in person collaboration is needed. I like my job a lot. I've (M35) always kept it on the down low I hate dogs. If I tell someone I don't like them I usually get a ""whats wrong with you?"" from people.  
  
  
I was in the final group to have a discussion. The topic of a dog friendly office came up. They said this was likely to be implemented based off the feedback so far. They'd test this out with a few Fridays before fully implementing it. I spoke up against this. I explained my reasoning, Said it would be a terrible idea, and if implemented i'd re-evaluate my employment here.  
  
  
This is now unlikely to occur and everyone is blaming me. It seemed like this was something a lot wanted. My co-workers and I went to a happy hour and I got the cold shoulder from many of them.   
 Even received some drunken comments that happy hour. I've even had a few ask me to change my mind, apparently being able to bring the dog in would save them a lot of money from walkers/boarding etc. I've maintained my stance to my co-workers and have been called selfish and ruining it for other.  I just want nothing to do with dogs in our office. AITA?

"So, a couple of weeks ago I (M35) had my sister (F39) and her family (including Niece, F11) over for a barbecue. We had a pretty good time, with the exception of Niece who was pretty much constantly on her phone recording tiktoks. Slightly annoying but ultimately not my kid, not my problem.

I've talked to my sister a while ago about being careful what Niece is putting online, protecting her identity etc. My sister brushed it off, saying that Niece was sensible enough not to do anything stupid. I figure I'd try and bridge the gap, so I ask Niece what she's recording, ""It's a tiktok, you're old, you wouldn't get it"". I work in tech, so it's not like I don't know what I'm talking about, but I decide to let it slide and do some digging later.

Turns out Niece has used her full government name to register for Tiktok, with links to her public instagram with the same name, so I did what any reasonable person would do - reported everything for being under 13. Instagram, Youtube, Tiktok, everything I could find. With the nature of tiktok trends, some of the stuff on there was stuff that 11 year-olds probably shouldn't be doing, and definitely shouldn't be recording.

Fast forward to today, Sister calls me and asks me if I can have a look at Niece's ipad. Apparently she can't log into any of her accounts and she's having a meltdown about it. I talk her through it and it quickly becomes apparent that the accounts are blocked and asking for ID. I'm in two minds whether to tell her it was me that reported the account or just tell her to submit the ID knowing it'll get Niece permabanned.

So, AITA for nuking my nieces social media?  


EDIT: Thanks for your advice, seems like most people are with me on this. I'm not going to tell her it was me, I'm assuming she'll probably create new accounts and if those come up I'll speak to her mum.  


There were a couple of bits a few people mentioned, so I'll add them here rather than copypaste a load:  


""you banned her government name, she'll just use a pseudonym"" - Good. It's one less thing people can use to track her down, and one less thing someone can hold over her if something goes wrong. I'm not stupid enough to think this will stop her, but maybe she'll start to understand that she needs to be smarter about it.  


""She's not your kid to parent/You should have spoken to her mum about it"" - True, and one of the reasons why I questioned if IWTA. My sister is great in many ways, but tech isn't one of them. I tried it the reasonable way, I probably overstepped but I don't think removing someone from a dangerous situation is a problem.  


""You're invading her privacy"" - She's 11, posting stuff publicly under her government name. If you think any of that constitutes ""privacy"", I don't know what to tell you.",0
"For background I was with my ex ""Meg"" for 13 years. We did not get married because both of us got married young before and decided marriage wasn't for us. Her son ""Eric"" is 18 and a senior in high school, finalizing where he'll be headed for college very soon. Eric's dad has never been in the picture and I played somewhat of a fatherly role but always made sure to build a boundary (He calls me by my first name, told him Im not his replacement dad all that). I have a son and she played a stepmom role for him but not to the degree since my ex is still very much a mother and we split custody.

We broke up in June over some irreconcilable differences and Ive since moved on. In the past I figured Id help pay for Erics college assuming Id still be with Meg but never promised or set up a fund or anything like that.

Now that he's getting to the point of deciding where to go Meg asked me how much I'm going to contribute, which just shocked me. I thought it was common sense that I wouldn't pay for college for someone who's not my kid and who's mom Im not with. Then Eric called me and asked the same thing to which I basically told him, the same thing. Then they both got mad at me and called me some names making me doubt myself

\----------------------------------------------------------------------

People have asked if she is paying for my son. He is doing ROTC and got a full scholarship through that program.

I did not Promise to pay for his college, there was just kind of an understanding that we handled bills as a household

We did not live together the whole 13 years, we did for about 8. From ages 10-17. I do travel for work often and work heavy hours, so I wasn't always around though.

**This got a bigger reaction than expected. If I knew it would I would have added more details like how I didn't meet him for 3 years, travel for work most of the time when I dont have my son, and others. But seems like I'm not the crazy one for not expecting to pay for college. Most people are on my side for that. I know its hard for some people to believe that someone could not form an intense bond with a kid they live with. Not sure what to say other than thats how it went. My son means everything to me and with Eric I tried to be a good role model it just wasn't that type of relationship.  A lot of my friends who've dated people with kids feel the same way about their SO's kids. I think its just one of those things that people are afraid to say out loud for fear of being judged.**",0
"I want to start this off by saying that I think I’m probably in the wrong here. 
One of my (22f) best friends (29f) was showing me pictures of her niece (3f). We had both been drinking and this was the first time she ever said her entire first name. Up until this point, I had only heard her nickname used before. The name is shockingly bad and I laughed out loud at it. My friend asked why that was funny and then I realized that she was not only serious but also really liked the name. 
When we were both sober, she again brought it up and said she wanted her child to have the same name. She isn’t pregnant but I still gave my two cents on it and told her that the name isn’t just bad, it’s almost laughable. She got really upset and said that it was a beautiful name and felt disrespected that I was acting so hostile. I guess I could have been nicer about it but I still think it needed to be said. So, am I the asshole?

I am a full time law student, and a part time beauty blogger. I have actually gained a significant following on my instagram during quarantine, so off late I've been getting a lot of sponsorships and deals with startups. Nothing too big, but I'm making money off it.

Now coming to my childhood and personal life, it has always been a mess. My dad married my mom on the rebound and cheated on her through out the relationship with my ex stepmom. (They divorced this year). 

My mom and dad finally got divorced when I was 7 and my brother was 4.  Now what we found out this year is that our stepdad is actually our biological dad (something I already suspected) Adding to the mess is the fact that our stepdad is my dad's adoptive brother. My dad was adopted as a baby by my grandparents, who are Middle Eastern.

My mom is the most basic white chick ever, and so is my dad with ginger hair and pale skin. We came out with dark hair and dark eyes. So yeah. My younger brother and I look really similar and we get a lot of attention because of the way we look.

The paternity revelation caused a lot of upheaval in the family, but me and my brother weren't surprised because it was something we had always suspected. We also love our stepdad so it's not like we were traumatised. My dad also sired a love child (my older half sister) with ex stepmom while still married to mom. You get the point, there is no innocent party in the mess my parents made.

Anyway, so I did this Instagram live Q and A session with my followers, where this one kid asked me to drop my skincare routine. I honestly take very little care of my skin. I just drink lots of water and keep myself hydrated. When I told her that she asked me the secret behind my ""beautiful golden-tan glow"". At that point, I replied "" I honestly dunno, it's in my genes. Gotta thank mom and dad for that"".

Later I got a call from my dad saying that he was really hurt by my comment when he was actively battling this devastating news. I apologized for hurting his feelings, but also asked him to seek therapy to deal with the news, because that was our reality.

He disconnected the call. My half sister is really angry at me for my comment, and thinks that I was insensitive with my ""therapy"" advice.

AITA?


Edit : My brother was 4. Older Half sister was 8 years old when my parents divorced.",0
"Had to start with AITA, but I guess it would be are WE the assholes.

All names are fake. All people are mid 30s to late 40s.

I belong to a group of about 50 people who are friends/hang out regularly. It started as a fairly large group of college friends, and then grew to include significant others and new friends. We have a discord for the group where people chat and set up get togethers. There's about 10 people who regularly make dinner/concert/movie/party/etc plans and another half dozen or so who do it semi-regularly. I am not an original member of the group, tho I've been around a long time and I am one of the people who plans stuff a fair bit.

A couple of years ago, my friend Zoe started inviting a couple she'd know a few years ago (Annie & Ash) to join us. We didn't know this until recently, but Zoe's wife Zelda wasn't wild about Annie (who has an over the top personality) and REALLY doesn't like Ash (for reasons I'm still unclear on). It appears that part of why Zoe introduced the rest of us to Annie & Ash was so that she could go out and have fun with Annie & Ash while Zelda would have plenty of other friends to hang out with.

Personally, I like Ash a lot, and get on with them pretty well (or I did?). Annie can (to me) be loud to the point of obnoxious, so I stick to small doses of Annie. 

Since they became a part of our group, they've introduced 3 other couples into the group. All of them have SUCKED, each in a different way. One of the couples actually got us thrown out of a bar AND a restaurant (two separate nights out), due to their fighting. None of us have EVER been thrown out of a place, and we were all fucking furious.

After the last dinner disaster with couple #3 (there were about a dozen people there total), several of the people got on the Discord, angrily shared the situation, and then said that they don't want Annie & Ash inviting anybody else into our group. When this was suggested, everybody else in the group either agreed with that, or said nothing about. Nobody disagreed. I think even the people who would be way to non-confrontation to suggest that were over all this recent drama.

Additionally, unbeknownst to Ash & Annie, a couple people started a private chat discussing if they even want Ash & Annie around anymore. I'm not in that group, but I heard about it from someone who is in it.

Ash & Annie are super-pissed and are basically questioning ""what kind of people we are"" because of what is going on. Zoe (the person who started inviting them to stuff), is 100% on board with them not inviting more people, and is feeling really embarassed about her role in thinking they'd be cool people.

So, would we be the assholes if we told Ash & Annie that they absolutely cannot invite any more of their other friends to join us? If that means they stop hanging out with us, it seems like everybody is fine with that too. We just don't want the drama anymore.

Edited to answer some things people keep asking:

-Discord is kinda like a private chat where people can have lots of individual conversations about whatever they want.



-There are about 50 people who are a part of this group. It started with way fewer and then new friends, significant others, friends of friends all got added over time.



-We don't all do everything together. Someone will say ""hey, who wants to go out for pizza Friday?"". Whoever wants to responds, and they make a private group chat to work out the details.



-I don't ""control"" the hangouts. Like any friend group, you've got people who plan and people who show up. There under 20 people who regularly to semi-regularly suggest outings. When we suggest an outing, anybody in the Discord can see that and choose to join.



-People are not invited to join the Discord right away. That happens organically, if they've come to some of the stuff one of us has planned and WANT to join. We all have plenty of friends who aren't a part of the Discord but are invited out to things that interest them. Of the 3 shitty sets of couples invited, only 1 couple was ever on the Discord.



-At the dinner this weekend, one of Annie & Ash's friends got into a fight with another person and he and his girlfriend/wife walked out, stiffing us on their meals & drinks. Instead of confronting Annie & Ash privately, the friend who got into a fight with the new people lashed out at Annie & Ash on the Discord and said he didn't want them inviting anybody else to anything. A lot of other people chimed in, some very nicely, some nastily (kinda like AITA comments, lol). Lots of harsh words were said on many sides.



-So now everyone, but especially those of us who plan stuff, are wondering how to handle Ash & Annie wanting to invite people to future stuff. Some of us have talked about it. So do we, as a group, say it's clear that nobody wants them to invite people to stuff? Do we all do it one at a time and they possibly hear from over a dozen people that people think their friend choices are shit? Are we assholes if we tell them (either individually or together) that they can't invite along other friends anymore?

"I had an accidental pregnancy. Unbeknownst to me, my husband told his parents I was pregnant literally hours after we found out, even though we were already very seriously talking about aborting (for very personal reasons I won't go into). After I had an abortion he kept bringing up the ""baby"" to me, talking about what size it would be and what body parts it would be developing if I was still pregnant. I asked him to go to therapy, he refused. I also recently discovered he let his parents believe I was still pregnant and they were about to be grandparents, and I had no idea because I don't really talk to my in-laws. After I found out I just left, because I was so freaked out. He's angry with me for leaving, and I have told him I won't come home until he comes clean to his parents and agrees to seeing a therapist. He thinks I'm being unreasonable. He says he got ""caught up in"" the lie because he felt weird telling his conservative parents I had an abortion and that he supported it (he could have just said I miscarried, or, you know, not told them that early in a pregnancy that was already unlikely to continue) and he thought they'd pressure him to leave me for aborting his baby. He admits he messed up by lying but doesn't think he has a problem he needs to address. I don't feel comfortable in the house with him until he's started to work through whatever's going on with him and it's seriously creeping me out, but he thinks I'm overreacting. AITA?",0
"I have twin boys who are nine. One of them received an invite to a birthday from a class mate. Since my boys are twins, I texted the parent and asked if my other son is invited also. They responded yes absolutely.

I followed up and asked what the birthday boy liked for a present. The parent responded and said no presents are needed.

I unfortunately could not take them to the party so my wife took them. Apparently everyone brought a present and my kids were the only one who didn't.

My wife and kids are still giving me a hard time because they felt awkward. My wife said social nicety should have dictacted that we bring a gift.

I maintain that since we were given explicit instructions that no gifts are needed I don't feel bad about it at all.

Am I or my family the asshole?",0
"My 10 year old son had to watch some snoopy cartoon in class during which woodstock eats a roast turkey. The teacher told the class that this is fictional, and that birds don't eat other birds. My son corrected her and said something along the lines of ""my uncle trains falcons to hunt other birds at the airport to protect the airplanes""

The teacher got upset said he was ""disrespectful"" and ""talking back"" and sent him to the principal's office. I got called and they explained hte situation, that he corrected the teacher. I said ""well was he right?"" and the principal said ""it doesn't matter, this was rude and you need to teach your son show some respect to authority"" and I told the principal ""I'm not going to punish my son or make him apologize if he was right, maybe your teacher should be better educated""

The principal looked a bit shocked and just told me to leave. Fine by me. Really reconsidering this school.",0
"I know that the title makes me seem like the bad guy and maybe I am but please here me out. 
My (19f) sister (23f) got pregnant when she was 18 and about to leave for college. Her boyfriend at the time skipped town and she was left to raise the baby by herself. My sister has always been my parents favorite, she could never do anything wrong. But that Immediately changed after she got pregnant. She had to make the decision to not go to college and instead raise her baby. Of course my parents put in financial support and helped her with whatever she needed,and her son have been well off since. 

Ever since my parents looked at me as their golden child I stay putting in much more effort in school and was taking almost all AP classes my Junior and senior year. I eventually got into my top school for pre med, so I was obviously worried about how much money it would cost. But my parents told me not to worry and that they had saved enough money to send me to my dream school. I was super happy to be going and was eager to start college. One day my sister was with ne when I was buying supplies for school, My sister asked me what community college I was attending, I then told her that I was going to my dream school and she flipped out.

She was yelling at me, because apparently my parents had told her that I would be attending community college instead to save money for her and her son. When we got home she Immediately confronts my parents, she asked them where did all that money come from and why they lied to her. That is when my mom tells my sister that they had used HER college money they had saved for her before she got pregnant to pay for my college.  My parents apparently had no hope that my sister would ever consider going back to college after she decided not to go, so they just saved the money for me. My sister stormed out of room, and I blew up at my parents tell them that they should have told me and I would have  chosen a school nearby. 

I tried to talk to my sister but she would not talk to me for days. When she finally decided to talk to me, she demanded that I go to community college and give her all the money for her and her son. I told her that I understood how angry she was at my parents but I would not be sacrificing my future just so she could have the money for her son. She got very mad at me and called me a thief and selfish for not giving her back her money.

Although I feel bad for taking the money from my sister, I worked very hard to get into this school and her and her son are taken care of by my family. I think that it is selfish of me  to keep the money but it isn’t my fault my sister got pregnant and chose not to go to college.
So AITA?",0
"shes 23f im 18F. Grandma died 8 years ago, and she left more than enough money to pay for all her grandkid's colleges educations with a few stipulations: dont get arrested, do drugs, be a drunk, get pregnant / get someone else pregnant. The money was put into accounts in the parents names since we were all kids then.

In sophomore year my sister got pregnant. Shit hit the fan panicking about college, the baby daddy left & she hasnt tried to find him/get child support, & the stress from that caused a hard complicated pregnancy. both are ok.

Mom * dad still let her go to college as long as she didnt have another and maintained a 3.5 gpa. which she did. She graduated last December with about 2 grand in debt, I figured her money must have been used to help raise her kid and pay for her pregnancy the past 2.5 years so she had to get a bit of a loan. which seemed understandable.

Boy I was wrong! I got accepted to my dream college on the other side of the state, but mom kept trying to get me to go to a cheaper one near home so I dont need a dorm and it would be a cheaper school. I asked her why she was so insistent, grandma left plenty of money i thought. Turns out, they flushed all the money that was supposed to go to me down the toilet to take care of my sister & her kid & her expensive pregnancy, turns out was a lot worse than I was led to believe.

I broke down and just lost it crying harder than I ever have. Shouting how they fucked me over and ruined my life for the kid that fucked up. now I'll have at least 70k debt if I go to school. I guess this upset my sister and she asked in a very upset tone if id rather her be out on the streets destitute and unable to care for her kid(who she 'reminded' me was a living being) because she didnt have an education/support system just so I could go on to college and have a good life.

I said yes, how its not fair that she got to fuck up, get drunk and sleep with so many guys she doesnt know who the baby daddy is(something she told me but apparently not mom or dad), kept breaking rule after rule while I havent ever even had sex with my bf. And now Im the one that has to be punished for it.

everything just keep devolving in to more yelling/fighting until I left. Ive been staying with my bf for the past few days. I know with the rona i shouldnt gp anywhere but i just wanted to be with the one person i feel like actually gives a damn about me.

moms been texting/calling trying to get me to come home, saying if i can just be reasonable and not vilify my sister we can probably work something out. I told her unless she has money grandma left for me dont talk to me until I have my college loans paid off in 50 years.

Did I go too far? A lot of it was driven by emotion but i really feel fucked over here and like im being punished despite being the one that followed the rules.

I've since slept with my bf, i figure if Im getting punished same as if i would have broken all the rules i can at least have fun.

3000 char limit is an AH


EDIT: been texting sis some this morning to try and mend stuff with her since i didnt think mom and dad spending the money was her fault. she was told about it after she graduated and was asked to keep me in the dark. She has offered to pay for 'a book or two' but not more since she wants to move out to 'get out from under mom and dad's thumb'. probably to party again since she doesnt hide how much she misses it.

edit 2: there was a bit left after sis got done at college and was told about it all. They decide to use it to get her a car so she'd be able to get to work. and she went along with it.... now im pissed at all 3 again.


EDIT 3: emailed my copy of the will to the  laywer. he says due to how it was set up he cant be certain right now we have a case but theres a good shot.


EDIT 4: lawyer says they may have violated the trust grandma set up so hes contacting a trust lawyer friend of his to help make sure hes reading it all right

edit 5:(holy shit so many edits sorry!) auntie got back to me. Shes mad at my parents. when she called to see what was going on all they did was (her words) try to justify it. Turns out dad and mom offered to pay for an abortion and sis didnt want one(understandable i wouldnt ether but still dont always get what we want). and sis thought going on government assistance was trashy and refused. so mom and dad felt like this was the only way to keep her 'safe'. She says they still arent sorry and mom said shed do it again if she had to do it all over. and of course as you might imagine they're mad at me for telling people. But since its just making others mad at the mim just laughing at this point.",0
"Long story, short: I asked my boyfriend to accompany me to the funeral of a dear friend and he acted rudely about it.

I (F19) asked my boyfriend (M21) to accompany me to the funeral of my friend, who’s been like a mother to me since I was 5 yrs old. She passed away due to Covid; it was very unexpected and heart breaking. I asked him to come with me because I have really bad anxiety and I need the support. He reluctantly agreed and I thanked him because he has never met my friend or my friends family, so I knew it would be a little uncomfortable for him. As I’m thanking him, he interrupts me saying “all I’m saying is, if it’s (the funeral) longer than 2 f*****g hours then I’m leaving. I don’t give a f**k what anyone says”. I was completely shocked. When he saw the look on my face, he proceeded with “that’s my only god d**n day off, and I’m not wasting it at a f*****g funeral.” He went to say more, I guess to justify what he had said, and I interrupted him; I just told him that he didn’t have to go and I wouldn’t let him say anything more. I am very offended and upset because this lady was like my mother. Could he not have respectfully declined? And he hasn’t apologized; am I the asshole to ask him to attend the funeral of someone that he doesn’t know? If the roles were reversed, I would not have hesitated to agree, just because I know how much just being there for someone can help with overwhelming emotions.


Edit: He apologized and asked me what time the funeral is, but I told him that I don’t want him to go. I am so flipping upset right now, I don’t want him to be there anymore.


UPDATE: I’m not going to leave him yet. I know that might sound bad, but I want to talk to my therapist first so that she can help me come up with a safe exit plan; it may come to a break, but it will probably be a break-up. He said he feels terrible, but I don’t know if he’s being genuine and I don’t really care. Thank you all so much for the feedback. I read almost every comment, but I don’t have a lot of time to answer all of them back. Just know that I appreciate each one of you! The funeral is today. I still am not letting him attend, because if he has a bad attitude then I’ll lose my shit. Thank you so much, again! I’m taking every comment into consideration❤️",0
"I (36f) am a medical doctor. I've been friends with ""Ben"" (37m) for 4 years. 

Today we were having a conversation about my boss who is a doctor. I referred to him as ""Dr. Samuels"". Ben wanted to know why I didn't call my boss Mr. Samuels and I replied along the lines of wanting to respect his title. 

Ben then responded by asking me if I wasn't a ""Ms."" I said technically I am but my title is Dr. He kept insisting that I respond to his yes or no question ( he tends to get annoyed if he isn't given a direct yes or no to his yes or no questions) 
At this point I got angry and basically blew up at him saying no I'm not a Ms. My title is Dr. and I should be  referred to as that. 

He then wanted to know why I was getting angry. It made me wonder if I was in the wrong for getting upset. 

As an aside I do not expect my friends or family to call me Dr. In fact I can get embarrassed by it outside of work.",0
"I (19M) made a blanket for my coworker (24F) as a present for her baby boy that was due the next month. It was 100% cotton, handmade, and free, as it was just me being nice. Once he was born, she was overjoyed. But when she used the blanket to swaddle her son, he ended up getting a rash from the material. She blamed me, and accused me of being inconsiderate and not taking caution of her child's allergy. I argued that he was a newborn and it was a gift, informing her that nobody can know the allergies of their child before they are born. She got upset and demanded I made her a new blanket that her child wasn't allergic to. I refused because 1) she didn't pay me for anything the first time 2) she refused to pay me for anything this time and 3) I don't have the time anymore, as I have other orders to make for actual paying customers. I told her that I would reconsider if she offered to pay the labor fee, and I could waive her material cost as a discount, but this wasn't good enough for her. So, I gotta ask, aita for not making her another blanket?

Edit: for those of you asking if it could be the detergent, I didn't wash it before giving it to her. And those mentioning knitting, its one of those knot blankets where its two fabrics tried on top of each other to make it thicker. I thought I should mention that.",0
"When I was 13, I was using my dad's phone and I was dumb and very clearly wrong when I opened a text that popped up from my stepmom. She was a few months pregnant at the time.

A few texts up I saw that my dad had sent a text saying:

""Alice (my mom) is being a bitch again. I'm so glad I get to have a baby with someone I actually love.""

To which my stepmom replied:

""And I can't wait to have a kid without her awful genes mixed in.""

Which my dad found very funny based on his response.

The reason I remember these texts so clearly is because I sent a copy of them to my mom. 

I knew my dad and mom hated each other. But I felt extremely insulted and betrayed by the texts because they directly involved me.

I refused to stay at my dad's house ever since and when my dad took my mom to court, I told the judge that I can't live with him anymore. 

My dad and stepmom spent a very long time apologizing. He does seem genuinely sorry because he has cried in front of me.

But I can't really bring myself to forgive him. 

I also know I shouldn't have snooped. But I can't unsee those texts.

"When I (30M) was 5, my family took me to one of those Japanese steakhouses where they cook the food at your table.  When the cook lit the grill and the huge flame shot up into the air, it scared the heck out of me and I ran and hid in the corner and was too afraid to come back to the table.  My aunt, (64F) has teased me about that ever since.  That was twenty-five years ago and I swear she brings it up every single time I see her!  I've told her repeatedly to stop talking about it.  My parents have also asked her to stop bringing it up to no avail.  It's gotten so tiresome and embarrassing and she teases me about it in front of the whole family despite me repeatedly telling her to stop.  

&#x200B;

I've never really gotten along well with my aunt and lately I've made it a point to avoid her at family gatherings.  We celebrated my birthday Friday and I wanted to go to one of those Japanese steakhouses.  I didn't invite my aunt but my grandmother invited her behind my back.  I didn't know she was coming until she showed up.  I was already pissed off that my grandmother invited her (she told me that my aunt is family and I cant just exclude her from everything) but as soon as we sat down, my aunt started ribbing me about that incident when I was five.  I told her to stop bringing it up and my mom told her to stop as well, but when the cook was fixing to light the hibachi, she asked me in this really condescending way ""You sure you don't wanna go hide in the corner for old time's sake?""   


I finally just lost my temper and went off on her right there in front of the whole restaurant.  I basically yelled at her ""Will you just shut up about that already?  That was 25 years ago!  Is that literally all you have to talk about?  I'm sick of hearing about it!  This is why I didn't invite you!""  


I swear the entire restaurant must have been staring at me and I felt like just walking out.  The entire rest of the dinner was awkward and I couldn't even enjoy my meal.  After we left my grandmother told me that I embarrassed her in front of everyone and that my outburst was completely uncalled for and that I owed my aunt an apology.

My parents told me I didn't owe my aunt anything and were angry at my grandmother for inviting her, but I still feel like an asshole for losing my temper and yelling in front of the restaurant, and the whole thing was deeply embarrassing.  My grandmother and my aunt are also both blasting me on Facebook for embarrassing them in public.  So AITA?",0
"Hear me out... this happened yesterday. My (44F) cousin (32F) called me in a panic because she wants to call the police on her neighbor for abusing her children because ""she left them outside in the heat and won't let them back indoors"". Cousin states she saw the children playing and the younger boy (approx 10-11) was ""too sweaty and red faced"". She walked over and offered the kids a popsicle which they accepted, and then asked why they didn't go inside until the hottest part of the day was over (upper 90s with full sun). Kids told her that the mother was cleaning the house and told them to stay out until she was finished and locked the doors so they wouldn't bother her. Cousin, thinking this is just not okay, knocks on the neighbor's door to ask if this is, indeed, true. Neighbor explains that the boys  have been told to stay outside until she finishes her cleaning, as they'd been arguing amongst themselves all morning and she (neighbor) needed ""a few hours of quiet before lunch'. Neighbor also said she locked the door because they were constantly coming in and out, slamming the door each time. Neighbor told cousin that both boys were fed a hearty breakfast, and sent outside with snacks, and there is a fridge in the garage that holds cold drinks. Cousin said neighbor was ""pretty rude"" and then asked her to leave, which upset cousin even more. I asked cousin if the kids looked sick or had asked her for help. NO. Are they playing in the street? NO. Are they disrupting your work by being outside? NO. She feels the mother should be reported for locking her children out of their own house in the summer heat, and that neighbor was unjustly rude. I told my cousin she needed to mind her own business and that being made to play outdoors instead of sitting in front of a monitor or tv all day, was not abuse and I'd probably be rude to her, too.

"I work in a corporate setting which requires me to always be in formal apparel. I have gotten use to wearing formal clothing to the point that I pretty much prefer to wear it most of the time. Whether I'm picking my kids up from practice, visiting family or go shopping except for when I go to the gym, I wear tailored pants with a button up of some sorts. I know that I'm overdressed most of the time  but I just enjoy being dressed well and it has become my style. My wife on the other hand is completely opposite of me. She likes wearing casual and comfortable clothes like sweatpants and hoodies which is completely fine. But my wife says that when we go out together that I make her look like a slob because I'm overdressed making her look like she doesn't take care of herself.

We visited my in laws a couple of days ago. I was wearing my usual style of clothing while my wife was just wearing a hoody and some sweatpants. My wife's mother made a joke about me looking nice in my clothes and than jokingly said that people would never assume that my wife and I are married and that I should encourage her to not dress like a slob. I just laughed it off and told her that my wife just likes being comfortable.

This didn't go over well with my wife and told me when we got back home that I should stop dressing like a pretentious person and wear 'normal clothing' like everybody else and stop making her look bad. I told that nobody cares what she wears and that I don't tell her how to dress so she can't tell me how to dress. This turned into a petty argument that shouldn't have even taken place at all.

"My mom died when I was 6 years old. My dad ended up turning to one of his good friends, Ana, and they ended up getting married when I was 7. Ana brought up the idea of adopting me the day of the wedding. It was something my dad was all for but I went nuts when she mentioned it to me and I kinda spoiled the rest of the wedding. For the next year we did this really intense therapy where I was told over and over again, by the therapist and them, that I needed a mom, that it would provide safety for me, and that it was not a betrayal of my mom to accept another loving mom into my life. The therapist put the recommendation into the court to approve it, but when the judge spoke to me, I told him that I would run away, and that I would do everything to never come back. I was 8 at the time and meant business. He asked me why I didn't want to be adopted. He listened. And when he addressed the court again he denied the adoption request and told my dad and Ana that until I was on board no adoption would be approved in his court.

They did try again, requesting a different judge, but received the same response.

I was asked constantly to change my mind. Ana would put her all into trying to fill the place of a mom in my life. Every time I told her she could never be my mom she took it as a challenge to try harder, and better, and she would dedicate so much time to me it was crazy. I never appreciated it because instead of just being Ana, and instead of my dad telling her to just be Ana, she saw mom as the only thing she wanted. Even when she had kids of her own, I was their oldest son, I was her son, her boy, she'd call herself a boy mom, etc.

Whereas I have never called her mom. If we're being honest I don't even love her after all these years. I see her as more of an intrusive family member who won't stop. My relationship with my dad is also not the best because I don't like that he wouldn't take no for an answer, and that he was so quick to try and push an adoption. Even after I told him I would rather be with grandparents, or an aunt/uncle or close family friend to Ana if he died, he insisted being with Ana and her being my mom was the best for me.

I turned 18 a few months ago and I ran like my ass was on fire to get away from dad and Ana. I lived with my maternal grandparents for a little while before moving in with my maternal uncle who lived near a really good apprenticeship I wanted to join.

My paternal grandparents celebrated their wedding anniversary this past weekend and I was there. While there Ana approached me and handed me papers for an adult adoption. She told me she loved me and she wanted me to know it was not too late, that she would still adopt me and she wanted to make our relationship official as mother and son. I asked her how she could be so delusional when I have said no to being adopted for 11 years now. I told her I would not change my mind.

"My husband and I hosted my 29th birthday party yesterday and invited 6 of our friends (3 couples that we consider our core friend group)

I had come across the concept of molecular food pairings a few months ago and was really intrigued by the idea. Some of the recommended pairings require expensive ingredients like caviar that I can’t justify buying on an average day but my birthday seemed perfect. So that’s what the theme was - a molecular tasting party. I put together a total of 15 “courses” but they were very small, just a few bites each. There was also a moderate amount of other snacks laid out and cocktails.

My husband and I both had a really good time. We ranked the pairings, had drinks and played card games. I thought everyone else enjoyed themselves too. 

This afternoon, we got a text that was presumably sent to the wrong group chat that said, “can we just be honest and say that the whole thing was weird? She’s like this every year. The rest of us just go out, how has she not gotten the idea yet? It’s rude”

Another person replied, “at least last year she made an actual meal. I’m mad I even brought a gift”

I sent “wtf?” back and the whole chat has been silent since. 

I don’t know what to think. It really hurt my feelings and I don’t even feel like they like me at all if they talk about me like that but also… if I’m making people feel like they’re forced to participate in things they think are weird, that’s a selfish thing to do too and maybe they’re right.",0
"My bf (m27) and I (f27) have been living together for a little over a year now. We are generally great at sharing household chores - cooking, cleaning, errands, etc. I contribute more $$ to our living expenses because I earn more and have been working for a while and he is recently out of school and still paying off student debt. 

Last night, I was washing up after dinner and finished the dishes that we used. He was just standing there and pointed to his lunch containers and said “could you clean those up” to which I said “wait, your lunch containers?” He responded with a bite in his tone, “yes, I cooked and cleaned tonight, and do way more than you around the house, so yeah, you can clean those up.” 

I was really upset about his tone and the request. We can help each other out with housework, but shouldn’t someone be responsible for their own lunch containers they bring to work? He maintains that because I was washing up, I could’ve washed and put the containers away. He maintains that the tone was rude but the request is fair. Curious to hear if you think ITA here.",0
"So I have a friend, let's call her ""J"" and another friend ""M"". So far J and i have been in almost every class together since the first semester of college. Right now we are on our fourth and there was a mishap with the schedules and J and I aren't really together in any classes except one. M and i have been friends but she hasn't been in my classes until right now. We're together in almost every class and so we hang out a ton. M is also in the class that J and i have together. Right before the semester vegan M texted me and asked me if I'd sit next to her in class cuz she didn't have other people she knew and I agreed.

A couple days ago I went to class and sat with M. J came in but there was another friend of ours so she sat with him. Then there was a free hour after class and M and I were playing a multiplayer game and i wasn't really paying attention to what was going on around me. I realised later that the friend who say with J had left and J was alone and a couple minutes later she left as well. 

I realised she J probably felt very left out so I texted her after i went back home but i didn't really get a proper response and she did tell me she was sick so I assumed that she didn't really want to text anyone.

I learned today from two of my other friends that she's indeed been hurt that I'd ""ignored"" her. I tried texting her and even asked her when she'd be free to hang out so we can talk about it but she hasn't really responded properly. I feel really bad for having hurt her. Am I the asshole?",0
"For mother's day my friend asked me to draw her a card for her mom who I've met a couple times and is super nice. Being the artsy friend of the group, I didn't mind at all and spent a couple hours making the damn thing. Turns out there was a small art competition my school set up for mother's day where the best card could you earn a $200 gift card to Michaels.

Apparently she found out about the competition through her English teacher who ran the event and submitted the card I made for her mom under her name and ended up winning the prize. I didn't find out until the assembly we had today and felt lied to. She told me that she gave it to her mom who said it was so good, she had to submit it so it wasn't her fault. When I asked if we could at least split the prize, she said no and that it was hers now since I gave it to her and that she already spent the prize. After talking it over with my friends, we ended up reporting her to the principal's and said that she would be suspended from future school event. 

I now feel like shit since she came back to me and yelled at me saying I ruined her school year and none of our friends want to talk to her anymore but I just feel that it was unfair for her to submit something that wasn't her's without my permission. Aita?

Update: She said that she would be willing to repay me half of the prize since I did draw it for her but that she deserves the other half for submitting it. However she won't repay me unless I go to the principals office with her to undo her school suspension. Honestly at this point I don't really care about the money and feel that she's just trying to manipulate me since there's actual consequences now.",0
"My wife recently passed away. However, we have been legally separated for almost 2 years and filed for divorce. Among the reasons for divorce were that she had an affair and became an alcoholic. She refused to do anything to address it. I begged her relentlessly to please seek help, go to rehab, etc. and after years of refusing I couldn't watch her do this to herself. She died from liver failure. I sat with her in doctors' offices and heard them tell her if she didn't stop drinking, she would be dead by 40. It finally happened.

The divorce had not been finalized yet as we were required to be separated for at least a year and COVID happened and Court's closed. I also allowed her to remain on my medical insurance, as she had many issues over the years related to her alcoholism.

During the marriage, we purchased life insurance policies for both of us. Each are for several hundred thousand dollars. After our separation, she removed me as the beneficiary and named her parents instead.

Since she passed, her parents have taken the lead in planning her funeral. She will be buried in a plot that her parents purchased for them and her other family members in her hometown which is several hundred miles from where we lived while married. Unbeknownst to me, as her parents were planning everything they were telling all of the vendors that ""funeralcosts13 would be paying for everything."" I did not know this until I received an emailed invoice for several thousand dollars. This is only a fraction of what the total costs will end up being.

I immediately called her mother to discuss and told her I had not agreed to pay for her funeral and, in fact, these costs are exactly why I bought the life insurance policies years ago. They said they do not have much money at the moment (which is not true) and that they figured I would pay anyway because I do have a lot of money. I do have a very good job and could afford to pay for it without a significant impact on my quality of life. However, I do not feel I should be the one paying for the funeral, especially since they are going to significantly benefit financially from her death. Her mom was to call me back when both she and her father could be on the phone. I never got a call back. I received only a condescending text message trying to make me feel guilty. I have since let them know that I will pay for a very small portion of the funeral to make sure that it can proceed, but I will not be paying for anything else: the religious service (my ex was not religious, her parents are), the flowers, the luncheon for relatives afterward (which is at a restaurant she hated), etc. I also informed them I will no longer be attending the funeral next week. I visited my ex in the hospital before she passed and have made my peace with her and her death. I feel as if I'm just being taken advantage of. So, AITA for not paying for the funeral expenses and not attending the funeral??",0
"I (25M) was awoken by my sister (26F) this morning when she told me her ride for her 1:30 appointment had cancelled. I wasn’t told about this appointment beforehand. Honestly, she does this a lot. She makes appointments or has a sudden, urgent errand, doesn’t give any heads-up, and I’m expected to just drop whatever I’m doing and drive her around.

We don’t generally get along. She’s very mentally ill, prone to tantrums and fits of rage over trivial things. I recently moved back home in September after my rent went up 30% and I just couldn’t afford it. From September until early January I was her ride. She has a car, but something is apparently wrong with it and it can’t be driven. I’ve never gotten any specifics, just that a male acquaintance inspected it and declared the engine “could explode at any time”. I agreed to drive her to work on the condition she pay $15/week for gas & maintenance. She agreed. I think in all that time she paid me *maybe* five or six times. Our step-dad drove her sometimes, but it was mostly me.

We both live together in our parents’ finished basement. She has the only bedroom, and I live in an office area that has no door & no privacy. [In short, she’s a slob.](https://imgur.com/a/sXUHNgV) Things aren’t that bad right now but it’s indicative of her general habits. I did a lot of work to get this place clean but it’s slowly getting worse as she doesn’t pull her weight. She has three cats and a dog. The dog is a poorly trained, poorly socialized and very aggressive pitbull. She had two, but she had one euthanized last year after it bit her. The cats stay locked up in our large laundry/utility room. They’d scratch up the furniture and pee everywhere otherwise. She doesn’t clean their litter box. She just leaves it until it’s one big concretion of piss, shit and litter and then replaces it. The whole room *reeks* of cat piss, and my room is right outside so the smell leaks out. They’ve peed on all the towels and bedding that were stored in there. I have a cat myself so it hurts seeing them forced to live like that, but I don’t want our area ruined too.

I try to be patient with her. I remind her of her chores politely. But she’s just mean. She says the most vile, hateful things to me day in and day out over trivial bullshit. She’s incredibly demanding, with seemingly no regard for others. She takes/steals food, alcohol, cigarettes and whatever else she wants. Anything less than exactly what she wants is met with abject hatred. She’s been acting this way for over a decade. Despite all of this I’m expected, by her and our mother, to just ignore all the turmoil and essentially give her whatever she needs. Our mother insists that my sister and I are equally to blame for all this friction. I feel like I’m going crazy. I just keep to myself, only interacting with her when spoken to, when I remind her to clean up, or when something of mine has “gone missing”. Despite all of this, I still feel guilty over my refusal this morning.",0
"I (38F) am very close with my daughter (18F) I had her when I was 19.
We both have ADHD and we hadn't had our meds in 2 months due to the national shortage. 

A few days ago they finally came in and we were super excited. On the 2cd day when my meds were wearing off after a very busy day I was crashing hard. We were talking about STD's since she has a BF and wanted to make sure she was safe. I suggested that she should get a panel done whether she was asymptomatic or not because accidents happen but with my lovely ADHD 3D brain I was having trouble thinking of the correct words. 

The brain Fog was real.
 I accidentally said ""Mistakes happen, I mean you were a mistake.""

 I immediately realized that wasn't the right word and I was having a really hard time putting it to together.

 In my 3D super brain I just saw ""Red car, Blue Car, Train"" I told her crap thats not the word what's the other word?! Knowing that Mistake was not what I meant to say.

 I explained I can't get the word all I see is ""Red car, blue car, Train"". 
She and my husband burst out laughing and say ""Do you mean 'Accident?!'"" to which I was like crap duh.


The issue is my daughter understands because she is older and also has ADHD and she knows that since my stroke I have a hard time finding words. But my 14 year old son thought I was being mean. I tried to explain that in my brain I saw A red Car, A Blue Car and a Train I was associating Car ""accident"" and train ""accident"". My daughter was immediately saying that she was telling this story at the next family gathering and she would never let me live it down. 

My family is not very chill and I'm worried they will think it's something it wasn't or worse make her feel like it's true. So Am I the Asshole?",0
" 

There are three children, elementary aged, that live on my street, two a couple houses down from me, the other across the street from them. They are constantly running into the road to cross, or after something, or riding some toy down the middle (bike, three-wheeler, scooter). As such I creep down my road past their house to get to mine. Like, 10-15 mph with the clutch in and my foot hovering over the break. 

Well, about a week ago I am creeping along as the kids are riding bikes down the middle of the road. The youngest is in the middle of the road heading for me, but looking behind her to her brother. I realized that she isn’t going to stop so, with cars on either side so I couldn’t pull over, I come to a stop in the middle of the road. 

As I am putting my car in reverse, she turns around and sees me. She swerves around me, and lets out a “Whoa.” I wait for the others to clear the road, and move past and park in my driveway. I was getting out of my car when the girl rides up behind my car. “You almost hit me!”

I calmly told her that no, she almost hit me, and that she and her brother are the reason why I got a dashcam. (There are other benefits, but the kids were my primary motivation.) She didn’t understand, but then asked about my daughter (high school age) and if she was still in school because she’s so old. 

I answered, and went inside thinking nothing more of it. About an hour later there is a hammering on my door. My husband answered to see the girl’s mom. She sees me and starts screaming about how horrible I am that I told her daughter that I got a dashcam because of her and her brother. 

My husband closed the door in her face and locked it. 

I recounted this to a coworker, and they said I’m an asshole for telling the kid the truth even if it didn't bother the kid. I don’t think so because the kids need to learn to have more awareness around the road. So I will accept my judgment.",0
"Background:

My (38F) best friend “Clay” (37M) and I get together about 2 to 3 times a year to attend the ballet, plays and musicals. I usually purchase the tickets and Clay takes care of the additional. Sometimes Clay’s husband “Ray” (35M) will join us but that is rare due to his busy schedule 

The Situation:

Clay purchased tickets for us to see Phantom of the Opera. Ray was excited to see the show and told his Aunt “Joey” and Uncle-in-law “Marc”. Joey asked if she, Marc and their son, Henry could also come. Ray said yes and Clay informed me. I was fine with it but a little nervous.

The problem comes that Joey had expected Clay to cancel my ticket so that it would be a family night. When she discovered that I was still attending, she made a point to behave in a bullying manner in hopes I’d leave and she’d get her way. It was quite upsetting how cruel she was to me. 

Joey made a point to mention that she wanted to attend the next play/musical that Clay and Ray and I were supposed to see. 

Would I be the AH if I told Clay, I won’t be attending any shows with that woman? I don’t want any hardships with Ray or Clay but I think I’m justified in this.",0
"So some context, me and my nine year old sister were playing through Deltarune chapter 2 together. She really likes it and undertale due to the characters and charming humor. I figured it would be good for her to read out the dialogue so that she can improve her fluency in speaking and reading since the school books are generally pretty boring. (Ignore this next part for the context in game and or spoilers.) It was the scene where we solve the final puzzle in a series of rooms while a generally high on heels snobby character downplays the main character and claims to solve it while doing so. After this, a hotheaded character pokes a lot of fun at the snobby one for acting so high and mighty and more smart then the rest, then reclaiming “you are just as much of a dumbass as the rest of us.”

Dumbass is the most severe swear said and it was only used like twice in the game. My other middle sister heard this in the other room and began yelling at me for making her say it, saying it was terrible of me to show her such an inappropriate game to her. I tried to explain that she was just reading off the screen and she understands that the shouldn’t say it and pointing out the fact that our parents say much more worse and vulgar stuff then the game around her, especially in the car. It became a back and forth of the same argument where ironically she calls me an asshole and a retard while she was in the next room. My little sister doesn’t swear at all despite this environment. I know I should’ve taken a little initiative and stopped her from reading it out loud but I feel this is getting blown way out of proportion.",0
"Some details have been changed for privacy.

Hi all, long time lurker, first time poster here. 

Some background first. I (37F) have been married to my husband H (36M) for nearly two years now. We live in Canada, he's Canadian and I moved here 3 years ago. Prior to that I was born and brought up in India. Neither of us is very religious or traditional, and I'm openly deist. Both our families are somewhat religious but not very devout. They had a few reservations about us but so far it's all been great. For our wedding, we had small wedding ceremonies in both cultures and a party afterwards. And my husband's family quite enjoyed participating in all the pre wedding functions for the Indian part.

On to the problem. As part of the Indian wedding, my husband had to place  a mangalsutra around my neck. A mangalsutra is a gold necklace with black beads and in our culture it's equivalent to a wedding ring but only for the women. I don't like them, because they're sexist, and because they're chunky, ugly and don't go with anything. I told my mother not to get me this, and not to include it in the ceremony because it's an expensive waste. I won't wear it, and it's like a white elephant, I can't give it away or sell it. I have to keep it. My mother being the smart cookie that she is, worked with my cousin to have one with a modern design, custom made for me. It's stylish, minimalist and goes with almost, everything and I love it. I still don't wear it all the time, but quite frequently. As a contrast I wear my wedding ring all the time. Because my husband wears one too and because I like wearing rings. 

The problem I'm having is with H's sister E. E and I get along quite well, and I'm quite keen on fostering a good relationship with my in-laws because all my family is back in India. E loved the design of my mangalsutra and wants to borrow it. Now, I'm not religious at all, but no one can shed the influence of their culture completely and it's the same for me. For me the mangalsutra is a symbol of my matrimony and not something that can just be lent out, especially not to my husband's sister. I've offered to have something similar made for her, but she says she doesn't want us to go through the trouble or the expense for something she only wants to wear once or twice.

Why I think ITA is that I can see her point. I am a logical person, and logically I have no reason to refuse. And I can't just pick and choose the things I want to be logical about. But emotionally, for me, the necklace is like underwear. You may or may not wear it, but you don't share it. FTR I'd have the same feelings about it, if it were of the traditional design and I didn't like it as much as I do.

I've tried to explain this to her. It's not something we've fought about, and she always accepts a refusal graciously, but she doesn't stop asking. It's like she thinks after a reasonable time passes it'll be okay for her to borrow it.

So reddit AITA?",0
"My husband, baby (6months) and I were headed out in the car to goto the Grocery store. I am a new mom and get very  nervous when people aren't safe around my baby. We live in an area where you park in a back alley and the road to leave is a 1 way around a corner. Just as we are turning the corner down the 1 way street a taxi comes driving down the wrong way towards us. We had to stop and back up as he continued trying to get past us. I rolled my window down and said ""Hey, this is a 1 way, you can't come down this way"" and he replied ""Oh do you work for the cops?"" and he looked stoned out of his mind. I replied ""well we have a baby in the car and you could've hit us"" and he said ""well I didn't"" and drove off. I called the taxi company and reported the driver for driving down the wrong side of the road and potentially being stoned, I don't think someone she be actively driving like that. After I hung up the call my husband informed me that I shouldn't have done that because he has seen that taxi parked a few houses down several times and thinks that he is our neighbor and will now come and slash our tires or do something to the car. Am I the asshole for reporting this guy who might be my neighbor? ",0
"So about 2-3 days ago I (16f) sat with a group of popular girls that not a lot of people in my friend group like. I decided to sit with them bc some of them are really nice and I actually enjoy their company but my friend group got mad at me especially 5 girls, let’s call them Eva, Nora, Nate, Liliana and Julieta (made up names). Wile I was sitting with the popular girls Nate and Eva started to pass the table a lot and i didn’t say anything but I was kinda nervous bc they’re kinda mean to me. Eventually Eva, Nora, Nate, Liliana and Julieta came up to me and told me that they wanted to talk to me so I followed them to the bathroom and they asked me why I didn’t want to sit with them and i told them that I did just that I wanted to hang out with my other friends and they smiled at me in a weird way. Eventually they came up to me again after like 5-6 minutes later and told me that another friend wanted to give me a doughnut so I went to were she was and she told me she didn’t have doughnuts and when I came back they said that she ate them all. Weird I thought but oh well. The next day I find out they were actually lying and wanted me to sit with them because I was “aBaNdOnInG tHeM” I didn’t sit with them because they are way to much drama and I honestly didn’t want to deal with that at the moment. I go up to Nora the next day and I ask her why she lied to me and she first denied it all but eventually she told me that it was a lie but that it was the friend that allegedly brought donuts idea. Weird because that same girl has never ever told me a lie but oh well I guess. Later that day I used that girls phone to take a picture and guess what I see? A group of all of them without me talking trash about me behind my back…. And the text messages said “omg I can’t believe that she bought it. she’s so dumb” by none other than Eva, the following text said “she asked me in the morning but she didn’t find out it was a lie” by Nora. My best freaking friend. Yesterday I sat with the same popular girls and didn’t speak to anyone in my “friend” group and they got mad at me. I told them I was mad because they lied to me and they started to say that o was a crybaby and stuff like that Lilian said that I was an a-hole and a d**k. I slept over the thought of that if I was actually being an a-hole and a d**k so I decided to ask you guys.

"I have a cousin by marriage (husband's cousin) that's 22 and dying of cancer. It was always her dream to marry and be a mom and now that's not going to happen. It's hard on everyone. She has a much older fiance (30) and they had a symbolic wedding so she could have the experience.

They started looking for ways to get access to a baby that she could take care of and experience some level of child care that way, but with 2020 and ethics in general, there's not a lot of ways to do that safely. My husband and I have the first and so far only children of our generation, who are 10 months and 23 months old.

I had hopes that it wouldn't happen, but her parents asked me if she/they could borrow my younger baby for ""a few weeks"". The cousin and her fiance would basically be playacting having a baby. Her parents would also join in on pretending. There would be photoshoots and everything. This makes me really uncomfortable.

It's really creepy. I cannot understate how creepy I think this is. I know that her not getting to live her dreams is sad, but I don't think this is the answer.

I'm worried it will be traumatic for my baby. She's almost a year old and will, well, notice that her entire family will just vanish overnight for what will seem like forever. She's also still nursing, and they don't really seem to care about this factor.

I'm really worried about problems down the road. This is setting a dangerous precedent of my child living under other guardianship. Her parents will have time to get attached and they could try to use that for familial pressure if not legally. Her fiance is also a wild card in that regard.

I said no, and my husband's entire family is hounding us about this because her time is running out and it's time sensitive. They say we're being selfish. They say that we could use this as a free vacation and bond with our older child because I ""popped them out so close together"". They want to compromise now by letting me come by a few times a day to bring milk. We still don't want to do this. AITA

EDIT/UPDATE:

Yesterday afternoon, we got an email from the cousin's parents offering actual dollar amounts for us to agree. We got enough from that to file a police report and at least get the threat in writing. We also had a call with my husband's parents and his siblings to basically clear the air. Apparently what they were telling people they asked for and what they were actually asking for were very different. Everyone on that call now had them blocked on social media except for MIL (because of the cousin).",0
"Backstory I’m (31f) have gone back to studying nursing after working in aged care for a number of year. My partner (38m) owns his own business and we have different views on how to parent one of our children. My children c (6m) and m(5f) are they light of my life and the reason I went back to school to end up in a better position. My partner also has 3 children with his ex wife 17,15,13 however he seems to have very little patience with our son.
C is an loving little man that struggles to regulate his emotions, is behind where he should be in fine motor skills and in at his general school learning. He can be a handful on a bad day but adores anything farm related and practical stuff he’s great. However on a bad day all he wants is his mum and will lash out. Now our daughter is doted on by her father and will niggle her brother until he snaps. She’s not being nasty she’s also loving but she’s ahead of the curve in al aspects and struggles to understand why her brother isn’t.
But if she niggles he might snap and throw her icecream in the dirt or similar and my partners reaction is not to seperate them calm both down and get to the bottom of it but to snatch my sons and throw his in the dirt too.

AITA if I take my little boy to my parents to avoid confrontation when i have to go do practical classes for a week

Edit we are in testing stages to try and work out what is happening with my little boy

"I 100000% do not hate kids and this isn’t some mean witchy thing, I promise. But they love us so much that they end up giving us like 20+ handmade gifts every single month. Pictures, collages, hand painted ceramics, everything under the sun. These kids are crafty. 

Okay so it’s me, 25F, my husband, 34M, and SIL 32F and there are 7 kids, 2 to 11. It’s a BIG family.

We have a few things we love and cherish from them, but we can’t keep taking everything. Even when we’d try to put the pictures into a photo album, we ran out of room and have like three photo albums full of me as a gigantic circle and my husband as a frog or something.

Last weekend SIL handed us a new set of 4 mugs all painted by the kids. I gently asked her if she could maybe keep the mugs and dial back the handmade gifts from the kids, because we already have a ton of mugs and it’s just the two of us. 

She was SO offended and upset that she just got red in the face and started packing the mugs very upset and said she wouldn’t bother us again. 

I told her that’s not what I mean, but that we have so many things from the kids. I even suggested that maybe they get the kids an iPad so they can draw art to their heart's content. 

She grabbed the box and was making this really melodramatic exit and said like “I’ll let the kids know that their auntie doesn’t want their mugs they made with LOVE and wants her nice little Target mugs instead.”

She told MIL, who quietly told me that I should have just accepted the mugs and then thrown them away or something. I told her that I thought it would be better to ask for the kids to put all that energy elsewhere, to where it would be better appreciated.

"Me(28M) and my husband (30M) both have raised by single moms and we have met while we were in high school via our moms (they were at the same mom group of volunteers in our school). We have fallen in love at our school and we have been together since I am 15 so we are definitely a high school romance.

We were planning to get married at Summer 2020 but thanks to the world, we managed to get married at 2021 Summer and both of our moms have survived from cancer in last 2 years so we also decided to have this celebration about them. They were always wondering about gay bars and strip clubs but we being little dicks while we were at university and them having rough times, we never had the opportunity to bring them to a gay bar so we decided to honor their request and have the post-wedding party at one of the wildest gay bars in London. They really liked the idea and we invited everyone who was invited to our wedding. This caused a tremendous amount of shit and we got calls from every family member saying we were triggering our alcoholic relatives. Both of our families have generations of alcoholics and they don't drink. We said ""Not our problem."" and moved with the original plan. This resulted no one from our extended families coming to the ceremony and to the party . Luckily all of our friends and our moms made the enough crowd and our mothers had one of a night and I don't change it to one bit but I can not stop but feel guilty.

I had a small complication during surgery so I had to stay until Wednesday (yesterday). My partner returned work on Monday but he came back to pick me up.

The timing was a bad because there was an important football game yesterday and it was really important for my partner to watch it. I am not English so I don't quite 'get' the importance but it's a big deal for him and so important, I wanted to make sure he'd see the game. I suggested booking a room near the hospital so we wouldn't miss it due to the drive but he wanted to see the game at a friend's place. He said he'd make it.

While we were waiting to get me discharged he was getting agitated because it was taking a long time. He had to wait outside so he was in his car the whole time because of restrictions at the hospital. After a couple of hours he sent me a text that he had to leave or he'd miss the game. I begged him to not leave and reminded I could book a hotel. But he left without me, and luckily made it on time to see the start of the game. He said he'd come pick me up tomorrow (today) instead. 

The hospital wouldn't let me stay another night or leave alone. Luckily, one of my friends came to get me in the end. She didn't get to the hospital until late and we got back to London around 2am. The whole time I was trying to call and text my partner but he only said we could talk about it today. 

The whole evening I was texting and calling my partner, ever since the moment he left me at the hospital. He only sent me one whatsapp back that said he'd pick me up later but wanted to see the game. When I got home in the night he was so angry at me. He said I was the most selfish asshole for constantly ringing and texting him during the game and that I ruined the game for him and embarrassed him infront of his friends. He said he cannot even look at me and that I bring so much drama with me it's humiliating to him. I feel at complete loss. I think I might be the asshole for not understanding the cultural significance of football and asking my bf to do a completely unreasonable drive to pick me up. But on the other hand we could have watched the game in a hotel room and I wouldn't have been left alone in a hospital in another country. AITA?",0
"I (24 f) threw a first birthday party for my son Noah on Sunday, we live quite far from all of our family (about a 2 hour drive) so invited both mine and my partners family for a bbq. On the day my cousin (36 f)Stacey showed up an hour late ( she hadn’t actually gotten back to me on weather she was coming or not) and she brought her boyfriend that none of the family had met yet, that’s fine good thing I brought extra food. When my son saw her he came running over to say hi and she just blanked him sat in one of the chairs and stared at her phone while her boyfriend stared at her.

A little while after Stacey arrived my son had sneakily opened one of his presents and came running over squeeling in excitement to show me what he had, when he was near Stacey she stopped him took the toy told him to “go and sit down quietly” for a minuet because she has an announcement, my son came to where I was helping my niece put back on her shoes and he was visibly upset, he started pulling me to where his toy was and when I looked up Stacey’s boyfriend was on one knee holding out a ring and she was gushing about how he had already proposed but wanted everyone there when she said yes!

I. Was. Livid! I grabbed my sons toy and picked him up when Stacey said “your in the way of the video” her sister stood behind me videoing the ‘special moment’ on her phone, I took my son over to his trampoline and this is when my nan came to tell me how Stacey had taken my sons toy from him and then I heard her telling my partners family to move so they can get some pictures in front of my rose bush, that was it I told Stacey her boyfriend my aunt and other cousin to leave.

After leaving me multiple voicemails calling me out for ruining staceys engagement my aunt has now started calling me out on Facebook for kicking them out of a ‘family gathering’ but she ‘forgot’ to mention it was my sons birthday party and the reason why I asked them to leave so I put it on there for her.

Her friends started liking and commenting on my comment and next thing I knew I was blocked and stacey was texting me to ‘remind me the world doesn’t revolve around my son’ a ‘simple congratulations would have been nice’. And saying that I’ve turned the family against them.

"I work as a supervisor (I'm not going to say in what feild to protect my anonymity). One of my staff members is a single mother of four children. Her youngest is three and goes to daycare while mom is working. She has a 15 year old who does full remote learning and she has a nine year old and a ten year old that go to in person learning Monday-Friday. Right before school started the school offered her aftercare for her middle two children that she would not have to pay for that would keep them in care while she finished her shift at work. The after care program runs until 5:30 pm and children can be picked up any time up until 5:30. The school would also provide a bus to bring them home every day except Friday if needed.  She decided not to put her children into this program because she felt it would be too long of a day for them to be at school. 

I would have had no problem with her choice except that it has been awful for me since school started. Every single day starting at 3:00 her children start calling their mom here at work because they are fighting, one child will not listen to the older one, and other issues. I then have to stop what I am doing, bring the phone to their mom, and cover her job while she tries to mediate this mess she created at home. Its becoming a daily occurrence at least once but many times two or three times a day! Each time I have to do this makes it take longer for me to get my work finished and its driving me crazy. 

I had a meeting with this woman two weeks ago to tell her that this arrangement isn't working and that I cannot keep having her kids call here all the time. I offered to reach out to the school on her behalf to see if they would allow her children to do the aftercare program because the current situation is not working out. She said she would think about it and a week later when I asked her about it again she said she still did not want to put her kids into aftercare. Another week passed and another 10+ phone calls and ive had enough. I told her yesterday that i was going to have to send her home an hour early every day so she could go be with her kids when they get out of school. She would still be full time at 35 hours, still get PTO and paid holidays. I told her that if she found an adult to care for her kids after school or put them into aftercare she could have her hours back but until then effective immediately she would be leaving an hour early every day. Two hours later her kids were enrolled im aftercare and the problem was solved. Now the rest of my staff (after only hearing her side of the story) are saying I was too harsh and that it wasn't fair of me to mess with her money situation. I felt that it was my only option in order to make things go the way they need to in the workplace. So reddit, AITA?",0
"This is a throwaway acc, so I won’t reveal my age or use real names. 

There’s a popular girl from school who we’ll call L that started posting a lot on tiktok. Some of the posts said things like “I’ll go under your desk while you play video games” and “forget pinning me in your messages, pin me against a wall.” I found this weird because the boy, who we will call J,  that the posts are about is creeped out by this. He finds L to be weird and nasty. On top of the tiktok posts, L made comments about him and another boy named Chris having “hot and big hands” she obsessed over their hands for over 3 months. I have no problems with girls having crushes, but that’s too far. 

On top of her obsession, she thinks she’s so much better than everyone else and likes to talk bad about people who have been nothing but nice to her. If she doesn’t like those people, she should outright say it. 

One day, I decided to confront her. I know it’s not my mess to deal with but I knew J wasn’t going to speak for himself. I told her that she was disgusting and creepy for making comments and posts about a guy who clearly doesn’t like her. I pulled up the screenshots and told her how weird it was to make posts like this knowing the guy is disgusted by it. She messaged back and we got into a sort of argument. Her friends think I’m an asshole but I think I needed to put her into her place, although I could’ve been nicer about it. So, am I the asshole?",0
"My son is 16. His girlfriend is too. They’ve been dating for about a year. 

When they started dating it was normal and appropriate. Then, over the last several months, I’ve noticed strange behavior, especially around her. 

He’s usually really talkative and emotive and energetic but he‘s kind of withdrawn whenever she’s around. She’d answer questions for him and finish his sentences, too. 

I didn’t think much of it at at first. But then I realized he wasn’t spending time with his core group of friends anymore. Turns out it was because his girlfriend said he wasn’t “allowed” to see them without her.

He wasn’t going out and doing things he used to enjoy. I asked him about it and he said his girlfriend didn’t think they were “cool” things to be doing (she sold his skateboard, she threw out all his drawings.) 

We had a talk about not changing yourself to please others and I thought she was a bitch but it was all normal teenage coming of age stuff. 

Recently, I was on the road for work, and he had on a date with this girl so I texted to ask how it went. He didn’t reply. I followed up to be sure he made it home, he called and said he couldn’t reply over text because *she reads all his messages* and asked me to not ever text him about her. 

I told him that was a red flag, but he said that when things are good with her they’re really good so he’s fine to put up with her when things are bad. 

I’m a single mom, so I thought maybe I was being too overprotective of the whole situation, and I just needed to stop interfering. 

But on that same trip I called again to ask how a visit to his aunt had gone and he said he didn’t go because his girlfriend feels like he spends too much time with his family lately. 

I advised him that wasn’t her decision to make and if he felt like he spent too much with family, that was one thing, but he needed to learn to tell her “no” and if she couldn’t handle it she didn’t deserve him. 

He said he couldn’t do that because he was afraid of what she would say and she’s unpredictable when she gets “in a state.”

I was still at crossroads because I know he’s at an age where he needs to problem solve for himself. But a male coworker couldn’t help overhearing us talk and he said, “Just consider, if you had a daughter instead, would you be letting a boyfriend treat her like that?” 

I hadn’t thought of it like that. So when talking didn’t work, I eventually banned them from being alone together and took her off his social media so she can no longer monitor it. 

A lot of men who I trust to give me “single mom parenting advice” are saying this was an asshole move, because my son is not in any danger and needs to learn not to let girls push him around just to get his rocks off. 

But the parenting instinct in me said this was a double standard placing him at risk. But maybe they’re right and it’s actually just be overprotectiveness, in which case I’m the one who’s making things worse. I’m at a loss. AITA?

Edit; Thank you so much for all these replies. I’ve been too overwhelmed too answer everyone individually but I’m so touched and really really appreciate all of you!",0
"I'm a college student making some extra money babysitting this summer. I was staying at this family's house in a different neighborhood I wasn't familiar with, with their 4 year old and 6 year old for an evening.

I was getting them ready for bed and I heard shots. I told the kids that it must be fireworks. I just got them in bed on the side of the house that wasn't near the street and sat quietly in their room for a bit until they were alseep. I heard some knocking on the door and I didn't move even when the guy called out that it was the police and wanted to talk.

Now to some of y'all, that might seem weird. Especially if you have police forces that are trustworthy. But I grew up in a country where the police were outwardly agreesive and dangerous to bring around. Calling the police on any kind of crime against a woman was a surefire way to get a second crime done that night. So I was taught early by my mom to never call police, just go to sleep. If they come around you didn't see or hear shit, you were sleeping. 

My family moved to America when I was 13 and learned that while the police in our area pretend like there a more formal safe organization they're no different than the ones back home. Even worse because at least at home everyone knows they're corrupt and won't tell them anything or help them with anything. But here, some people believe the air of respectability they put on and aid them. It's a rougher area I'm living in and I can say for certain that I've never seen a cop protect or serve the community.

So for me it was the most obvious thing ever that you don't come to the door if the cops knock. Like that's just generally accepted (in the places I've lived) as the stupidest shit you can do

I found out when the parents came home that that's not universal. They live in a rich neighborhood and I guess they actually do feel protected and safe with their police. But I didn't know that so when the mom came in and asked what was going on on the street, I said I don't know, I didn't see anything. 

She said I must have noticed all the sirens and lights and I said ""Yeah, I saw there were cops around, one knocked. I don't know what it's about""

She asked me what he had to say and I said like it was the most obvious thing in the world ""I don't know, I didn't come to the door"" 

She got angry and asked why I wouldn't go see what was happening and talk to the officer. I was honestly incredulous, to me it was obvious. 

I didn't explain myself well since I was so incredulous and said ""Why would I?"" In a ""what the hell are you thinking"" kind of tone.

She said I should leave and that she didn't want me watching her kids again. I had to argue with her to just get paid but she eventually did but tipped like shit.

I'm curious about an outside opinion...

AITA for not opening the door and not asking questions when I was babysitting and the police came around?

Edit... Some of y'all seen to be missing some context. If you are asking yourself ""Wait why is talking to the police dangerous?"" and really don't know, I'd recommend this video by a lawyer explaining it well. 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE

And if you're planning on commenting something along the lines of ""haha scared silly little girls scared of nothing like an idiot"" or ""scared little baby girls shouldn't be babysitting""  ... I'm sure nothing I can say is going to convince you I'm not just a scared stupid girlie. But maybe you'll understand if a big man with a big boy job like a lawyer explains it to you. So watch that video before you go telling me I'm dumb.",0
"Ok, so there's a lot of backstory here to cover, and because of character limits, I can't cover all of it. I'll answer any questions in the comments.

My dad (D) was mostly absent or abusive during my childhood, military family. When I was 23 he started an affair with his now wife (W). My mom was upset and died when I was 24 while going through the divorce. D married W 10 months after my mom died. He had proposed months before she died. It was messy to say the least. 

I have been LC with D since I moved out. Its only gotten lower since. I decided to allow a relationship with my daughter and D/W. But I limit it, she is never alone with them.

When I met my now husband (H) (not my daughters dad) I tried to establish a LC relationship between them. We went out to dinner the first time they met and it was bad. W was drunk before we arrived. She asked the same 4 questions about 5 times each and then, like a light flipped, she accused H of using me, being a liar, ect ""Shes a God fearing woman and grew up in (this place in the south) and knows how to spot a liar"" 

Basically she was drunk. It got awkward. H thanked them for their time, and apologized for any wrong ideas they may have and we left. 

I later told D that W needed needed to apologize as what she said was uncalled for. She texted me to apologize, H accepted and he wanted to just go on and pretend it didn't happen and not make a big deal about it. They wouldn't allow this and insisted that he had to go to dinner with them so that they could apologize and talk about it. He didn't want to, I didnt force him.

They ended up not coming to my daughters bday party because he still hadnt accepted their apology the way they wanted him to. So we went NC for 7 months through the holidays. 

I broke the NC to tell D happy birthday. I started talking to them again, had dinner with them and my daughter. H didn't come because he still felt unwelcome. I didn't force him.

I had been LC with them for the last 6 months. 

H and I decided to get married on Halloween at the courthouse. I told D/W the date and the time. I told the same thing to my MIL. We didn't specifically invite anyone, but MIL begged to be there. We honestly thought we'd just get married and not make a big deal about it. But we were not against anyone coming if they wanted to.

Well this last weekend my car had a flat tire, and I called some friends for a ride so I could get a new one. I only have one car. Everyone was busy. I tried MIL, they were busy. I finally tried D, he was busy.

I got my car towed, problem solved. That night at 2am I got a ranting text from D that he felt insulted/was pissed off that I'd ask him for help but not invite him and W to my wedding, yet I invited my MIL and stepdad. And that the only way to fix this was for both me and H to apologize to him.

That was 3 days ago, I have not responded. I'm starting to feel a bit guilty for not specifically inviting him. 

So AITA for not inviting him?",0
"For context, this was at 1:30am, I (19f) work night shifts and was on my way to work. I also have back pain due to an accident I had a year prior that left me with severe chronic back pain if I stand for too long. 

I got on the bus this morning to head to work and a big group of people (all family) get on the bus with a really young child. 2 of them had gotten on the bus with the child before me (pushed passed me to get on first which I found rude personally) and then I got on and sat down in an available seat. After about a minute of the 2 women and child standing trying to find a seat the kid wanted to sit in she wanted my seat. The woman came up to me asking me to move to a different seat because her kid wanted that seat. I told her no as there was plenty of seats (as you can imagine the bus isn’t very busy at 1:30am) and I was already sat down. The kid started getting angry and the woman said “but you can just move my child wants this seat and she won’t sit down anywhere else.” Again I said no because I was already sat down and my back was in quite a bit of pain then the woman got angry with me said I was being rude and should just let her child sit there because that’s where she wanted to sit. 

Now am I the AH for this because, if circumstances were different and the bus was full, I would’ve been fine to give up my seat and sit next to someone else but because there was so many free seats and my back was in a lot of pain, I really didn’t want to move if I didn’t have to.

EDIT: there was 7 people in total, 2 children and 5 adults. Just to clear it up for anyone saying she was struggling with her child alone",0
"My ex and I were together for about 9 years, and broke up about 1 year ago, but we still have good relationship and some investments together were we are 50/50. A few years after I moved into her house our bed broke and she blamed me. She had this bed before we met and told me that it was me who was really the cause. In 2020 I purchased a new ottoman bed for us (with storage underneath) for £350 and we used it for about 2 years until we broke up. She continued to use it after we broke up, and is using it now.

The bed was not working correctly. There was something wrong with the hinges or it wasn't closing properly and she contacted me last week to ask me if I received a refund from the bed company because she told them that the bed was faulty and they agreed. They sent the refund to the card that was used for purchase, which was mine. She also told me that I need to transfer the money to her so that she can buy a bed for herself since I 'broke' the other one.

I told her that she can buy her own bed now since we are not together and she is the one that is going to be using it. She told me that the bed was a replacement for the one I broke originally. I told her that she will have to buy her own bed. AITA?

Update: I offered her to pay for the new bed that she chooses up to the amount of refund, but she said that she would rather have the money. I have a feeling that she will just keep the bed and wants the money as well. So I just told her that I will keep the money until she is ready to purchase a new bed up to the refund amount. ",0

"I(32F) and my husband(33M) have 2 kids(2F and 8M). I'm a SAHM and my husband earns more than enough for us to live comfortably so we felt it would be beneficial for me to stay home with the kids. 

Our families have always been very supportive throughout our marriage and we're ever so grateful about it. However, my husband's sister is not as supportive as the rest of his family is. She keeps making comments about our parenting choices and me staying at home. 

She says that my kids are old enough to be left with a sitter now and I should start looking for a job etc. The thing is I still breastfeed my daughter and I plan on continuing until she weans off on her own. I have consulted with multiple pediatricians and they've all said that she's in perfect health and breastfeeding isn't doing her any harm. 

Yesterday, my husband's parents had come to our home for dinner. After dinner, I went to put my daughter to bed. Before she goes to bed, she usually breastfeeds for about 5 mins. While I was breastfeeding, my SIL walked into the room asking me if I wanted some ice cream. When she saw me feeding my daughter, she started saying that it's not healthy etc. I tried telling her that My daughter is going to sleep and we can talk about this later but she refused to comply.

My daughter was about to fall asleep and I didn't want her to wake up so I told my SIL to get out of the room. She was shocked for a minute then stormed out of the room. When my daughter had fallen asleep, I went out only to see my SIL standing there glaring at me. She started saying how rude it was to tell her get out. I told her that it was none of her business how I parent my kids. 

She started crying and left immediately. My husband's parents and his brother said SIL was in the wrong. But I have been getting angry texts from SIL.

"Two days ago my son got up early and went door to door offering to shovel peoples driveways for cash. I think he made like $75. Well yesterday morning I woke up to someone knocking on my door and was very irritated. When I opened the door a woman was standing there asking when my son was going to come shovel her driveway. I told her I doubted he wanted to get up early two days in a row, so he probably wasn't. She didn't like that answer.

She said she paid my son the day prior to shovel her driveway for three days. This sounded unlikely to me. My son usually doesn't like to commit to things in advance like that. I told her she could come back and talk to him when he was awake. She asked me to wake him up, but I said no, because he's on vacation, so why should he have to wake up early if he doesn't want to. The woman was mad and wanted her $15 back. I told her to come back later and ask my son and just shut the door.

She came back at nine AM, and when my son talked to her he said he never agreed to shovel her driveway multiple days, but that he would do it again for another $15. She was furious and said the price of shoveling a driveway is $5 and she already gave him $15 so he either needed to give her $10 or come shovel her driveway. He said no, he wouldn't shovel a driveway for $5, that's why he told her it was fifteen. If she didn't want to pay fifteen, she should have declined the offer.

She told me to make my son give her $10, and I said no. I said they had a business arrangement, and it didn't involve me, so I don't care how they resolve it. She said I should shovel her driveway then, and I said no, because she woke me up and I have insomnia, and I don't appreciate that. Normally I'd shovel a female neighbor's driveway if she asked and I have time, because I know it can be difficult, but I wasn't inclined to feel charitable towards her at that moment. She asked if I cared at all about the bad spot my son put her in, and I said I didn't, because he can charge whatever he likes for a service, and if she doesn't want to pay, that's not my problem.

She said I am an asshole raising an even bigger asshole, and then she left. I know I wasn't neighborly, but I don't feel like it rises to the level of asshole, because I think she was entitled. But maybe I should have been more empathetic. Am I the asshole?",0
"My girlfriend (f29) and I (m29) were going to host thanksgiving dinner last year, we had everything planned and we invited our closest family members (her parents, my parents, my siblings and my sisters family). Unfortunately we had some health issues concerning my girlfriend's pregnancy, even though she was 31 weeks pregnant just a few days before thanksgiving, she had to have an emergency C-section. I won't go into too much detail with that since it's irrelevant, but the thing is that we cancelled dinner, my gf and our baby had to be in the hospital for a bit. 

My girlfriend and I decided to just stay home during Christmas and new year's eve dinner too, as she was still recovering from the surgery and we honestly didn't feel like doing much. However, since she's feeling better now she thought that it would be a good idea to have a family dinner now, to make up for all of our missed holidays this year. 

Long story short, we planned a dinner for yesterday. My girlfriend and I are vegan, usually she doesn't mind too much being around cooked meat, but we prefer to not have it in our home. My sister (f35) is married and has two kids (both boys under 10). 

My girlfriend and I cooked for everyone, and when our families came, my sister's husband asked where the real food was after we told them what we've cooked (all vegan dishes). My gf is a little oversensitive still, so I took my family aside and kindly asked them to not make any harsh comments like that. They said they'll be careful and my sister's husband apologised. 

However, as I was finishing cooking some of our food, someone rang the bell. My sister said ""oh, it must be the delivery for the kids"" and yeah, it was. She had ordered fried chicken for her kids since they surely won't like what my gf and I cooked. That caused a big argument between me and my sister, since she didn't tell me that she was ordering chicken (which I wouldn't have allowed). The discussion escalated and I ended up asking my sister and her family to leave, after that my parents also got upset with me and they left as well. We ended up having dinner just with my in-laws and my brother.

I feel like I did something wrong because now my parents or sister don't want to talk to me unless I apologize for ""being an extremist"", but I was only trying to keep my girlfriend comfortable and happy in her own house? I need different povs here, please",0
"I have two stepsisters and a bio sister. My bio sister, Elia, is getting married soon. Our oldest stepsister, Hannah, hadn’t met Elia’s fiancé until this recent incident as she lives in Dubai and we live in London.

Elia’s future in-laws hosted an engagement party for them which Hannah came here for. Elia introduced her fiancé to Hannah but then had to leave as her fiancé wanted to introduce her to the other guests. After she left, Hannah kept asking us if that was really Elia’s fiancé. My other stepsister kept saying “I know”. Hannah kept cracking jokes about how Elia managed to trick him into dating her and how they didn’t match as a couple. At one point she said she would’ve thought he would want somebody more at his and his family’s level.

At first, I wasn’t going to say anything to Elia since I know it would just upset her and Hannah claimed to be joking but we’re all going to be bridesmaids and I know it’s going to come with some nice gifts and at least one free trip which I don’t think Hannah deserves after what she said. I told Elia and she was really upset that she started crying. Her fiancé saw and now he doesn’t want either of my stepsisters at the wedding and has uninvited them from all pre-wedding activities.

This has caused a lot of drama in my family and my stepsisters and stepdad are really angry at me. My mum told me that sometimes it’s best not to say anything, especially since I’ve made Elia feel so insecure that she’s trying to convince her fiancé that they should just have a small courthouse wedding.

"So a couple of days ago I was on a birthday of a good acquaintance. I knew almost no one there besides my gf and another friend of mine and we were talking with some dudes about mothers and how much they love their own mothers. I was a little bit drunk, had a good time and was also just carefree. So without thinking to much about it I made a dumb joke along the lines of: ""If I were to hug my mom I'd probably be jailed as a gravedigger."" I didn't say these exact words but it was in a similar taste. Then this dude turns to me and almost seems angry and just says I'd better shut up because that's really distasteful. I felt pretty bummed afterwards and almost a little bit violated because it's just how I grief and someone tried to take that away from me and shame me for it. I just like to make dark humor as a sort of coping mechanism. My mom already died 5-6 years ago and I went to therapy so it isn't recent or anything. I just want to know if I'm the asshole for making a joke about my own dead mother in a situation where I got reminded of death.",0
"I (37M) live with my wife (37F) and son and daughter ( 9 and 11 respectively).

Recently, there has been this kid who comes by our house after playing soccer and either rides his bike or walks over the lawn with his cleats on his way home.

It started out as me giving him stern looks whenever I saw him, then it slowly progressed to me asking him to just go around.

The last time I asked him to stop he made a point to stomp extra hard and twist his feet in to the grass to piss me off.

Since then Ive just been hosing him. The first time I sprayed him with the hose he ran off, but then for some reason he just started standing there while I hose him like he enjoys it.

Its now progressed to me sitting on my lawn chair pointing my hose at him, and him just staring at me while he does so. Sometimes we even make small talk.

Im ngl, it started off as a really bitter relationship, but Ive actually gotten to know the kid quite well, we talk for maybe 15-20 mins everyday, and he doesnt seem to mind being hosed down after sweating hard playing soccer.

He comes by daily and we just shoot the shit while I hose him and he stands there for a bit.

Wife told me I need to stop, even after I explained it to her she said Im making us look like childish idiots.

I guess I could stop, but honestly its really funny waiting for him to come by and I see no harm in it. WIBTA?",0
"I'm a (18F) and I normally only wear bras when I go out, because its uncomfortable, itchy and yk, you gotta let the girls breathe a lil. Yesterday I went to my uncles house for a stay over. once I arrived to the house, I took off my bra as usual and just started to get comfortable. at dinner time, I noticed my uncle and male causin acting a bit weird around me, and my aunt and female cousin were giving me looks I couldn't tell what for. after dinner, my female cousin pulled me aside and asked me why I wasn't wearing a bra. I told her because we are in the house. She told me that my uncle and her brother was in the house too. I got confused and told her so what, I also have a dad and brother at my house, they never cared if I wore a bra or not in the house. she got annoyed and told me to wear it and that I can take it off before sleep and to put it back on once I wake up. I refused and told her I was not going to spend the whole day in my bra. she told me she and her mom does and that I'm being dramatic. I said no again, walked out her room and basically spent the whole night in the guest room where I was gonna sleep. now its morning as I'm writing this, I'm not wearing a bra and both my cousin and aunt gave me annoyed looks and a forced good morning when I said good morning to them. Now I feel a little guilty. Should I just wear the bra? AITA for not?

edit, just so yall know: my breasts arent big. and yesterday the guys only saw me for like an hour while we were eating and I greeted them. nor did they bounce like, at all. and also, I was wearing a black oversized hoodie, they weren't visible, my nipples weren't hard. literally only thing was that they were moving freely.",0
"I (17f) was at family dinner and my uncle (28m) and his wife (24f) were there. For context my aunt is slightly crazy, she claims to be allergic to everything, and normally I would be okay with the allergies until she told me if she didn't like something she would just say she is allergic to it. When she was asked for a full list of what she was allergic to she said her mom had the list and she didn't know. I immediately stopped caring as much about her allergies. 

My mom(40) on the other hand is severely gluten intolerant, like if she gets into it she can't move for days. No one on that side of the family will make any food she can eat. They won't even leave croutons on the side of salads for her. 

I had helped to make my favorite food for dinner, bacon wrapped water chestnuts, and my uncle lost it because his wife is supposedly allergic them. I argued back that water chestnuts are a kind of raddish, not nut and he stopped yelling but they wouldn't touch them. Fine by me, I got more. 

Later on I was eating a chocolate with Nutella in the middle and I gave my siblings (5 and 6) a piece. My uncle lost it at me saying that my siblings were going to be around his wife and make her sick and put her in the hospital. He was yelling but I didn't care. I said something along the lines of why should we tiptoe around your wife's diet, when she doesn't even know what she's allergic, but you don't even care if my mom is able to eat. 

My aunt ran out of the room crying and my uncle started yelling at me. My mom got in the way and came to my defense but the a lot of the family is saying I was in the wrong and should just have stopped eating. My mom told me I did nothing wrong and other family said they hadn't realized my mom couldn't eat the food and that they would do better. 

The family seems torn but I want an outsiders opinion. AITA? 

BTW this is my dad's side of the family and he was away for business.",0
"My girlfriend have been talking about getting a laptop for a long time. I offered her mine because I don’t use it but she said it was old and slow.

So for her birthday I got her a new one. She used it for literally two days and then gave it to her sister. When I inquired about the reason she said she didn’t like it and that her sister is going to need it more than her because she’s starting college this fall.

I told her if she wanted to give her sister a laptop she should’ve been the one to buy it. And that you can’t just give away a model that you did a lot of research about because you didn’t like it after trying it for 2 days. I reminded her that we could’ve traded it for a different model or sold it or whatever and got a new one. I told her I’ve been depriving myself from a lot of stuff for 8 months so I could buy the laptop for her so I asked for it back.

She told me that she can’t do that because in the US it’s rude to ask for gifts back, and since the laptop was a gift I can’t ask her for it back and same goes for her with her sister after she gifted it.

I think it’s more rude to pretend for months to want something just so you could give it to someone else shortly after you receive it unless there was a valid reason like the gift requiring money or maintenance or receiving similar gifts.",0
"I have had a ‘friend’ staying with me since November. The plan was supposed to be from December, so she could watch my apartment and take care of my cats while I traveled for a month and a bit. She had just lost her job, so I let her stay with me from November instead. I have a one bedroom apartment so she has been sleeping on my couch. The agreement was that she could stay until the end of Jan. To add to this, she had absolutely no money at this point, so I paid her a pet-sitting fee to look after my cats. 

Well, I returned from travels and Jan came to an end… her birthday was in early Feb, I didn’t wanna put a downer on her day, so I didn’t say anything leading up to and the week of her birthday, fully intending to bring it up the week after. 

We got into a bit of an argument over something stupid, and it just so happened to be a couple of days before I told her time is coming up that she needs to go elsewhere - at this point she’d had a job offer, but signing was delayed and nothing was confirmed. So I sat her down mid-Feb and told her that by the end of the month she needs to have made an alternative arrangement. She said she understands and she’d make a plan. A week later she finally gets confirmation about the job, so I am relieved she has something to move on to. 

I am a chronic people pleaser. So giving her a deadline was not easy for me.

Today I asked her if she had made plans and where she was going to go at the end of the week:

Her: no, the people who were available are now no longer available. So I’ll be able to move out at the end of March

Me: I’m really sorry, but no. You need to make some kind of plan

…. She tells me to make a plan for her if it’s so easy, I tried really hard to keep my cool, but eventually a screaming match ensued. She is basically refusing to leave my apartment and I am inches away from having her officially removed by authorities on March 1st.

I have security cameras and rewatched the interaction where she is gaslighting me and calling me crazy and a bully for asking her to leave, she thinks this is all about the initial argument and “everything was fine before that”. I did turn into a bit of a psycho - screaming was happening from both sides. But never once did she ASK if she could stay another month, she just stated it, as if it was her call.

I have been working hard in therapy to be more assertive with my boundaries. I hate the thought of hurting someone, but this situations feels toxic and detrimental - I am physically anxious and uncomfortable in my own home. She has no money, but she has tons of friends, I can’t be the only one with a couch right? I’ve given her four months of rent free, utility free living, shes helped herself to my groceries, I’ve lent her a phone because hers got stolen. 

So… am I the asshole for not changing my mind here?

Context* we’re both expats in a country without our families, there are no shelter type places that could accommodate her.",0
"I know it sounds mean, but my BiL seems to be really discriminatory towards us for being a straight couple. 

I am bisexual, but fallen in love with a man I'm going to marry. My brother and his husband were friends with my ex girlfriend. I'm still friends with her, she's lovely, but we didn't work as a couple.

For 5 years now I've been dating, uh, let's call him Jack  We've decided to get married in August and have been planning for a while. 

The wedding is not big, < 50 total guests, and we were going to give everyone in the bridal and uh, groominal (?) parties a +1, but no one else. 

The thing is, my brother is one of my bridesmen (I have a MOH and 3 bridesmen, my husband to be has a best man and mixed sex party).  

This last weekend I went over to my family to hang out. Cousins played board games, all the adults had drinks, typical big family hang out. But my BiL was a bit too drunk and said some shitty things. And it's not the first time I've heard them, just the first time in maybe half a year. 

He said that I was a traitor to our people for marrying a straight white man (we're white lmao). He said I broke up with my ex because I was ashamed of being a faggot. He also was comparing my fiancee with my ex (why would you date such an ugly man after such a pretty girl, he's so poor, you had a rich gay girlfriend ( not true, we're all middle-class) ). 

Eventually my brother took him home and my fiancee took me home. 

I told him the next day if he couldn't apologize to us as a couple, and stop being so hetero phobic, he couldn't come to our wedding. My brother is saying he was just drunk and he'll behave. And our family is backing him up and telling me to let it go.

But I have yet to get an apology from BIL. My brother is threatening to not be in the wedding party, and I would hate that. But I would hate including his shitty husband in my wedding more. I told brother I'd save him a piece of cake if he doesn't come. 
 

Am I the asshole for insisting BIL cannot come without an apology? To both me and my husband to be?",0
"I (37M) am single, childfree and have two dogs (German Shepherd mixes). They are very well behaved and super nice, my niblings (aged 2-13) love them. 

I have 4 sisters and they have 10 kids total, so I babysit A LOT. I work from home and am pretty much always available to watch the older ones (since I can easily work while they are in my appartment) and when they need care for the little ones, I just move my schedule around a bit. 

Yesterday 4 of my niblings were at my place (ages 3, 5, 7 and 8). 7 and 8 are siblings. 

I have just one super strict rule at my house: no chocolate. It's deadly for dogs, I don't like it anyway and kids can easily go an afternoon without it. 

The 7 and 8yro obviously brought chocolate with them and shared with 3 and 5yro. I was in the kitchen making them drinks, they were in the living room. My dogs were sleeping on the balcony. 

I came into the living room and there were obviously chocolate crumbs everywhere. I asked who had the chocolate and 7 and 8yro admitted that mom gave it to them and they always have some with them, but usually eat it in secret. 

When my sister came to pick them up a few hours later, I told her what happened and she said that her kids are big enough not to make a chocolate mess. I told her I'm never babysittinv for her again.

She is furious and says I overreacted. Another sister of mine agrees with her. My mother thinks I am wrong for putting my dogs before the children.

"This happened a few month ago. My husband and I have been trying to have a baby. We finally got pregnant and we’re so excited. We had planned to tell my parents and his family on thanksgiving since my parents live far away and would be in town. His parents are divorced and don’t get along and we would be telling his father separately. 
Unfortunately my dad broke his ankle and had surgery a few days before thanksgiving so my parents couldn’t make it. My husband and I decided to just do thanksgiving with his family.
The first thing that happened was his mom trying to force alcohol down my throat as soon as I walked in the door. I pushed it off with a laugh that I hadn’t eaten all day and might have one with dinner. She didn’t know I was pregnant yet.
His family was sitting around the table and we were talking about work and catching up on life events when our of nowhere my MIL says “maybe your parents didn’t come this year because your dads beating your mom” me”what?” She shrugged “maybe your dads really beating your mom and they don’t want you to see the bruises.” I’m dumb founded, but brush her off. My mom is a very strong woman and would never let a man lay a hand on her and my dad would never be the man to raise his hand to a woman.
We all ignore MIL and talk amongst ourselves. Drinks get poured and they star making light fun that I’m not drinking. I make a few drunk jokes at my expense and my MIL gets angry thinking in her narcissistic mind that I’m talking about her.
She gets up glares at me and throws her drink in the sink and storms off. All of us are confused but know she prone to being dramatic and let her have her fit. 
She wouldn’t sit with us at dinner and refused to speak with me for the rest of the night.
My husbands plan was to put the ultrasound picture in his favorite childhood book and give it to her. He handed it to her and she cooed over it saying “aw this was your favorite. I used to read this to you all the time” and my husband was getting excited.
She opens the book, sees the ultrasound picture and her face falls and goes “oh, congrats.”
My husband, confused and dejected, says “congrats? That’s all I get?” MIL gets up and gives him a hug before pushing the ultrasound picture into his hands and sulks on the couch. 
Later in the car my husband was disgusted by his mom. This wasn’t the first thing she had done to him over the years and their relationship is strained. I said I don’t want her in my life, but my husband can take baby to see her whenever he wanted without me. He says he’s okay with that and doesn’t know if he wants her in our child’s life. But would that make us the ahole?",0
"Sorry if this is a bit of a rush, have a lot to do and I need opinions, my brother has told me that im being a jerk for not coming with her again but I can’t do it anymore,I want to share my situation and get your thoughts. Growing up, my birth father was abusive and my older sister left to live with our grandparents. Soon my father went to jail finally and my mum fell in love with a man who acted like he cared but treated us poorly, constantly criticizing me about how much I eat, what I do, how I do things and just all the little things I’m insecure about, I’ve talked to them about how I feel but they say they’ll stop but it hasn’t and. I’ve gotten tired of taking everyone’s crap. 2 weeks ago we came down to my grandparents which is a few days worth of driving and after my sister found out she helped me tell my grandparents, I broke down to my grandparents about how I've been feeling and they offered for me to live with them, which I accepted. Now I feel guilty for leaving my friends, family, and my mom behind. Am I the asshole for not wanting to go back to my hometown with my mother?",0
"Hey guys, my mom and I have been fighting recently and I want to know if I’m in the wrong in this situation.

For context, I’m the eldest of 4, and I guess I was sort of the “problem child” growing up. We’re all very close in age and I think to be honest I acted out to get attention, but my parents were always harder on me because I was their first. I would just sort of deliberately disobey them and lie and I hate that I acted like that but feel like I’ve definitely moved on from that.

I love my mom very much. I’m at college and we usually speak a couple of times a week. I feel as though she trusts me with what’s going on in her life and asks me for my opinion about things (which is nice and makes me feel more like an adult). The problems always arise when I go home. I try and be as helpful as I can around the house, I cook dinner, clean up, do all my own laundry, walk the dogs etc. I think living with others has taught me to be a good housemate (I’ve never had any problems with people I lived with). 

Most recently, we got into a huge blowout because I didn’t fold up some laundry I took out of the dryer. It was mine and my siblings clothes, and I remember thinking “oh I should fold that to help out” but I was also going to walk the dogs so I thought “I should do that first” and forgot to come back to it. 

She confronted me about it but she always does it in this aggressive tone. It’s not “please could you remember to fold the laundry” it’s more like “you deliberately didn’t do it to make my life difficult” (not her direct words but what she’s implying). I don’t react well to this and I really try to stay calm but it just rubs me up the wrong way, especially as I don’t address her like that (and she would be PISSED if I did).

I said sorry and explained myself but definitely sounded defensive and the whole situation just escalated into her saying I’m self-obsessed and don’t care about anyone except myself which honestly is really hurtful and something she says quite often, even though I feel as though I really try to make an effort to be helpful. It got worse and I basically was sobbing saying is there even any point in me coming home if that’s what she really thinks.

My other siblings don’t fight with her like this but I think they’re less reactive when she confronts them about stuff. I think maybe it’s also me being more independent now and not being used to having anyone talk to me like that. I really try not to be reactive but sometimes I just am because my intention is never to make her life hard and it’s frustrating that she thinks that. I think she’s also the hardest on me (which she has admitted to).

Am I the asshole in this situation for talking back to her? What could I do better?",0
"I (21M) have been having a series of arguments with my mother (54F) for the past 8 months now. The topic has been about trying to keep the house clean. I've known for a while now that I can be a bit of a neat freak but I don't think I'm being unreasonable this time.

It all started eight months ago, mother had bought bananas to start eating as a snack for breakfast. The problem is that she would forget to throw them away, Usually leaving sitting in her office for 3-5 weeks before I noticed flies swarming in the room and cleaned up whatever food waste was in there.

I would ask her to clean them up, or stop eating bananas while I took care of the flies, but she always said ""well they don't bother me."" and that was the end of the conversation.

About four months ago the flies started getting worse, we had continued arguing about cleaning her office, when I suggested we buy some fly trap(paper, ribbon, etc) she said they weren't needed and ended the conversation.

The reason I'm making this post is because over this weekend I found bags of rotting potatoes, tortillas,and even more banana peels scattered throughout the common areas of the house, even worse the fact that the banana peels were buried under a mountain of used tissues.

I also discovered that the flies are in every room of the house now, the bathroom, the loft, maggots on the mirror, even crawling up through my bedroom carpet. I just feel so disgusted living in this house. I can barely sleep with the flies constantly buzzing around my face at night.

About an hour ago I confronted mother about this again and she seemed confused why I was upset, I just told her i'm exhausted of the constant flies and she brushed me off like it was nothing. I feel like I have a right to living in a clean house Where I don't have to clean up after another person, but at this point I don't know if i'm overreacting or not so, Reddit AITA?

"Okay, I know how this sounds. Please hear me out at least.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 11 years, since I was 15. His mother has HATED me since the first day she met me. She hated me due to my ethnicity, (Kosovan Albanian) she hated me due to my career, I work as a model and she decided that makes me an empty headed, vain, shallow person. Then when I told her I still planned to go to university alongside my career she said I was doing it to “impress” my boyfriend. I’ve since left uni with a distinction and her new reason to hate me is… I try too hard? She has also insisted I’ve cheated on him throughout our entire relationship which is a ridiculous claim, I’ve never even kissed another man in my whole LIFE. I have zero desire to cheat and never will.

Late last year she attempted to void the insurance on my boyfriend’s motorbikes, she tried to do this under my name so, hypothetically, when he was arrested for riding with no insurance and called his insurance company, I’d get the blame. After this happened my boyfriend and I agreed to cut her out, however it hasn’t stuck, she left my boyfriend alone and respected his wishes for NC but she’s continued to contact and harass me.

This leads to the last few weeks, my boyfriend works as a motorcycle test rider and he got in an awful motorbike crash while working, as such I now need to care for him. I’m okay with that and I’m focusing on seeing it as an opportunity for us to get closer, it’s been nice honestly. However his mother has been AWFUL to me. She’s called me litany of terms. From things as tame as stupid to things as awful as a “Nasty Serbian half breed.” I’m not Serbian and she’s well aware that calling a Kosovan a Serb is offensive. I tried to block her so she started making new iMessage accounts and began to continuously harass me via those accounts.

Then came Friday night. The police turned up at our door. I was pretty confused and was quickly told they were there to do a welfare check as they’d received “multiple” claims of horrific abuse I was apparently putting my poor boyfriend under. Obviously they quickly discovered he was fine, albeit grumpy and they left. I know for a fact it was his mother, some of the details the police mentioned made that obvious. 

I’m now at a point where I’ve realised I literally cannot do this. I’m going to press charges against her for the insurance and harassment (it’s a crime in the UK) and I’m likely going to sue her for damages, for the sake of my mental health I need to do this. I don’t want to be a victim and she needs to be forced to stop. I have mentioned my intentions to her if she doesn’t back off and she’s pretty much mocking me and saying I won’t. I absolutely will. I just feel like this morally may make me an awful person. She sucks, I know this, however she’s old and miserable enough as is and I feel like doing this may ruin whatever small amount of life she has left. It feels like it may be too far. I really don’t know though and I genuinely cannot be objective here.

WIBTA here if I did this?

Edit: When I say I need to care for my boyfriend, I mean he’s essentially immobile, he’s not being unsupportive, he’s just barely able to take care of himself, let alone battle his mother too.",0
"My friend’s mom has always hated me. She made it very public and my friend even told me that her mom does not like me at all. She’s always thought I’m too mature for my age even though she thinks the world is still in 1960. Currently I’ve been talking to a guy I really like and I’ve also told my parents and they fully support. I also told my friend this but I didn’t tell her that I told my parents. She promised not tell anyone even her mom. But she did. The next time her mom and I met, her mom screamed at me and told me I was a disgrace to my parents , dating at such an age. I’m currently in 12th grade and my parents are fine with me dating now. I told her mom in a very rude tone tbh that she shouldn’t care about my life since I’m not her daughter and that she should care about her daughter and her relationships instead of mine. In truth my friend has been in a relationship since 8th grade and her parents don’t know. Her mom called me a liar and went inside my house and told my parents which resulted in them telling her that they knew and that she should fuck off. I actually had a lot of proof against my friend but I didn’t stoop as l as to send them to her.",0
"My (18F) family has a “tradition” that goes back 5 generations, and that is the oldest of the family joins the military (only the 4 main branches). My mom was in the army and retired as a major, my grandpa was in the Air Force and retired as a Colonel I believe, my great grandpa was in the Navy, my great great grandfather was a marine, and my great x3 grandfather was also a Marine. My family is VERY proud of this fact and has been throwing this in my face since I was fresh out the cooter.

With the school year coming to an end and I turned 18 last month, my mom has been forcing me to do fitness courses and buying textbooks to help me study for the ASVAB. Now I would have rebelled against this awhile ago but sadly my younger brother past away a few years ago and it was really hard on my parents so I’ve just been going along with this until now. Last week, I overheard my mom talking on the phone to a recruiter talking about my options for possibly becoming an officer. I guess the realization finally hit. I told my mom I’m not joining a few days ago and a huge fight happened. But I basically “wasted her time” and she called me a disappointment but I think I have a right to choose.

"

I (female-American 37) met my fiancè (Male 46 Canadian-Lebanese) 3 years ago. He has a 23yo daughter ""Najwa"" She was heavily against her parents separating which I had nothing to do with cause I met him 2 years after the separation. Najwa and I seemed to be doing pretty good getting along first but then she started doing things like damaging my car and legal documentations (she damaged my pasport to prevent me from traveling with her dad and threw away my dogs food) her excuse was always that her mom told her to do those things and was pressured by her. I did my best to let things go and she stopped and we sort of started getting along again until her dad and I announced our marriage date. She literally angerily screamed at us at dinner table but the next minute said ""congratulation"" with huge smile on her face. Her own 34yo, Lebanese-Canadian boyfriend called her ""nuts"".


She came over to her dad's house while I was out and found my wedding dress (I've never been married before this is my first experience ever and I was overjoyed with the dress) and ruined it with paint, literall wall paint she brought with her. She wasn't there when I got home but the door cam revealed everything. I had a very negative reaction I confronted her and she still denied. I made a police report but got talked into letting it go since her boyfriend paid for the dress.

Everything was expected to go back to normal but I was done with her (she didn't even apologize) and am now discussing filing for a restraining order against her cause this was the last straw. Her dad found out about the pitential RO and disagreed completely and said I went over the top by even considering it but she's an adult and she ruined hundreds worth of dollars and she should face the consequences. Where does it stop?. He insisted I let it go cause he wants her at our wedding and an RO will prevent her from being there. He said I already got paid for the dress and he'll get her to apologize if I wanted but I still refused. He told me to at least wait until after the wedding then do whatever cause he really wants Najwa there and called me cruel to dismiss how important that is for him. It got too much for me and I told him I could've made things worse and had her charged but I just want her to stay away and asked him to respect my decision. he said I was unreasonable to think he'd support me in this and begged that I reconsider cause this will ruin his relationship with her forever.

I feel like morally I could be wrong since she's my stepdaughter and we are family I think this might ruin the relationship between us (her, her dad, and my inlaws). Who are begging me not to do this.

Eta my fiance has always been supportive of me and helped me so much while struggling and he's unlike the family. He's kind and understanding.",0
"My husband and I are in our early forties and our youngest girl is 8 years old. My husband is a bit of a people pleaser and sometimes does it at my expense. I usually don't fuss about it because more frequently his generosity is directed towards me and our family, so I ignore the occasional annoyance. However, this time my husband is convinced that I am in the wrong and is upset at me and that pisses me off.

The issue in question is the upcoming wedding of one of his friends. He met this guy at work and this friend has had some personal tragedies in his life that made him lonely and depressed and my husband was a huge support for him. While they are good friends and I have met him a few times socially, we are simply pleasant acquaintances. Friend started dating a woman a little over a year ago and a few months ago they got engaged and then quickly set the wedding date. 

My husband was asked to be the best man. He checked with if that was ok and I asked him to not commit to spending much since we are on a tight budget for now. A few days later the fiance asked my husband if our youngest daughter could be the flower girl and he checked with me if that was ok and I agreed to it. The way they jumped from a quick engagement to a quick wedding, I assumed this was a simple backyard wedding with a few close people and my daughter will be with my husband the entire time. I never got an invite to the wedding which added to my assumption that this was a small affair. 

I found out it was a big fancy wedding when my husband admitted that he paid $200+ for a tux rental picked out by them and that our kid will need a fancy dress. I backed out of allowing my kid in the wedding party then. The bride and groom offered to pay for the flower girls dress and her hair and makeup (??!!). That weirded me out even more and I said I am not comfortable sending my kid with people I don't know, with a bride I have never met, at a wedding I am not even invited to. Husband says I am over protective of my kid and if I am that concerned then I can accompany her. I find that absurd, what exactly am I going to be doing hanging around as my kids attendant?! I don't even understand why the bride wants to borrow some kid for this event instead of using someone she knows, I mean she's having a huge wedding party, surely there is someone there she can put in her pictures.

A few weeks later the groom asked my husband to be a groomsman instead of best man. Husband was a bit irritated but he doesn't really mind and thinks that this happened because of my behavior.

"My(35M) sister(25F) loves stiletto heels. A bit of backstory, my sister and I are very close, last month my wife (34F) and I hosted a birthday party for her at our house. One of her friends wore heels worn down to the metal nail, denting our floor. My sister noticed an hour into the party and told her friend but the friend was unwilling to take them off and only did so reluctactantly after prodding. I told my sister to worry about it later, but after the party we saw the entire living room was covered in deep dents. However thanks to my sister getting her friend to take her heels off we avoided too much damage in the kitchen and hallway.

There was a lot of drama within my sister's friend group afterward. Turns out the friend knew her heels would leave dents but wore them anyways and she didn't care at all about the floor damage she caused. My sister tried to get her to pay the repair bill, but the friend smirked, said that she was just making our floors look “lived in” and my sister should be the one paying for rudely making her take off shoes that made her outfit. My sister was livid and ended the friendship immediately. She felt terrible, blamed herself for inviting that friend, and said she would pay for repairs. My wife and I said no as it wasn't her fault and she also prevented any more damage from occurring by noticing before anyone else had, and we comforted her and don't blame her.

My wife, sister, and I are holding a Christmas party, and my wife and I decided to ban heels. My sister asked us to let her still wear stilettos, as she makes sure they are in good condition and not damaging (which is true, she lived with us for 2 years before moving out, visits often, and never left a single dent even though she always wears heels the entire time), but we feel having my sister wear heels while having a heel ban for guests would be bad. My sister isn't inviting the former friend who wrecked the floors or anyone remotely supportive of her actions, but we feel the potential for damage is too great still if someone unintentionally wears worn out heels. My sister is very upset by this as she hates wearing anything but stilettos, and this is a party where everyone will dress up.

She suggested telling guests to check their heel tips weren't missing, and that she would inspect their shoes to make sure they wouldn't cause damage, but we feel that this is too tacky. She also said she would pay for fixing the floor should damage occur, again offered to pay the previous repair bill, but we don't want this as my sister earns less than we do and the repair would be very costly for her, plus repairs are inconvenient. My sister has been begging us to let her wear heels to the party, and tearfully asked if we wanted to punish her for the damage from her birthday party, but that isn't the case at all. However, I understand how much this hurts her, and I wonder if we should let her wear the shoes she wants or just remove the high heel ban. AITA?",0
"My daughter invited me to her fiance's birthday dinner. I don't know him very well or his interests. They have been dating less than a year. I wrote him a check for $100 and a card saying I'm excited that he is joining the family and looking forward to getting to know him better.

The next day my daughter and I were chatting and she asked if I didn't like her fiance. I said I did. She said it hurt her feelings that I just gave him a check when I gave her brother's boyfriend an expensive subscription to a cheese of the month club for his birthday a few months ago and they aren't even engaged. She said it felt like I was expressing disapproval.

I told her that marriage and engagement aren't the only important relationship statuses. Her brother and his boyfriend have been together for almost five years and live together. I know him really well and know he loves food and would like the cheese of the month club. I didn't know what her fiance would like. Nothing really stuck out to be as a good idea like the cheese club.

She said it felt like and looked like a lack of effort. I apologized, but I'm still not sure I was really wrong. $100 is hardly a terrible birthday gift. I'm sure by next year I'll know him better and get him something more personal. Also, not to be like that, but she could have helped me out and pointed me in the right direction.",0

I (f37) recently left a job but had a few contacts that would still text me time to time. I consider them acquaintances as we have never hung out or gone to lunch together.  Recently one (m34) had been calling a lot. ( we all had each others numbers from the GroupMe). I did not answer because I was busy and in the past he had admitted he had a crush on me. Since we don’t work together anymore I usually just respond to his texts briefly and he’s been awkward on the phone the one time I did answer. Lately, he has been calling and I would send a text and say , “Hey I’m not available to talk on the phone but you can text.”  To which he replied, “ I really need a friend right now, just answer please, can we meet for dinner?” Being that I’m married 13 years I was not comfortable going to dinner so I expressed I’m only available to text him about his issue and not meet up anywhere.  He still called the next day and texted.  

A week later he called numerous times during a dinner with my family and I responded, “ I cannot answer but ’m free to text.”  He said, “ Cool, I’m dying.”  Unsure of how to respond to this trauma dump, I waited an hour to respond. I did not want to rush a response and risk sounding dry and uncaring. I still did not want to call him.  I sent a long paragraph pulling from experiences I had with ill family members and some optimism and he responded with,  “ Whatever, can’t even call or pick up when I need, thanks for the support.”  I think he thought his dying text would prompt me to call regardless of my stance of only being able to text.  

Note* I believe ITA because I responded to a text of someone clearly grieving with an illness needing support with a text  instead of calling them back after seeing how important it was, and I think something that serious deserves a phone call instead of an impersonal text.


EDIT UPDATE:  My old manager just called and informed me my old co worker unfortunately passed 3 days ago from liver failure from alcoholism.  He was only 34.  He was hospitalized a week after new years.  On New Year’s Day, he only lasted 3 hours at work and left early.  My manager said he was turning more yellow every week and was calling out more after Christmas.  He knew he had health problems, but did not expect to receive a call that he passed this soon.  I feel utterly terrible. He would always bring me drinks and  lunchables to work to make me smile.  I Wish our conversation had gone better instead of the chaotic way it unfolded.  Funeral is Saturday. ",0
"To add to context, my friend H (F,23) is learning French as a part of her studies. She started to gain more readings in French and stumbled across some debate club that post their video on Facebook.

She started to get hook with their contents also get crush on one of the speaker. She started looking at his Facebook profile, Linkedin profile and even manage to find his Instagram. She told me it's a part of her studies but I told her it's extremely creepy. Moreover, the guy noticed she had stalked him on his profile (Linkedin would notify who viewed your profile).

" I took my three year old daughter to her first ever swimming lessons and afterward she saw vending machines and asked for a treat and she wanted a drink. (My older 8 year old daughter often gets Gatorade after her soccer games which the younger one sees) 

She picked vitamin water which I know is not recommended for kids but she’s three and usually will have like 3 sips of anything not water and be done with it.

Anyway we get home and she’s watching a show and my husband asks why she has a vitamin water. I tell him she wanted a treat after swimming and that’s what she picked. He freaks out at me and yells and calls me an idiot in front of our 3 year old that she should never get anything but water EVER And I am ruining her life by giving her a taste for sugary drinks.

I also want to add our older daughter did not get virtually any junk food until much older (except of course at her grandmas where she goes every second weekend and has free access to juice, pop and treats) however, things are different with a second child because she sees her older sister having things and wants the same. 

I also want to add that last weekend on my “sleep in day” I got up and he had fed her ice cream for breakfast so he’s definitely not consistent in applying these healthy rules. It’s only bad when I do it apparently. 

I might be the AH because we did not do this with our first so maybe I am encouraging bad habits at a young age. 

For additional context: we eat very healthy at home. I make everything from scratch and include plenty of veggies which she eats well. We only drink water and milk (and sometimes low sugar chocolate milk). My husband regularly drinks cans of coke but otherwise we are water-only family. 

He got very angry and yelled a lot and called me a bad mom. I remained calm the whole time because I really don’t see an issue with giving kids a few sip of juice now and again. He left the room and sent me a bunch of links about why juice and other drinks are bad for kids, but I know, we do not buy it regularly or keep it in the house.

So Reddit, AITA for giving my three year old vitamin water as a treat?",0
"I'm a 37 year old man. My daughter and her friend (I'll call her Brooke) are both 19. They met in college - they've been friends for almost a year.

Brooke's come over to our house too many times to count and she's always made me uncomfortable. Though she'd never explicitly flirted with me up until a couple days ago, I could always tell she liked me. But because there was no proof and she never made a move, I just tried to ignore it and keep my distance. She seemed like a good kid; never in a million years did I think she'd take it any further than laughing a little harder than necessary at my jokes. 

The other night I got 3 messages from a number not in my contacts. There was one sexually explicit text and 2 faceless nudes. As I was looking at them and trying to figure out who they were from (I thought maybe an old hookup or something), I got a video that included Brooke's face. My heart dropped and I felt sick as soon as I realized what was happening. I was freaked out, and I impulsively ran into my daughter's room and told her. She was freaked out too, and she asked to see the pictures because she couldn't believe it (I know I shouldn't have shown her but I did, it was another impulsive decision). I asked her how Brooke got my number and she said she had no idea. We still don't know - we think maybe she got it off my daughter's unattended phone. My daughter told me she would deal with the situation. I texted Brooke ""please never contact me again"", blocked her number, and left it at that.

The next day, my daughter told me she'd confronted Brooke & it'd caused a huge fight between them. She said that instead of apologizing or explaining herself, Brooke had gotten extremely mad at *me* for telling my daughter what happened. My daughter decided it was best to block Brooke and move on like I had. 

A few hours later, Brooke sent me an Instagram DM (we've never followed each other) that said ""please don't block me, I just want to talk to you"". I blocked her anyway. About four hours after that, I got a long e-mail from her on my work address (it's on my website so I guess that's where she got it?). The email is basically a five paragraph guilt trip. It goes into detail about how embarrassed she is that I showed my daughter ""what was meant for just me"". She talks extensively about how you shouldn't give out private information and how ""if I wasn't interested, I should've just told her and kept her secret instead of going to my daughter"". Never once did she apologize or acknowledge how wrong it was for her to send me those messages. She just tried to make me feel bad.

And honestly...it's sort of working. I don't know; I'm conflicted. I'm still disgusted and angry with her for doing that but I feel bad. Maybe she's just a confused insecure kid with problems and I should have kindly let her know how inappropriate that was and told her not to do it again instead of embarrassing her like I did. AITA? I kind of feel like one but maybe I'm just too empathetic",0
"I was at a relatives house with my family and friends and we were having a small pool party. Anyone I've ever explained this too seems to be shocked at my reaction so I'll just get this out of the way. I have no experience with children. I've never held, talked to, or even been in the same area as a child for longer than a few minutes before this. The toddler's mother was a friend of my aunt.

&#x200B;

I was outside sitting by the pool on a pool chair. At this moment pretty much everyone was inside because a game was on. I was just outside alone by the pool. I don't know how to swim but I had on trunks and enjoy putting my legs in the water. I was on my phone too so I wasn't really paying attention. From like the corner of my eye I see a toddler sprinting away but I didn't think much of it. Everyone seems to think I should see a hint of a child and immediately go into parental mode and stop the child. But my mind didn't even connect. I just continued on my phone then I heard a splash. That's when I looked and saw the kid in the deep end of the pool. I shouted that the kid fell in the pool and someone ran out, jumped in, and pulled the kid out. The kid is fine but the mother and some other people were angry at me and said I should have stopped the kid from getting in. I just said they ran in. The mother also said I should have pulled the kid out but I told her that I can't swim. She seems to think I'm some colossal asshole. It was going on and no matter what I said she would just keep cutting me off and repeat herself and was really whiny. So I just told her that I'm done talking to her. I didn't know her before the day so if this random lady thinks I'm a dick, oh well. I just got back in the chair and ignored her the rest of the day. A few other people are agreeing with her and saying ""you see a child, you just become a alert, it's natural."" If I were walking down the road on a dark night and see a child alone. I'd stop and see to the kid. But this was a party and I didn't think the kid would just jump in. I don't really know how kids behave

&#x200B;

EDIT

I've received a million messages saying I should learn to swim for my own safety.  I grew up poor and never even saw a pool in person until I was like 17. There was no community pool and I'm not about to be the 25 year old in a swim class lol. I have no plans on going boating/fishing any time in life so it's all good

&#x200B;

EDIT2

Lol all the YTA for not learning to swim. I'll take that. I'll be the asshole that never swims

&#x200B;

EDIT3

Want to clarify the situation in more detail. Me seeing the kid and hearing the splash was all within 10 seconds. Just saw the kid out of the corner of my eye while reading on my phone. I'm sure if I was not on my phone and saw a toddler walking around the edge of the pool I would get up and take the kid somewhere else. And as for what happened with the mother. She was scolding me for like an hour and would cut me off. Not let me speak and was being rude. She said ""I don't care if you can't swim you should have jumped in"" and I said that was ridiculous. this went on for an HOUR. I realized there was n hope in this conversation. I don't know this lady and she isn't my friend so I felt no need to make things right. Just said ""I'm not talking to you anymore. You're doing too much"" and just sat down and ignored her. She talked to me for a big more but I just ignored until she left me alone. ",0
"I am getting married in April. It's been very difficult emotionally for me. My father died when I was 8 leaving my mother with 9 children. It was hard growing up seeing her date and realizing just how much my father compensated for her.
My mother has good qualities, but struggles with emotional connection and has some mild narcissistic tendencies. She got remarried in 2021 to P. I've known him since I was 16. I want to be very clear he in no way was a father figure or involved in my life. 
P. has 4 kids of his own. I didn't meet any of his kids until the day of the wedding right before my siblings and I + P’s kids walked down the aisle. 
My mom got married a week before my sister because, quote ""the whole family will be in town and it'll be easier this way"" my sister signed off on it but the whole thing was sort of rushed. 
I moved out as they were getting married, I was 17 and knew I couldn't handle seeing her show up for him in ways she didn't for me. There were other reasons, but that was a big one. 
Eventually I noticed more and more how she would treat P's kids. She was so gentle, attentive, motherly. All the things she struggled with when it came to me.
I asked her why. Why can she be that way with them but not me. She said ""they aren't my kids, P spends so much time with my younger kids he doesn't see his own kids very often. The least I can do is be nice to P's kids. Plus P's kids aren't mad at me like my kids are. I didn't mess up raising P's kids. It's easy with them.""
Back to the wedding. 
My mom is chronically late. She was 4 hours late to my sister's wedding, barely dressed for the ceremony at my other sister's wedding, and was for some reason doing yard work 20 minutes before my brother's wedding. I am refusing to get my hopes up with her for my wedding. I called her and we spoke for 2-3 hours about expectations for the wedding. I want her on time, I want her there to help me get ready. She said these were reasonable and she would do her best. 
When I told her I wasn't inviting P’s kids she asked why. I told her this is the last thing that is mine. My wedding is the last day I will ever have where my mom is still only my mom. Where my family doesn't feel so broken. This day has a lot of emotion, and her with P's kids would add another painful layer.
She said it was unfair of me to not invite them just because of how I think she treats them. She says she doesn't see them very often, but every time she is with them it makes me want to cry about how she treats P's daughters especially. She says my reasons are not based in reality.
I've spoken with my other siblings and thoughts are mixed. Some say I'm overreacting, some say I shouldn't invite mom at all with her track record. I'm just so confused. Would it be better to invite them and cut all expectations of my mom to actually enjoy the day? Am I the asshole to not invite them just because of my mom?",0
"Today my grandfather is having brain surgery and I went with my mother and my grandfather to the hospital. We were put into a waiting room for about an hour. During this hour my mom had her coffee. I went down the hallway to get my own coffee and a breakfast cookie for when my grandfather headed into surgery. He was transferred to another room in the hospital and I was told to wait. When he left I immediately grabbed my cookie and started eat it. Keep in mind, I have been sitting there for a hour with my water bottle. 
My grandfather was asked to fast before his surgery. We were trying to be respectful of him by not eating in front of him. There were others in the waiting room with me as I started to eat my cookie. I’m sitting there scrolling the internet, minding my own when a nurse comes up to me and loudly tells me there is no food or beverage in the waiting area because others are “fasting”. If people know me, they know I am a very thoughtful person and I don’t want to hurt anyone or make people uncomfortable. There were ZERO signs that say we can’t eat or drink in the area. So AITA for eating in front of people without thinking about how others may feel?",0
"16m. Next week I have my end of year party. After the party My friends have planned to eat together in a restaurant and then game at one of their homes (4 minute drive, we'll be walking from school). My parents however refused to allow me, claiming that the end of year party is already enough fun, and that i need to focus on my mocks which will be next month. They think I've grown a ""non-serious"" attitude about my studies because I got a B (79%, one percent off an A) in the mid terms. 

And it's not like this is the first time either. They never allow me to go anywhere because they think this is the type of stuff you do in college or university and that I'm too young, literally everyone else would say otherwise.

My mom never listens to reason and she allowed me to go outside once with a friend to a soccer game (literally the only one instance in the year) and now thinks I'm asking too much and how she worries about my safety and whatnot.

I have my own phone, my own money, all I need is their permission. There's barely 2-3 similar events every year. And she never allows me to go with friends, claiming that I'm too young. Sometimes when my friends ask me to come with them, I don't even tell my mom anymore and just outright refuse knowing she wouldnt allow it. 

Now here's the part about the title. I started studying and she called me to her room. She asked me why my mood is down and that I can tell her . I told her it's down because she doesn't allow me to go out with my friends. She told me again that I should be grateful with what I already have, and not sad about what I don't. How my parents worked hard for my education and that I'm not taking the may June igcse papers seriously. She told me how she can't just trust me to walk with my friends outside when she doesn't even know where I am going. I told her I'd give her my friends address and that id take my phone with me. But still no. After another 10 minutes of her trying to justify her decision, I snapped and told her, it's fine then if you don't want to allow me to go, but then don't expect me to not be fed up about it. She got angry here saying how I'm ungrateful and everything. She then said how the only way she'll allow me to go, is if I take her with me. I might as well just refuse. Nobodys mom is coming with them, she isn't invited either. I have a phone, I'm 16 now, my friend lives close to the school, and my other friends dad is ok with dropping me home. Like what else can I do. At this point I'm just scared of what I might say to her in anger which would ruin my position even further. For example, I barely passed by 2-3 marks in a test recently. And when the test results come out, she will definitely taunt me about how I'm more focussed on friends rather than studies, and that I don't deserve to go to such a big school.

In case you're wondering, yes I have snuck out with my friends to restaurants and stuff after school before, she doesn't know. edit so i don't contradict my above statement:  Ive only snuck out twice to a restaurant close to the school. She never allows me to go to places like the cinema, beach or mall, which is why I outright refuse before even asking her.",0
"I (16F) have a bad relationship with my stepmom. She’s treated me like garbage since she married my Dad and done things I can’t even talk about on this subreddit. 

We were in Washington D.C. not too long ago and i had an allergic reaction to the body wash at the hotel. I had hives covering every single part of my body except my face, because i didn’t use it there. Every. Single. Part. It was painful and itchy and i was miserable. I also sometimes had a little bit of trouble breathing and had a fever.

I begged my parents to at least get me some Benadryl, anti itch cream, or find a fucking doctor, *anything*, but they said they didn’t feel like going out of their way to get some. I was forced to spend three days walking around like this and suffering before they finally got me anything. I still haven’t forgot it.

I wanted to sleep in today because I had a rough day yesterday. My arms ache from my Dance class at school because my teacher had me practicing catching the girls midair all period yesterday and i’m pretty sure i pulled something. My crush rejected me. I was up late studying for my AP class. So yeah, i wanted to sleep in. My mom wakes me up and says she’s having an allergic reaction and I need to do everything for her today. 

I of course go to help, but then I look at her and can’t figure out what’s wrong. I ask her what the allergic reaction was. She says her face is swollen. I take a closer look and see that yeah, it’s a little swollen, but so little that I didn’t even notice at first. She says it’s not itchy or painful, just swollen. I get irritated and go back to bed and she starts screaming at me.

I brought up Washington D.C. and she says that it didn’t matter because I should have just sucked it up and that she really needed my help right now. We got into an argument and I refused to do her responsibilities for her. I told her that when I’m ready to get out of bed, I’ll do my chores and whatever I’m supposed to do (i’m required to do all the cleaning in the house btw).

Anyways, she’s furious now. AITA?",0
"My (57F) BF's (57M) parents were visiting for Easter.  I offered to provide Easter dinner, the precooked meal from Cracker Barrel or Whole Foods, his choice.  The whole dinner would be a done deal, no grocery shopping, no cooking, minimal cleanup, and paid for by me.  BF said no way, a store-bought dinner isn't good enough for his folks, Easter dinner had to be home cooked.  I said fine, if that's your decision, you cook it.  He was extremely angry and said I was being selfish.  So Easter comes, he spends the whole day cooking dinner and is furious with me.  He barely spoke to me the whole day except to deliver some whispered insults and criticisms.

I don't think I did anything wrong. I offered the help I was willing to give, he turned that down.  He insisted I spend my entire Easter Sunday cooking, which I was not willing to do, and got frustrated and angry when he couldn't obligate me into it.

So, y'all, should I have spent my entire Easter Sunday cooking because the BF said so?   Am I AITA?  


Edited to add:  I'm an independent contractor, I don't get paid holidays.  I would have had to take a day off without pay to cook this meal for his parents, and he knew that. Instead, I elected to work that day, and joined them for dinner. ",0
"I (26F) live in an apartment complex. All the little kids in our building are friends and they all play outside in our backyard. My 14 month old daughter likes to stand by the window and watch them. Sometimes the kids will come over and wave at her, talk to her, make silly faces etc.

Now one of the little boys who’s probably between 9-10 years old, tends to bully the other kids. He’s just one of those kids you can tell isn’t disciplined properly at home. He definitely walks all over his parents and other parents have scolded him before for his behavior towards their kid.  He hits the other kids and pushes them, even the little girls. This kid rides a dirt bike around the complex parking lot and has hit people’s cars on purpose. He behaves terribly in my opinion. He’s usually very dismissive and disrespectful to adults that try to talk nicely to him, so I’ve never said anything to the kid in fear my anger would get the best of me.

Well the other day, this theory proved true. My daughter was watching the kids playing soccer. I had the door open and she was standing behind the screen door so I could hear everything going on. The kid didn’t realize I was sitting on the recliner, watching my daughter when he approached our back door.

He came up to my daughter’s face, flipped her off with both middle fingers and said “f*ck you, baby.”

Now I’ve only been a mom for a little over a year now but something about this encounter with my daughter triggered something inside of me. I snapped at the boy saying , 

“Don’t f*cking talk to my daughter like that you little sh*t.”

Real classy, I know. I felt kind of bad about it when the little boy ran away scared and my fiancé just started cracking up on the couch. He asked me if that was really necessary since our daughter doesn’t understand anything he did/said. I said it just came out. It made me angry. Other parents might let something like that slide but not me. I will defend my child until she can defend herself. I don’t care if she didn’t understand him or not. He disrespected her and I just couldn’t let it go. 

Now in hindsight, I can’t help but feel bad for cursing at a 9/10 year old at my big age. But he is definitely already getting his cursing vocabulary from somewhere else since he started that dialogue with my toddler. He also came on to our property (back patio), unprovoked, just to be crass towards my daughter. Anyways, now I’m in a moral debate with myself over whether or not I was the asshole in that situation.",0
"So i (F21) was having dinner with my family. My sister(31) and her fiancé, my 2 brothers (28, 23) and my parents. 

Let me give a small back story before i continue. My sister has hated me all my life. I don’t know why but she does. I tried my hardest to have a relationship with her but she never cared for it. 

You’d think after we’ve all matured, she’d quit whatever it is she’s on but she’s still the same as she was when we were children. My parents never called her out on how she treated me so she just continued it. 

One of her favorite things to do is compare me at a certain age to her when she was that age. For example, “I was smarter at 14 than OP was, i even got better grades”. And that brings me to today. My sister was on her shit again and comparing me and the college courses i’m currently taking vs the ones she took. 

She took it to another level and said i wasn’t smart and she could prove i cheated 12 years through school and 2 years in college (???). She asks (this is her **exact** question) “if you’re so smart what is the noun of a pronoun with an adverb”. Everyone around the table kinda just stares like what? She asks again. I tell her there’s no answer to that as it didn’t make any sense. Her conclusion, i’m an idiot. 

So, i decided to ask her a question. I asked her to tell me how does precipitation work in the water cycle. A simple question *to me*. No answer. She gets red and says i purposely used a “big word” to confuse her and i wasn’t being fair. Here’s where i could be the ass. I mocked what she said “But i thought you were smarter than me”. My brother chimed in and said it was a fair question and she got embarrassed and walked out. 

My dad says i owe her an apology and said i should’ve been the “bigger person” as i’ve always been. I told him i’m not going to apologize and she can cry about it Aita?",0
"My friend -33F- ""Taylor"" and I -31F- were supposed to get brunch this am. It was Taylor's idea which may or may not matter. We made these plans like 1.5 weeks ago. She kept saying how excited she was to go. 

Yesterday Taylor shot me a text saying she was having stomach issues and wasn't sure if she'd be able to come today but would let me know. Said she was p miserable. Totally fine. I would rather her take care of herself and not push it than force herself to hang out. I told her just to let me know! 

About 2 hours later she texted again saying some dude she has hooked up with a few times made dinner reservations and she was gonna go. This guy led her on because he only wanted sex and she wanted a relationship and he didn't tell her until like a week ago and she was really upset. He has gone long periods of time ghosting her. So this isn't like an exciting new relationship or a partner. It's some douche she met on Tinder. 

So yeah she hasn't said shit to me this am and I'm kinda pissed she was feeling sick enough to wanna blow me off but not enough to make herself look stupid and go out with this jerk she barely knows. 

I consider myself a good communicator and wouldn't like jump down her throat but I'm pretty disappointed and hurt and feel like I have the right to say something to her. I think she owes me an apology and some kind of make up hang out. She is supposed to come over this weekend for a galendays day little thing I'm hosting and idk how comfy I am seeing her so soon if she doesn't apologize. I think this is something that can be solved and is not unforgivable just for the record. 

I could easily be overreacting and shouldn't say a thing at all and just chalk this up to the rejection being a trigger for anger. Accept people as they are. Help a gal out? <3 ",0
"I (42f) am a stepmom of two kids; Emma (16f) and Luke (15m) and a mom to my son Dex (6m). I have been in a relationship with my husband for 11 years and we have been married for 9 years. My stepkids are in our house every other week and with their mom every other week. The relationship with my stepkids is okay. Not perfect but not totally awful. They have always kept some walls up between me and them and my family and them. Polite and they'll talk friendly enough. But they don't want to be a part of family things with us either.

My mom has this cookbook that has been used by four generations of the family now. My grandma started it with her and her kids and then my mom got it and shared it with me and my siblings and now she shares it with her grandkids. Emma and Luke were offered to take part multiple times and they have always said they weren't interested. My mom was a little upset but understood that they might not be totally okay with that idea and she has left it open for them to change their minds.

Last year Dex took part in the tradition for the first time with mom and I. My stepkids did not want to join us so we didn't force it. Dex regularly now cooks recipes from it with my mom (and sometimes me too). He loves it. He wants to add another recipe when he's older, something we've all done.

The topic came up while my ILs were around and Dex was telling them all about it. He mentioned how much he loves being part of it and he loves cooking and baking. My ILs asked if Emma and Luke had ever been a part of it and we said no, they hadn't wanted to be. They asked why not and we said they didn't seem the most comfortable with fully integrating like that as to be part of something that is a family tradition on my side but it will always be open for them to change their mind. They said we should have waited for them to include Dex and how my family and I have shown we don't care if they're involved or not. I told them they might never change their minds. They said I have made it so they won't now. They know my bio kid is more wanted by my family. I said that's unfair. They have been offered the chance many times and Dex shouldn't have to miss out because his siblings say no.

They said that's my role as a mom of three instead of a mom of one. I told them I would not make my son miss out just because my stepkids said no. They said that's why I'm wrong and why I am proving to be a poor parent to the non-bio kids that I have. My husband told them to leave and said they were wrong. But they insisted it was me who was wrong here.

AITA?",0
" My husband and I began looking at getting away from the city a few years ago. We had a small checklist: husband wanted permanent running water, I wanted a house. We looked at many properties before we stumbled across this one by a fluke. It has two permanent creeks and a small house and is absolutely perfect. The property runs adjacent to a national park so it will always remain secluded. We both instantly fell in love and even though it was quite out of our budget, our parents both loved it as well and helped us purchase it. The property itself is almost 100 acres and is the very last house on the dirt road. (Also, I should mention that the seller of the property was an elderly man who only used this place as a weekender and owned his permanent home in the city)

One of the main things that drew us to this place is the permanent creeks. They are full of swimming holes and one of the best ones even had a rope tied to the tree. Real estate agents said that a few local kids had used it because previous owner was never there and didn’t mind. 

The road turns into an easement to get to the national park entrance and the creek line is the boundary of our property to the national park. The swimming hole in question is about midway between the easement and our house. Over the years, this swimming hole has become well known to the locals and there is a path that has been made to get to this swimming hole that is on our property.  

We certainly didn’t like the idea of strangers walking so near the house so Husband puts up a wire fence across the path and a no trespassing sign. Within days of putting it up, a woman walks around the fence and to our house to yell at us saying that she has been walking this path and swimming for 30 years. We politely tell her that it is private property and just because the old owners didn’t mind doesn’t mean we do as well. Less than a week after this incident, somebody posts about the fence in our local suburb Facebook group and while many people were angry, many understood as well. We’re not asking people to not swim. We don’t own the water, we’re just asking people to go to the national park side to access the swimming hole (because we DO own right up to the waters edge). However, about another week later, our sign is stolen and the wire fence is cut. We have made it very clear what our reasoning is. We purchased this property for privacy and so far, people are more invasive than if we had purchased in the city. Just today, I was out mowing (we haven’t replaced the sign or fence yet) and 3 girls come walking from this path and walk directly across the front paddock, essentially our front yard. Am I the A-hole for wanting to protect my privacy? 

Tldr; The access to a really awesome swimming hole, that has been used for generations, is on our property and we don’t want people trespassing to get to it.

Edit: I tried to sketch the layout. Sorry it’s not great

Didn’t really want to say this but I am 26F and my husband works away for 2 weeks at a time. And there is no phone reception at all. Safety is a valid concern. We haven’t sought any legal advice and I doubt we will. We’ll try a few more peaceful resolves (signs, clearing a new path on the other side and planting plants on our on path) and if nothing works then that’s it. They win. It’s not a war I’m willing to wage because I do actually want to continue living here.",0
"So I (30f) got married, yay! Honestly, it was my dream wedding, everything went off without a hitch. Except for one small thing; my niece’s (16) dress. 

It was a white, lacy knee length dress. She even wore lace elbow length gloves! Honestly, it looked just like a wedding dress. I didn’t say anything to her or her parents (by brother and SIL) in the moment, and I tried my best to ignore it. But when I got the first drafts back from our photographer, I couldn’t stand when I saw her in her white dress standing next to me. 

My husband saw how upset I was, and suggested that we pay extra to get my niece’s dress photoshopped to a light blue. We thought it through, and since we had some budget left, we went for it. 

Well, last week, we got the final photos back and they looked great! I could hardly even tell that my niece was originally wearing white, and she still looked really nice. 

I posted some of the photos on social media, and my SIL messaged me and was angry that I photoshopped my niece without checking with her (my SIL) first. She accused me of thinking my niece was ugly and of body shaming her. To be clear, I did not have her body photoshopped, only the color of her dress and gloves. 

I don’t *think* I’m in the wrong, but this situation has been stressing me out, so AITA?

Edit: small clarification: the picture I posted was a large group shot that my niece is in. I wasn’t trying to showcase the photoshop at all.",0
"My niece (28) and her boyfriend are planning a trip and want to stay in my house to save money.  The problem is they are both lazy and jobless parasites who live off her parents. They’ve stayed with other relatives and completely trashed the place. Apparently the boyfriend doesn’t shower and my relatives had to throw out bedsheets and even a couch because they couldn’t get rid of his stench.

Now back to me, aside from not wanting to throw out my stuff due to his disgusting odor, I did not want them staying at my house on principle. They are lazy people who do nothing all day and have no reason to be vacationing much less on someone else’s dime (mine).  

I told her I did not want her staying at my house. While I did not tell her my thoughts about their lifestyle, I did tell her about how my aunt had to throw away her mattress because of her boyfriend’s B.O. and that I did not want him to ruin my things with his smell. She denied it all and was offended that I would say these things about her boyfriend and we haven’t talked since. While I don’t regret it, I feel uncomfortable for not having allowed her to stay. Even though I do not approve of her lifestyle she is still family and I have been taught to always be there for family. 

AITA for refusing to let my niece and her boyfriend stay at my house while on vacation?",0
"My girlfriend and I just had our first child just under three months ago. We live with my mother who is an hour and a half away, 90 miles, from her family. She goes down to see her mother maybe two days each month and stays there and comes home to be at work.

The issue is her mother is saying she doesn't see him as much as my mother who we live with does, and is worried he won't get to know her. So she wants us to bring him an hour and a half away, drop him off with her, and pick him up four days later.

I'm telling my girlfriend no, I won't get behind this. While yes your his mother and have an equal say, I can't get behind this. If her mother lived closer, eh maybe. But over an hour away, him not even being three months old, neither of us there if something were to happen and if something does us being that far away.

So while I can see why she's upset, denying her mother the opportunity to spend time with her own grandson, I don't think think it's the responsible thing to do.

(Additional context): I don't really want to say this but I believe this plays a huge role in her mother being this worried, my girlfriends mother lost her and her other two kids a few years after they were born. So I can see how this plays into her worries... but I still can't seem to agree with our son being that far away from either of us for that extended of a time.

Edit: I posted this in IATA because her family is accusing me of trying to keep him away from them when that's not the case. In turn that's causing my SO to be very angry/upset with me because now she's starting to believe I don't care about her family or our son knowing them etc.",0
"I love my wife very much but I’m starting to see her in a different light. When we started trying for children and having difficulty we saw a specialist. There we found out that my wife’s eggs are not viable and basically don’t work. She can still physically carry a pregnancy just not with her eggs. We were devastated especially my wife. She took it hard and went to therapy and everything. I was open to whatever solution she wanted. She didn’t want adoption and made it clear she wanted a baby related to me. We decided on an egg donor. 


She wanted full control of who it was which I didn’t mind. I allowed her to spend thousands on different clinic and specialists finding the perfect egg she wanted. I just wanted to help her fulfill her dreams of becoming a mother. Finally she decided on the donor and we had the embryo and implanted and it worked. She got pregnant with our daughter on the first try. 


She didn’t want anyone to know of her fertility issues or that we were using a donor egg and I didn’t care. Whatever made her comfortable. The pregnancy went great. Fast forward three years now. Our daughter is turning three at the end of the year. My wife and I had already discussed having another baby during this time. To my surprise when I brought it up she said she was having doubts. She said our daughter “didn’t come out how she pictured”. Visually or personality wise. She doesn’t act or look like her at all. She even started crying. I was shocked. She’s a stay at home mom and seems to love our daughter. This came from nowhere. I asked her what was wrong and she said that next time she wants another egg donor. We had already planned to reuse the same donor but I really took offense to the fact that she thinks our daughter isn’t good enough. 

She got upset and said that’s not what she means, she just wants a “better” donor that fits her more than the first donor did in terms of looks and personality. I then got upset and said that if she wants two different donors and is going to treat the kids differently because of it (subconsciously or even consciously) then I’m not gonna go along with our original agreement to never tell our daughter or future children we used an egg donor. This sent her over the edge in hysterics and she hasn’t spoken to me in days. Aita?


——

So I spoke to my wife and she’s still not talking to me a lot but I recommended we go to therapy and she said no and that she’s thought about it and that she wants to use the same donor again and to just forget what she said. But I just can’t. I told her that we should wait and she got upset again. I haven’t brought up telling our daughter about it yet because I don’t want to rock the boat too much. That seems to be what’s really upsetting her.",0
"This drama has been caused by my dads wife (wife number 3) who I’ll call ‘Sue’.

Sue is an animal lover and activist which my dad loves, however she is also a blatant racist and homophobic. 0 to 100 there but unfortunately that’s how it is. If there is an ‘ist’ or ‘phobic’ she is it. Overall she is not a pleasant person but she is my dads wife and the family have had to accept her.

Recently Sue has been complaining about how I am ‘rude’ + ‘horrible’ to her and make her feel uncomfortable in her home. I find this quite funny to be honest. As I only see her about 2 or 3 times a year, I manage to fit quite a lot in!

background- my dad and Sue got married when I was 15, Sue had always hated children so I was not invited to their wedding but my two older sisters (over 21yrs) were and also her bridesmaids. 

Sue started to speak to me after I turned 19 but only to be rude

The difficult thing is Sue pretends to be nicer (civil is probably a better word) to me when my dad is around. As soon as my dad leaves the room Sue completely changes. She will ignore me, make rude remarks about what I am doing or wearing and generally be as mean and difficult as possible. She also does this with my sisters.

Recently my dad took me out for my birthday and whilst we were talking he said he had something important to discuss with me. He said that Sue had spoken to him and said that I have been extremely rude to her recently and been making her feel uncomfortable. Then he went on a 5/10 minute lecture about how I need to kind to her and he doesn’t know why I am being rude when I am normally a nice person. During those 10 minutes I just sat there trying to process what he was saying and figure out what I had done. 

Whenever Sue is unkind to me or makes it uncomfortable I will not retaliate or be rude as it will not help the situation. I tend to excuse myself to go to the bathroom for 5 minutes so I can sit quietly and think. Recently it has been building up as my sisters don’t stick around much anymore And I have been taking most of her bullying, I’ll just sit and have a cry for 2 minutes to try and process feelings

Back to my birthday,after my character assassination my dad left for a bit. When he returned I had time to think about what he had said and the situation. So I decided to tell him my side of the story and what Sue is like when he is not around. Then he got annoyed at me for not accepting what he had said and for not apologising for how horrible I have been. That he wished I had just kept it to myself. 

Stating that sharing my opinions with him isn’t solving anything and just causing more issues for him. That he was going to support Sue and her feelings and that by telling him how i felt was ruining his hope for a happy family.

Baring in mind one of my sisters doesn’t talk to him at all anymore. And neither of my sisters have ever liked or got on with Sue. So I am not sure how I am the only person who is causing a problem.

So AITA for telling my dad my side of the story?",0
"I (19F) live in a university dorm with a roommate (18F). This semester we haven’t really fought but she’s been continuously frustrating. On multiple occasions she has forgotten her room key and asked me to let her in. This wouldn’t be an issue if it wasn’t such a common occurrence for her to expect me to run across campus for her or let her in at early hours (all while being very unappreciative of whenever I let her in). She could easily go to the residence help desk and get a spare key as it is less than a block away and open 24/7 but always chooses not to. She has also on multiple occasions given me no warning before replacing her key and in the process demagnetising mine. This is slightly annoying because when I get back from a three hour lab I would like to be able to fix my key before I get to my room and realise I can’t open the door. Over reading week she also called me numerous times asking me to search for her wallet and key in the room, even though I had told her and texted her that night that I was at home (hours away from the university). In addition to all of this, it is clear that she hates living on residence and as such is overall just negative to be around.

Now this is the part where I might be the AH. The other night I fell asleep at 2 am after studying for finals. She came home at 5 am and turned on all the lights - this woke me up, but only enough to make my eyes open and look around before I fell back asleep as she left the room. As far as my roommate knew, I was asleep the whole time. A few minutes later, she tried to call me and my phone rang. I looked at my phone and when I saw it was her, I muted it, figuring she was trying to get me to let her back into our room. She tried calling me again and made my phone vibrate and fall onto the floor from my lofted bed. I later found out she tried to call me 4 times. Eventually she started continuously knocking loudly on the door. I still didn’t get out of bed. After five minutes she started calling my name and it almost sounded like she was crying in the hall. It is exam season, so quiet hours were in effect especially strictly. Eventually someone else let her in, probably the RA (resident assistant) on duty or our RA down the hall. When she came back into the room I pretended to be asleep so she wouldn’t know I was ignoring her the whole time.

So Reddit, AITA?",0
"I(28F) have twin 5 year old boys Jude and Jonah. They go to a private Jewish kindergarten where it’s very customary to invite the whole class to birthday parties, it might even be a school rule but I don’t think I’m going to take this to the school.

Jude and Jonah are very well mannered and reserved, obviously I’m biased but they’ve always gotten along with all of their peers and have never gotten into any drama. Jude is definitely a slow reader and we’ve gotten him a tutor but it’s still been very hard for him.

At our synagogue the bathroom signs just say men and women with no little picture and they are single bathrooms. 2 weekends ago Jude walked into the women’s by accident and I guess the door wasn’t locked correctly because he walked in on this women named Jess who is the mother of a little girl in his class. He says he just saw her on the toilet and ran out, closed the door and said sorry. 

Jude immediately came up to me and told me and he was very embarrassed. I told him it wasn’t a big deal and he should just remember to knock next time and the longer word says women. He said he will and that he thought it would be a stalled bathroom like most public bathrooms and that’s fair so I left it there.

Jess came up to talk to me after and told me like he needed to be punished, she said it was extremely inappropriate. I assured her he didn’t know and wouldn’t do it again but she said there’s “no way he can’t read men and women” and that her daughter can and told me I had to nip this behavior in the bud. I often feel talked down to because of my age by other parents at the school so I just said I would take care of it and left it there.

On Friday her daughter was handing out birthday invites and gave one to Jonah, not Jude. They both asked her why and she said her mom said not to give him one and wouldn’t tell her why. Jude cried the whole rest of the day and wouldn’t tell anyone why because he doesn’t want to be a tattle tale. I asked Jude if anything else had happened between the 2 of them and he promised me it didn’t and said they’ve even been playing together at recess this whole last week. And her daughter was trying to cheer him up by suggesting ways to sneak him in.

I’m honestly livid, I wouldn’t care if she had given neither of them an invite but giving one twin and not the other is incredibly rude and passive aggressive. I’m considering calling her and talking about it because I think it’s ridiculous to hold this much of a grudge against a 5 year old. Would that make me an AH? Should I just decline Jonahs invite? I think the birthday rule is silly and it’s her choice who she invites but this is just ridiculous.

Edit: Synagogue and School are 2 separate places, but there’s a lot of overlap with the people. Also, I’m not planning on sending either of them to the party at the moment, but I’m considering calling her to confront her about it rather than just having this weird dynamic where I’m hearing things from Jude that come from her kid that come from her.",0
"I am a 29F and I am married to my husband of 6 years Jon 34M.  We have 2 kids ""Samantha"" 4F and ""Jacob"" 2M.  We are both working professionals and so we have pretty busy schedules but try pretty hard to make time for extended family.  Well, a few months ago my parents asked my brother and his wife and myself and my husband to get together for family photos.  We were happy to do it as an early Mothers' Day/Fathers' Day gift and took the photos about 3 weeks ago.  My mom had organized the whole event and gave the photographer a list of groupings that she wanted. She included photos of the whole family, all the grandkids together, each individual family, my parents with my brother and me, myself and my husband together, grandkids with grandparents, etc.  It was a long day for the kids but it made my parents really happy so we were happy to do it.

The issue comes up when my MIL saw the photos posted by my mom last week.  She told my husband that she would also like to set up a photographer for her to have photos done with the grandkids (we have their only two).  My husband said he would check with me and get back to her but she said no need since she only required the kids and my husband for the shoot.  He thought it was strange and told her he would get back to her.

When he told me he asked me my opinion I said it was strange that she didn't need me there for family photos.  I asked him for more clarification and when we called her on Facetime, she informed me that she plans to do a family shoot for just her family. I let her know that my husband could do whatever he wanted but our children would be sitting out a family shoot that did not include their mother.

My husband said if she really wanted photos with him and his siblings (he is the only one that is married), he would do it but that our children were our family and that they would not be included.  My MIL and family are blaming me and she is arguing that she deserves photos with the grandkids like my parents have and I already have my family photos from the shoot with my parents.  I think she ruined it when she didn't want to include me from the beginning and is doubling down on her reasoning by saying ""I got my family photos already.""  

I may be TA because I could just let my kids go with their dad but I don't think I'm TA because it's weird for my kids to do family photos without their mom.",0
"I 22f let my roommate  22f know I'm not renewing the lease in August. I let her know it's because of her disrespecting my boundaries. It's very frequent as well, I just don't feel like she respects me. And when I do try to communicate when or why I'm upset she will be mad at me for about a week and won't talk about it. She recently ignored my boundaries again this weekend.  And I've had enough of it. One of our doorm mates had moved out the year before because of the same problem. She's moving out all her stuff now and living with her parents. I'm extremely anxious about my decision.  I'm having trouble eating and always feeling like I'm about to puke. I feel like if I made the right decision I wouldn't feel like this right? I want to just say hey nvm, but she didn't even apologize to me. I'm a really considerate roommate, I just felt like I want being treated like a person. And I didn’t like living with her. But I feel like I could put up with it. I'm by myself where I live now and only have myself to rely on. I'm tied down to my area by my work and college are here.

Edit: I wanted to thank everyone that commented. Everyone has made very valid points. And I'm feeling alot better. Having my feelings validate has taken alot of the stress and anxiety off my shoulders. I was able to walk in to my apartment feeling okay. I really appreciate it guys thank you so much. 💚",0
"I(15m) am struggling with anxiety, I recently had cried/coughed so hard that I threw up blood last Thursday and had internal bleeding, I got to the hospital and got taken care of. 

But now my dietary options are pretty limited, I’m only allowed to eat easily digestible food due to my condition. So I’m pretty much out of energy 24/7, I honestly didn’t have the motivation to eat before and now this just made it worse.

I also want to say I’m trying to avoid my family as much as possible, due to past issues. 

So after 2 days, I finished my PPI injections iirc, and decided to call my friends to tell them about what happened. They decided to visit me on sunday, and I was glad to hear that.

They came, and didn’t stay long because they had to go back home and study. But they bought me expensive chocolate that you don’t eat on everyday.

I was worried that they bought this expensive chocolate for nothing, but I texted my doctor and he told me it will be okay to eat it after 1 week.

My sister(18m), saw the chocolate and said what a shame I can’t eat them, I informed her that actually I will be able to eat them in one week, she didn’t look thrilled.

Next day, I opened the freezer and saw she opened one of the chocolate and took a bar for herself. I texted her and she said it was only a bar and that I’m selfish for keeping it for myself.

I thought I shouldn’t stress over this, but then at midnight I saw her take another bar again without my permission, infront of me. I told her multiple times to stop and she kept on calling me selfish over and over again. 

So I blocked the entrance to her room and told her to give it back. She then acted in shock, and I said “What did you think was gonna happen when you took it without permission?” And then she spit the chocolate in her mouth into the ground and threw the entire bar too. Then she called me selfish and other names, then slammed her door. I didn’t respond and just went to pick up what was left of my chocolate bar.

Now I don’t know what you’ll think, but if I took her friend’s gift after she recently threw up blood, I bet she will react even worse. Honestly I’m so fucking stressed now and I cried the night after.


Update: Sister apologized to me and bought 2 packets of the chocolate she ate ",0
"So, I feel like this may sound weird, so I’m gonna give some context.


I’m currently living with my mom in my mom’s boyfriend’s house. I’m not old enough to move out, however I am old enough to have a job. This job only allows me to have two uniforms, but has me work 5 days each week, all back to back, all night shift, all 6+ hours each. 

Today, because it’s MLK JR day, and because it’s my one of two days off, I went to wash clothes because 
A. I still had stuff from last week
B. I still had some hoodies that needed to be washed for this week
C. Ny work uniforms basically smelled like they had been fished out of a dumpster

I get out of my room, basket in hand, and see my mom’s boyfriend on the couch. He immediately stops me, says I just washed cloths Friday, and that I needed to not wash cloths, and that he would be talking to my mom. I went back into my room, put my cloths back into the closet, and forgot about it.

Now, this wouldn’t bother me so much, but it’s the fact that (just bear with me) they’re planning a Disney trip for this week. How can they not afford things like the water bill, but can afford things like almost BACK TO BACK Disney world trips? 

Am I the asshole in this situation? I’m not even being allowed to wash my cloths too :(

Edit: made some typos; should be all good now ^-^",0
"So the argument has started because my headphones have broken that I use daily for my university work and had to use my remaining money (30£) to get myself some cheap ones that will get me through the remaining months as I really need them for lectures. 

I asked to borrow £40 until the end of the month as I’m really struggling to afford food. That’s when it started. I’m a student on minimal maintenance loan with a part time job just to get by that recives no financial help from either of my parents. I never ask them for money unless I’m desperate, and when I do I always ask if they can lend me some and not give. 

The argument started because I explained the situation and been told maybe because she’s working her ass off to afford £5k holiday and essentially it’s not her problem. She started taking jabs at me for my poor mental health, my friends and told me she can’t stand me “whining” all the time. Went as far as to tell me that she didn’t force me to seek further education and I created my own problem. 

I got heated and said some rough stuff back such as she only cares about herself and never once did she give a crap about me. My parents never been there for me financially, ever since I was young. No emotional support either, never attended parents meetings, don’t visit me at university, don’t really celebrate holidays or special days together. 

When my parents have been going through divorce, I was always there for her doing my best to make sure she was okay on top of everything else I had going on, but when I’m going through things it always causes an argument and I’m told that “I’m ungrateful” and constantly “whining”. 

She sent me the money and I thanked her letting her know I’ll pay her back once I get paid. Left me on read.

"I am a housewife now, I was a stay at home mom when my kids were young and now that everyone is out of the home I am a housewife. The moment I met Beth, she has had a problem with me.

The first time I met her and I told her I am a homemaker, she told me that’s not a job and it’s lazy of me. I met her 30 minutes before that. 

It comes up all the damn time, they come over for dinner and I mention I am tired and she will tell me I don’t work so how am I tired. I have talked to her and my son before. My husband and I have concluded that she is jealous. It’s the only thing that makes sense at this point.

I have told her if it happens again I will ask her to leave and the comments stopped for a bit. They were over for a dinner party and I was talking about how I made the pie for tonight.  Beth made a comment that of course I had enough time since I don’t work.

I had enough and told her I had enough. I get that her is jealous of me since she has to work but she needs to get out and she is not welcome back. My son and her called me a jerk for kicking them out.

Edit: Not working doesn’t equal lazy. I am not loafing around the house all day. I get up do all the chores, take care of all the paperwork, go for gym, take the dogs out, make homemade meals everyday, volunteer and so on.

Lazy would be chilling in front of the tv all day. Not having the home spotless and having my husband have no worries about anything that isn’t work related",0
"I'm a stay at home mom with a 1 year old and my husband sometimes likes to come home for lunch. It's a hassle because at the time he has his lunch it is also our babies nap time, so you can imagine how annoying it can be when she's about to fall asleep but up she bounces when her dad comes through the door. It's even harder to put her down after he leaves because now she's grumpy and tired. Also he has an hour of lunch so it's 20 min to get home, 20 min to eat, then 20 min to drive back. He'll leave a mess taking out his lunch and dirtying the dishes and then it's up to me to clean up after him and sweep up the dirt from him boots. Which is even more annoying when I already finished cleaning that half of the house and now I have to do it again. I finally had it today when I had to mop the floor again in the kitchen after I told him it was wet and he got his muddy boots on it, he asked me why I was annoyed and I told him ""Why do you think I always pack a lunch for you? So you can have lunch at WORK"" He seemed hurt by this and just threw the rest of his food away, again caking mud on the floor I just mopped, and left. Ive cooled down since then and now I just feel like an asshole. So am I the asshole for feeling this way? Or am I the asshole for the way I chose to say my words?


Edit: Me and my husband talked it out where I explained why I lashed out and apologized and also came to a compromise where on the days I ""Deep Clean"" he would instead stay at work and enjoy his 1 hour break. I only deep clean 2 days of the week so he still has 4 of those days to enjoy lunch with us. Although he also enjoys staying at work and watching his favorite shows on his phone while he eats. Again I enjoy having my husband for 20 min during lunch but on that 1 day I really need the baby to nap because it makes my day so much easier

Edit: Guys he doesn't work 6 days a week he works a regular 40 hours.45 including his breaks",0
"Edit: thanks for the support everyone, I just wanted to give a nice gift and now I feel better about that. Also, my partner is non binary and uses they/them pronouns for anyone mentioning them in the comments tyvm :)

I (25f) bought my partner (21nb) a “just because” gift which was a couple bottles of Prime, some Feastables, and a V-Bucks gift card. I was telling my friend about this and they called me disgusting and said that I was “minor coding” my partner by buying them things for “a 13 year old boy”

I was really just trying to do something nice because my partner has mentioned liking these things in the past but now idk. Is “minor coding” like this a thing?

I am so confused and would like to hear some other opinions",0
"I am currently in professional school (Doctorate Degree), my program was difficult and my graduation was delayed, I decided to add a masters to my original program and pursue a dual degree. In my masters program, I was taking a class that was a little challenging so I then asked my friend who her previous professor was when she took the class. I also in my defensive did not ask this out of the blue, as she first asked me to take her birthday pictures 2 days earlier meanwhile we hadn’t really talked in over a month, I also said yes with no hesitation.

Two days after I asked her about the masters class she sent me a nasty text message saying she wanted to voice concerns about our friendship and stated she felt it was strange that I asked about her experience with the class in the masters program meanwhile I was secretive about applying for the program and did not let her know. She stated she felt I was dishonest and what type of friendship are we building because she is rooting for me and she felt my actions are “giving competition”. 
(I actually told her I applied & she later called to apologize & admitted she forgot that I told her.. this was after she raised her voice on the phone with me times and stated she’s standing strong on her word and won’t apologize) I stated I basically failed classes in my program and I didn’t think getting a masters was something to celebrate nor is it any of her business. After telling her this, she was still originally rude to me otp before later apologizing. She is also mad that I told my other friend who is in a similar program about my challenges and not her. She also kind of has a big mouth and tells people’s business a lot, which is part of why I didn’t tell her in the first place. She also threw my other friend under the bus and told me that she knew I told him about the masters and not her (even though I did tell her too)

At first I brushed it off and didn’t think much of it. Now I am annoyed that she came to confront me. I also don’t want to take her birthday pics. She has a weekend long birthday celebration coming up soon and I really don’t want to go. This celebration is out of town and 2 hours away. I feel that given the circumstances and me wanting to focus on school, it is a lot for me to drive out of town to celebrate her birthday with her and 10+ other people. My sibling said if I don’t show up then I’m TA and this is exactly what my friend was referring to regarding where our friendship lies. AITA for not telling her specifics about my program and for not wanting to go to her birthday?

I may be at fault for not being fully open about my academic struggles and decisions with her might be seen as lacking transparency in our friendship. I also may be TA because I don't want to attend the party anymore.",0
"My sister has two kids, John 15 and Annie 16. 

They’re complete opposites. John’s more… generic? Pretty much what you think of when you think 15yo boy that does sports. Annie’s more on the “doesn’t fit in” side or at least that’s what she thinks.

Anyways, my sister called me last night and asked if I could take John for a couple nights. I said of course and asked why and she told me that Annie crossed a line.

Now, John’s report card from last year wasn’t very good. He was pretty embarrassed by it but there was an underlying reason. He goes into these depression slumps often and yeah, my sister and her husband are talking to professionals but it’s taking a very long time to get somewhere. Annie is aware of this and hasn’t really expressed any concern but we figured she just doesn’t get the seriousness of it. 

Well, apparently she took pictures of John’s report card and posted it on her snap story. Most ppl didn’t care but a select few (Annie’s best friends) tried to make it this big thing. John and Annie have each other blocked but John’s friends texted him about it and John got really upset. They had a massive fight and Annie said some horrible things about how he’s just an idiot that’s faking his slumps. She said things like “I’m the one that mom and dad should care about, not your privileged ass.” 

It was overall a very bad fight and my sister wants to get to the bottom of Annie’s comments but she also doesn’t want to subject John to Annie any longer. So I went to pick John up and while I was talking to my sister about the next few nights, Annie came out of her bedroom yelling at me and asking me if I’m taking John’s side too. I didn’t say anything which upset her even more and she said “I need someone on my side too, you’re all taking his side because he’s pretending to have depression and I assumed you would be smarter about this considering how intelligent you are but you’re also just another victim of misogyny.” 

My sister seemed to be at a loss for words and I just went “Do you even know what you’re talking about?” 

This struck a nerve in Annie and she was like “of course I fucking do, I’m a woman. I’ve been dealing with misogyny all my life and you questioning me like this just proves that you’re just like all the other women in this goddamn country. You’re a woman, how dare you question my experience…” or whatever else she said. She was using big words throughout and honestly she does have a point but it doesn’t apply in this situation in my opinion.

Either way, she actually made a tiktok about how her family is misogynistic etc and used my “do you even know what you’re talking about” thing as her main example and though this account is PRIVATE, she has a couple hundred followers that seem horrified by what I said. I know this because Annie has been sending me screenshots of these comments. AITA?

Edit:

Just wanted to clarify that niece is not and was not being neglected because of John. My sister doesn’t favor John, and no one expects my niece to drop everything for her brother. I don’t think people understand but John did need extra attention for a while because his mental state was so unstable and he was in hospital. But Annie was never neglected. After he got out of the danger zone, a parent was always at home. They even had multiple heart to hearts with Annie about how she felt etc. No one’s perfect and I’m not saying we didn’t make mistakes, but my sister’s doing her best for both of her kids during this very difficult time. Please don’t make assumptions about how bad of a mother my sister is because she isn’t a bad mom.

INFO: 
Some people are confused about the hospital stay. My nephew didn’t eat for a couple days which ultimately led to hospitalization and us finding out that he has a mental illness. My niece was left “alone” for a week which was the “danger zone” I’m referring to. I stayed with her for most of this week. She is completely capable of being alone and has basic life skills but I was there because of what the situation was like. Nephew came home some time later and they are currently looking for professionals to help further his treatment. I hope that explains some things. I had no idea this post would reach so many people so I just wrote this post off handedly without putting too much thought into it. My apologies. 

Edit 2:

Thought this was a given, but don’t use this post as an excuse to shit on feminism and women’s rights. I actually do agree with my niece about various things (which is why she called me intelligent and was so shocked I wasn’t “on her side”). I would call myself a feminist and I think that young women, especially girls my niece’s age aren’t taken seriously because of their age which is wrong. I don’t like it and I think every girl regardless of well anything needs to heard. I was simply wondering if what I said was harmful.

Two things can exist at once. My niece isn’t applying the feminist idea in the right way but she isn’t wrong about feminism in general.",0
"I, 32F, booked a celebratory dinner for myself to mark my getting through a very challenging probation period at my new job. I got accepted yesterday and I invited my family (mom, dad, brothers, husband) out for dinner today. 

I chose today, Thursday, because where I'm from (Kuwait) it's the end of the week. Friday evenings my dad has a weekly social obligation that he never misses, and Saturday my mom has an important Zoom call conference. I don't want to wait until sometime next week to celebrate because I feel that (1) the excitement of the achievement will have worn off and (2) my husband works most evenings, and if I wanted him to join he'd only be able to make Monday or Thursday. 

Now, here's the issue. My husband (37M) is upset that I chose today, Thursday at 6pm, because this conflicts with his self appointed exercise time. Which I generally respect, but imagine that I'm not wrong to request a deviation from his regular programming in order to celebrate a special occasion. 

If you're wondering, he's in excellent shape, and it's not like I'm sabotaging his weightloss goals by inviting him to this dinner. This is purely about him feeling like I'm infringing on his ""me"" or ""self-care"" time. 

He's said he won't go if I don't reschedule for a later time. My family doesn't want to eat at a later time, and neither do I, to be frank. Everyone else has confirmed that they'll be there at 6pm.

AITA?

Edit to add: 6pm is the only reasonable available slot today at the restaurant that I've been pestering him to take me to for months. The next available slot is at 10pm, which is most of our bed times.",0
"I'm in the netball academy at my high school and there's this one girl, who we'll call Nancy, who likes to be the boss of everyone she can. 

Nancy is a very confident and well-known girl and she's a good netball player but she's far too bossy for most people to handle. Today we were playing a game of netball and she umpired for the first quarter since we only had time for two quarters. During the time she was umpiring, she called everyone for things that didn't happen and it was making some people annoyed so me and my friends (who we'll call Kayla and Alyssa) decided to umpire after asking the teacher if we could. Nancy then played in Center for a bit and when Kayla called her for obstruction and offside, Nancy wasn't happy and mumbled something under her breath but Kayla and I both knew what she said and it wasn't nice at all. I then had to play the opposing Center position to Nancy and she gave me dirty looks, thinking she was better than I was at netball. I'm not one to judge a person's skills at sports but she was judging mine. Nancy and I both play netball outside of school but for different teams. We're both in the same age division but not the same skill division since Nancy is in div 3 (the lowest division) and i'm in div 2 (the middle division). There are only 3 divisions for skill in our age group but she doesn't know that i'm in the skill division above her. So, AITA?",0
"First of all, I am a huge pet lover. I've had both cats and dogs. Ive been seeing this man for 7 months and everything has been absolutely perfect... except his dog. He has huge separation anxiety and gets jealous. Whenever my boyfriend touches me, the dog begins to bark and scratch us until he gets used to it. He cannot be left alone for 2 minutes, he has to constantly be next to us. Whenever we go inside the bedroom, he has to follow us. Every time we go back home, he is waiting for us by the window. He cries for what seems like a lifetime if my boyfriend has to leave the house for some reason. When my boyfriend comes to pick me up or take me back home, he brings his dog sometimes. I feel like I'm going crazy and like I can't escape this dog. 

Today, I told my boyfriend my concerns respectfully and that he has to train him to be less jealous and more independent, otherwise I would lose my mind. I know dogs are supposed to be social so I'm afraid I'm over reacting.",0
"I (26F) live with two roommates, Adam (28M) and Zeke (30M).

For context: I've been in this house the longest; Adam moved in a year and a half ago and Zeke moved in about a month and a half ago.

Adam has a new job and recently enrolled in school again, and also takes care of a relative and does occasional housesitting/petsitting. He is very much a social butterfly with lots of spontaneous commitments and connections; he loves networking and meeting new friends in unlikely places around town. Zeke works from home and does not have a car, so he'll go out with friends sometimes but usually (as far as I can tell) he mostly just tags along with my weekly grocery shopping or gets an Uber to work events. I work outside the house; I'm fairly introverted and don't usually like to go out without advance warning, and I have a tiny tiny social battery.

To the point. When Zeke moved in, he mentioned a local restaurant that was good, and I said I'd never been; he suggested we go there sometime. I said I thought that would be fun. A couple weeks later, he asked me if the next Saturday would work for us to do that; I said yes because it was several days in advance. Adam wasn't home at the time; this was late afternoon and he doesn't usually get done with work for another hour or two.

Zeke and I didn't talk about it again for a few days. In the meantime, Adam let us know that he was housesitting elsewhere from that Friday through the following Wednesday. When he has these gigs he usually will pop in and out to get things and feed his cat, but it's not on any regular schedule and there's usually no warning before he walks in.

So, on Saturday Zeke and I went to the restaurant; Adam was not home when we left. We decided to combine that trip with a stop at his parents' house to drop off some stuff that was taking up too much space. Zeke suggested in the car that we also look at a game shop down the street from the restaurant, which I agreed to. We came back about two hours later and went our separate ways for the evening.

I spent Sunday and half of Monday at my parents' place. When I got back on Monday afternoon, Zeke said Adam had been there the night before and was upset that he hadn't been included in the plans; apparently I ""should have known"" that he was free. It's true that I don't know of any specific standing commitments Adam has on Saturday afternoons; however, I also expected he would be staying elsewhere that day. Most importantly, I don't believe I'm obligated to invite him along. This was a plan I made with one specific person. We didn't intentionally exclude Adam, it just never came up, and then he wasn't around.

If it changes anything, I've gone out with Adam and our former roommate a handful of times, and with Adam one-on-one a couple times too. Zeke and Adam have gone out once or twice too. They invited me along but I declined.

I can understand feeling some FOMO, but am I actually TA for not inviting Adam?",0
"My (22F) mom (mid 40' F) is one of those people who is always late to everything. I'm talking family gettogethers, birthdays, graduations, wedding's, you name it she's showing up late. At first growing up I just thought it was because she's bad with time, but as I've gotten older I genuinely believe she likes making an entrance.

I personally find it 1) rude and 2) embarrassing because it's not like it happens once in a while, it literally happens at every single function she is invited to that has a set time. Many family members have complained about this, nothing ever changes. It's gotten to the point that whenever my grandma has family lunches or dinners she'll tell me mom it starts an hour earlier that it actually does, so she'll be there on time. (My mom doesn't know that my grandma does this, it's a joke between grandma and I).

This past weekend was my 22nd birthday. My grandma wanted to do a lunch for me at her place with our immediate family. The lunch was to start at 2pm, but we told my mom 1pm. 

I had plans later that evening to go out for dinner with my boyfriend, so I wanted to leave my grandma's house at around 5 the absolute latest because I needed to go home and get all ready. 

Well of course my mom was late. We called her at like 2:30PM to see where she was because you know, it's her daughters birthday. She had just left her house at 2:30PM and still had to pick up her bf on her way to my grandma's (30-35 mins away) so none of us were expecting her to arrive until like 3:30PM. 

She finally arrives 2 and a half hours late from the time we told her, makes her little entrance. We question her about. She tells us she thought the lunch started at 2? We asked her where she heard this from, she said my aunt (who was present at the lunch) told her.

We questioned my aunt and she said she felt bad ""lying to my mom"".

Everyone is pretty annoyed, but we all move on. Fast forward an hour later (4:30PM) I have to start leaving.

My mom starts getting all annoyed with me that I'm leaving ""so soon"" and that she barely got to see me for my birthday. I told her that my life doesn't revolve around her, and that she should've been there sooner.

She started giving me attitude and listing all these excuses as to why she's late. I couldn't be bothered to hear them and left. 

Later that night she messaged me saying that I was acting like an AH towards her and it was rude of me to lie to her about the time the lunch started. My mom and my aunt think I'm an AH for lying to her. My grandma doesn't think it's a big deal and they're overacting. I came here for some outside opinions.",0
"In 2019, my (40M) son (18M) went on a trip with some friends, one of the kid's parents owned a large cabin and all of them went there for the weekend (all boys, about 10 in total). my son was out to his friends at the time and came out to me a few months later.

yesterday one of the boys from that trip, (i'll call them F) made a post on their story, it was a video of him and my son kissing and making out. with the caption 'hey, remember this?'. apparently on the trip a game of truth and dare got a little intense, and this friend was dared to kiss my son.

normally what the boys post on their social media stays between them but one of the parents saw the vid, recorded it and started sending it to all the parents. and it eventually made its way to me and F's mom, she freaked out. she immediately called me and asked to speak 'parent to parent'.

F is bi and after he came out she basically begged him to not tell anyone (his friends already knew) and after seeing the video, she is convinced that my son 'made him gay'. she wanted to know what I was going to do about it. I was genuinely confused and asked her what she meant, she asked how me and my son intend to help 'fix' F.

I called her crazy, and told her there was nothing to 'fix', I then told her if she didn't love F for who he is, I would always make a space for him at my house (he's a close friend of my son and is around often). she then started screaming at me, accusing me of trying to kidnap F and 'make him fully gay, while he is still fixable'. she has now been telling people that I verbally abused her, called her crazy and insane, and threatened to come and take F away.

I've had a lot of people, mostly parents, telling me that I'm TA for how I treated her and that I shouldn't interfere with things that don't involve me. now I know 100% that she is TA for the things she said about my son and F, but I'm starting to think I might also be TA for the way I handled it, I probably shouldn't have yelled and may have just made it worse for F. so AITA?

EDIT: spelling

EDIT 2: I took your guy’s advice and told F, directly that he was welcome to stay with me. It turns out that he hasn’t been home since the video started going round the parents. So he is currently in my living room watching a movie with me and my son. F is 18 (legal adult) and is going to be staying with us.


Also I guess I should stop calling him F and start calling him BF, because apparently the vid from two years ago isn’t the only time they’ve kissed. We are gonna try and get some of his stuff tomorrow, if not, we’ll go out and buy him clothes and stuff.

Thanks you all so much, if it wasn’t for you I wouldn’t have realised how much trouble F was actually in and might have not contacted him.",0
"My boyfriend and I are both 18, and 35w pregnant with our daughter. Since the day I found out we were having a girl he was hell bent on naming her Renesmae, absolutely refuses to compromise. He's a massive twilight fan, I personally hate it and would much rather that we don't name our baby after a fictional character. 

It kinda hit boiling point last night, for weeks I've been telling him we are coming up with something else becaudr I'm not naming my child that. I went onto Instagram where he had posted a picture of us and said in the caption ""I can't wait to meet you Renesmae.""

I got really really mad my this. I told him to delete that, or change the caption because I'm not naming our daughter that. He refused, saying his friends knew now so we had to stick with it. I said ""I haven't fucking agreed to naming our daughter after some stupid made up character from the worst books ever fucking made. Delete the post now or get the fuck out of my house"". 

He left to spend the night at a friends and my parents who heard the argument said I should just let him name our daughter that, saying it probably means a lot to him and that I'm being an unreasonable asshole. AITA?

Edit: Feel the need to add, I have a stutter and can't even say Renesmae out loud, I would much rather name my child something I can say.

Stop trying to adopt my child. She is very much loved and wanted.",0
"This is really hard for me to share. I have purging disorder. It's like bulimia but no binge. I'm 25 and started getting help which was hard because everyone associates throwing up with bulimia (or worse ""bulemia"" and ""bullemia"") and gets dismissive. 

I've been purge free for the first time since I was 10. I hadn't been to a dentist since I was 12. Well obviously, my teeth are fucked. Now when I made the appointment I was clear that it's been a long time since I'd been to a dentist and have an eating disorder, and asked if I could schedule with a kind dentist because it was already scary for me. They said of course, they understand.

When I had the appointment...that's not what happened. The person who started the cleaning and exam was very rough and as soon as she got into it she made this long deep sigh and said ""Let me guess, you're bulimic?""

I started to say ""No, I have purging disorder"" and she cut me off as soon as I said no and said something like ""Please don't lie to me. It's not going to help you or me. We're going to have to (bunch of stuff I don't remember/understand.""

I said ""No, you don't understand. I don't have bulimia, I have--"" she cut me off and said ""It doesn't matter. You have severe enamel erosion, several of your teeth have X and Y.""

I said ""IT'S PURGING DISORDER"" because I thought if I said ""no"" again she would catapult me. 

She said ""Okay, sure, ""purging disorder"""" with air quotes and rolled her eyes.

I'm not proud of it but I started to cry because it was already so anxiety-inducing for me. She got annoyed and took off her gloves, threw them away, and said she would be back when I calmed down. Instead of calming down, I just got my things and left without paying anything. I cried in my car but shook it off and ended up going home. 

When I got home I was still really upset and so I started writing reviews left and right about the situation. I think I left one on like 7 sites. About two weeks later, I got a call. It was someone from that dental practice who had matched my name with my appointment and was wanted to discuss my reviews and how I was obviously very upset, but was leaving those reviews really necessary.

I said yes, it was, to prevent anyone else from having the same humiliating experience. She argued with me that it wasn't going to change anything or fix my teeth. I lied and said that I had already seen another dentist who had managed to treat me with dignity and respect and hung up. On the sites you can reply to reviews, someone responded to me and tried to pretend they worked with me to figure it out.

I've talked about this in my therapy group and with friends. A bunch of people are telling me I'm wrong because 1-star reviews can really hurt small businesses and how it's not their fault they aren't trained better, but I shouldn't take it out on them. I don't know. I think people need to know. AITA? Is it really that bad?",0
"I'm (17F) a senior in HS and making my college decision soon. I got into some really great schools for my major and I'm really excited for college.

My parents divorced when I was 7, and I was living with my mom until she died when I was 14. I have only been living with my dad and his wife for the past 3 years. My dad remarried ""Lisa"" when I was 9 and she has a daughter (Jan, 17F) my age.

My mom's family has been saving for me to go to college. My maternal grandparents have a 529 for me that they and my mom had been contributing to since I was a baby; it has >110k right now.

Jan has really bad social anxiety and kinda clung to me when I started living with my dad. I guess bc Jan didn't really have many friends before I came along, Lisa has taken to pushing me to spend a lot of my time with her. This has only worsened during the pandemic + the fact that I don't really see her as a sister or friend, more like a housemate (we didn't interact much when I was living with my mom bc my dad would always take me out when I visited him).

College decisions and financial aid have all come in, and I got into my first choice school with enough aid that I can graduate debt-free with my mom's family's support. I absolutely love this school and its culture and I really clicked with it when I visited. Jan, however, only feels comfortable going to the state school (which is great for her major) that I also got into. Since finding out that I also got into State, Jan and Lisa have started talking about the future as if we're going to go to school together and live together at school. When I told them that I got into and plan on going to FC, they exploded. Lisa said that I was abandoning Jan, and Jan has started crying a lot about not knowing anyone in college. Lisa said that if I didn't go to State with Jan, she and my dad would cut off financial support for college. I told her that my grandparents are paying. I got angry and said that if she cuts me off, I can write a kickass essay about her cutting me off for more outside scholarships. Last weekend, I went over to my grandparents' house, told them about getting into FC, accepted the admission, and we ate ice cream. I went home and told my dad's family over dinner and now Lisa has become extremely passive aggressive about me ""not supporting family"" and Jan just cries and pleads me to change my mind. My dad says that I should take back my commitment (and lose $750) and commit to State to keep the peace at home.

I might be TA because I know Jan will have a hard time adjusting to college without any familiarity and that me being there would help her, but I flat out refused without really talking to them about it. I also don't want to be around Jan forever.

EDIT: Wow. I honestly didn't expect this to blow up so much! I'm sorry that I haven't been able to reply to many people, but I'm definitely reading through all the comments; thank you so much for your support! I've been talking to my school and grandparents this week and we'll hopefully figure something out. So far, I've been able to mostly avoid Dad, Lisa, and Jan by staying in my room. I will definitely be sitting down and talking with them this weekend after I gather my thoughts and am able to go into the conversation with a clear agenda.

Also, thank you so much for the awards! I don't really know what they mean, but I'm honored!",0
"I have a babysitter who watches my two young girls while me and my husband go to work. She brings her daughter with her. She’s always been great. One day, she was about 10 minutes late which made me late for work. It’s fine because it hasn’t happened before, and she apologized and I thought we were all good. 

A day later, she lets me know that she had been helping my daughter on her iPad and some texts popped up between me and my husband. I was complaining to him that the babysitter was late that morning and it made me late to work. Well, she kept reading and read all our texts for the past month. I had also complained to him once that our babysitter had eaten all our Oreos. It was just funny banter, and I got over it quickly but I was still whining. I would have never said anything to her about it. 

Anyway, the babysitter texted me the night before she was supposed to watch my kids next that she was quitting because of those texts she read. She was really hurt I would complain about her to him. I feel horrible but also violated that she read all our texts. I apologized for what I said but I still feel sad about it all. AITA?",0
"My girlfriend invited me to have Thanksgiving with her family and this morning there were still a lot of last minute preparations. My girlfriend's mom gave  my girlfriend's sister ""Marge"" a list of items, including alcohol, to go get. Marge asked me to drive her to the store. I asked my girlfriend if she needed my help with anything at the house. She said ""no, go supervise Marge."" I thought nothing of her phrasing at the time, but apparently it was significant.

At the store, Marge asked me to get several items to save time, but she never actually handed me the list. She just said stuff like ""can you grab napkins?"" When we were leaving I asked if she wanted me to pay for anything, but she said no. When we got back my girlfriend and Marge got in a huge fight about Marge getting the wrong items, specifically her not getting my girlfriend's favorite wine, which was on the list, and instead getting a different wine that wasn't.

My girlfriend was also mad at me for not supervising like she told me to. She asked why I didn't make sure Marge got everything on the list. I didn't really feel it was my place to manage Marge like that. I never even saw the list, so it's not like I could have just gone and gotten the wine myself, because I had no clue the list wasn't being adhered to. My girlfriend said I should have texted her when I realized we hadn't gotten her favorite wine. I didn't really notice. For all I knew they had a bottle at the house.

My girlfriend thinks I was being cheap and lazy, but I don't think it's reasonable to expect me to know that Marge would go off list. Also, it's just wine. The wine served with dinner was fine. Is it really that big a deal?",0
"My stepmother (49F), who we'll call Mary, is a conservative, and also does extreme racist things, which I'm not going to delve into right now. She got married to my dad when I was 14, and after she moved in, she used to force me to diet, and tell me that men liked women who did this, and that.

She and my dad moved into my apartment as they lost their house due to the virus. They are not paying any expenses, or chipping in.

Yesterday at dinner, I told them my boyfriend was moving in with us, and she replied with ""India? Which state is he from?"" and I tell her Kerala. So she tells me that he can't move in with us because he's from Asia, and Kerala is a dirty place where uneducated people live, etc, that he can't move into her house, and that I need to break up with him ASAP.

I told her that she doesn't own my apartment, and if she doesn't like him being in MY apartment, she can move out. Also called her out for her racism and ignorance. 

She got up crying and rushed into my bedroom. Heard things being thrown around and breaking, so I went in, and found a ceramic music box my grandpa got me shattered in pieces. 

I was furious. My grandpa is dead, and that was one of the only things I had from him. I actually snapped. Told her that she isn't my mother, and she can't go around having tantrums and did some other things I'm not ashamed of, and then kicked her out.

My dad says that I should apologise, and I told him he might as well get out of my house as well.
Boyfriend moved this morning, and my actual mom did too. These are the only two people who think Mary had it coming. My dad called me up an hour ago, and told me that I really hurt her with my comments, especially the one where I told her she was not my mom, and so I blocked him.

My step aunt caught wind of this, and told me I was an ungrateful brat what with her taking care of me my entire childhood when my ""failure of a mother couldn't."" 

So, Reddit, AITA?

UPDATE: A lot of people have been wondering if I can get if fixed, and I am getting it fixed!
Thankyou to u/CoffeeBeanx3, who told me there's a method of fixing porcelain objects with kintsugi! Will try to post a photo when I get it fixed :)

"Before anyone panics, his dog is okay now. Got to the vet in time, but she vomited and had diarrhea for a while.

I've been around dogs since I was a kid but he only got his first ten months ago. Last night he came over to my apartment and we had some curry together. I cooked. He asked if he could take some home. Now I've seen him share food with his dog twice. He said he did it occasionally. I figured he'd already know his dog shouldn't have the curry, which is spicy and has a lot of onion and garlic, but it turns out he didn't.

He shouted at me over the phone saying I should've warned him since I knew he sometimes share his food with her and said it's my fault she got sick.

"I (21F) am bilingual in Chinese and English. English is what I'd consider my ""native language"" and my mom has always been OBSESSED with getting the ""perfect"" English accent. My mom moved to the US from China just for some background and she has a semi-thick (6/10) Chinese accent. I've lived in the US for my whole life. For lack of a better example, my Chinese accent is similar to the girlfriend in ""[Fresh Off the Boat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLD8L7rsu2M)"". 

Everyone I ask (classmates, teachers, etc.) tells me that they don't really notice my accent and only hear it if they're listening for it but my mom just doesn't believe it. I don't even understand what she doesn't believe or what she thinks a perfect accent is. Just recently, my mom heard me talking to a friend in English over the phone and commented that my accent is thicker than my friend's (Indian). My mom said that maybe I should go to ""speech therapy"" to get my accent corrected and I told her ""no need."" I think it's totally fine to get a better accent, but the way my mom's creepy about it irks me.

Then, yesterday, my mom suddenly brought up that I should *really* go to speech therapy again and I snapped and told her to butt out of my business. Only she cares that I have a slight accent and I think it's totally fine since I speak both Chinese and English. Isn't it normal for everyone to have a slight accent anyways? It's not like I'm trying to be a news anchor. Then, she got mad at me and we had a fight about how ""I'm never going to get ahead in life"", ""no one at work will like me if I have an accent"", etc. I'm also exhausted that she's trying to force her ideals on me even though I'm about to graduate college ffs. 

;tldr my mom keeps insisting I get speech therapy for my slight Chinese accent that nobody else thinks is a problem, but she also won't respect my opinions. (Disclaimer: I think it's totally fine to get speech therapy, so I don't have an opinion on that itself. I just don't want it shoved down my throat.)",0
"AITA for refusing to eat with my friend because he’s vegan? 

Let me explain.

I met my friend Alex in my second year of university when we were both cast in a play together. We hit it off with similar interests and decided to live together last year. 

A bit of background: Alex is a vegan - and I mean that as literally as I can. He is a philosophy student and LOVES debating. I think he also has a bit of a superiority complex. Alex talks constantly about the immorality of eating meat. He brings it up daily. He has posters of animated cows looking sadly at steaks hung in his bedroom. He has said, and I am directly quoting, that “Eating meat is the same thing as defending slavery because you don’t think the lives of black people have meaning.” He has said “Eating meat is the equivalent of joining and supporting ISIS.” 

He is not joking. 

He calls anyone who eats meat “carnist pigs”. He says this to their face while they eat. He believes it is his life’s mission to educate people out of eating meat and awaken them to veganism. If we are in line together in a restaurant and someone else is ordering, he’ll judge and mock them (out loud) for ordering anything meat or dairy related. He’ll constantly say “Hey, check this out!” and show you whatever vegan food he is eating, going into detail about the ingredients and where they come from. By constantly, I mean nearly every time he eats a meal, he does this. He’ll come into your room to show you his plate. 

Now, I don’t disagree with him morally. We’ve had dozens of debates on the subject philosophically and I concede on many of his points. There’s no doubt that eating meat is a morally fraut issue. Where I take issue is that he deliberately tries to make people feel guilty for their dietary choices. I have started eating out, or at other people’s houses. I’ve been packing my lunches in secret because I just don’t want to deal with him. 

If anyone tells Alex to piss off, he responds with “Cool, have fun murdering!” or “Enjoy your death sandwich!” 

So flash forward to today. We’re in line at a burrito restaurant. I’m ordering my usual thing, and he makes a comment about how I could fill my tortilla with veggies rather than support systemic murder. Similar to the crap he always says. 

I look him dead in the eye and tell him, “Man, if you don’t stop doing this shit when we eat, I’m not going to eat with you anymore. The way you behave is inappropriate and hostile and frankly, I’m not interested in being friends with someone who makes it their mission to humiliate people like this.” 

He laughed and told me to chill. I said I was dead serious. He hasn’t spoken to me since. Not sure the best thing to do here since our lease doesn’t expire until May. I’d love to be able to eat a pepperoni pizza in my home without being called a terrorist.

So, AITA? How should I go about navigating this? 

Edit #1: Obligatory wow, this blew up comment! Thank you for chiming in. For those of you saying this is pretty one-aided - like, yeah. I was mainly seeking advice on how to handle it going forward, and writing it down helps you clarify how crazy shit is when it happens. And I got a lot of helpful tips so thanks! 

For those asking why we are friends: he can be a great guy. We get along and agree on about 95% of other subjects. We have a history together now. I was used to him making jabs, but didn’t know he was this insufferable until we lived together. 

For those saying this is fake - man, I wish. I constantly tell him not to behave like a meme of himself. So I get why it might read that way, but he’s legit.",0
"I’m fairly into health and fitness, and a large part of that is is eating the right amount of calories overall + protein intake. I find tracking calories to be tedious, and never was a big foodie so as a result I’ve lapsed into eating the same foods almost daily, and that works for me even if it’s ‘boring’. My diet on a usual day consists of oatmeal with fruit/nuts, eggs, protein shakes, and vegetables. 

My girlfriend says she feels uncomfortable by how healthy I eat. She’s very healthy herself, but a foodie, and tends to cook/eat a lot more elaborate meals than I do. She says my daily intake makes her feel I’m secretly judging her for eating less healthy than I am.

I’m not, because what works works. If she’s able to eat what she likes and still manage to feel and look great, then by all means. Same goes for me: if I’m able to meet my goals, and not get tired of what may seem a boring diet, then also I think that’s fine.

The issue is she disagrees, and asks me to start eating her cooking/follow her diet. I don’t mind doing so once or twice a week, but doing so every day would be detrimental to my goals, so I declined. 

This made her angry, and she said I was an AH for being inconsiderate. AITA?",0
"Some background - this friend and I have known each other for about 7 years. We've had our ups and downs, mostly because she has had a tendency to be narcissistic and not respect my boundaries (like don't corner me at a party and discuss your medical concerns with me at length). 

We've been on the outs for a few weeks, ever since she kind of took advantage of me by begging me to drive her 3 hours to an airport (twice, since I had to pick her up too, a total of 12 hours driving). She didn't offer me money or to treat me to dinner or anything because she was broke after her European vacation. On the drive back, I had a conversation with her about how I felt used, she apologized, and promised to make it up to me. 

Well, we have barely even spoken since she got back from her trip. Literally it's been a couple memes back and forth, that's it. 

Then yesterday she sends me a long paragraph text about how she was so scared because she thinks she had a miscarriage, even though she's on birth control, even though the pregnancy test came back negative. And added more details complaining about how the doctor rescheduled her appt and was making her late for work, etc etc. 

I literally didn't care at all, because it simply seemed dramatic to me. This situation was just a false alarm, like her cycle probably just got messed up from the travel.

And I'm pretty annoyed because not once has she reached out to ask me how I'm doing since she got back from her trip, chat me up, get together, anything. Then she just dumps this on me out of nowhere via text. It seemed like she was just trying to garner sympathy or pity from me.

I just ignored her completely. Said nothing. AITA?

Further, WIBTA if I told her exactly what I was thinking?",0
"My sister is a trainwreck. She needed a place to stay and I have a large enough home for an extra person. She has no job or income. I told her she has a few months to get her shit together and leave. I give her about $100 a week to keep my house clean so she has some cash.

I gave my sister her $100 and she said I owed her more. I was confused. She said she did other ""work"" for me. I asked her what more did she do? She said she walks my dog in the afternoon. I walk my dog every morning and evening. But she takes him with her on her afternoon walks. She said the going rate for a dogwalker is $25 per walk. 5 X $25 = $125 on top of the $100.

Then she mentions she put together a scrapbook of personal letters and papers. According to her and Etsy, that job was easily another $75. 

I told her I never gave her permission to do those things. Her argument is that those jobs fell under the umbrella of keeping the house clean and I was ripping her off.

So I threw her out. 

The money isn't the issue. I have plenty of disposable income. I was disgusted how she came at me.",0
"I am 25, my sister is 29 (I also have a younger sister, 8). When I was 14, my mom sent me to live with her parents. Her excuse was that they needed me to help out. I believe she just didn't want to deal with a growing male teen.

My grandparents owned an amazing property in the mountains that has an amazing view. We also have some horses and other critters. They were also quite wealthy as well.

They both passed 4 years ago a month apart. They gave me the property (because ""I would appreciate and respect it more"") while my mom and sister(s) got money and other assets(overall valued moer than the property).

In the past 4 years, I turned part of the property into a venue for mainly weddings (GPs knew of this idea and thought it was a good one).

We are busy and usually booked about 8 months out. My sister got engaged 1.5 years ago and said she wasn't to get married at the property. I said yes, just let me know the date as soon as possible so I can make sure it is ""booked.""

I never got a date. I followed up several times and kept asking her, and she would brush me off. 2 weeks ago I got the wedding invitation. Stating the property is the location and the date. Which is in September of this year. I immediately called her to say that we have booked for that date and can't accommodate her.

Well, now her, my mom, other family, her partners family, as well as other flying monkeys have been blowing up on me. They are also calling and writing reviews for my business.

I asked them to stop and call my sister telling her that I literally all she had to do was tell me when she knew her date so I could block it and I would take care of everything else.

She went off on how I am ruining HER day. It is OUR family's property. How she already sent out the invitations and couldn't go back now. I should just tell the other couple to cancel (they have been on the books for over a year now, and I actually like them). Family is more important.

After the last big blow-up, I started communicating strictly through the business. Using our recorded line as well as email. I suggested 3 other dates around the same time, but that's not good enough. ""I'm being resentful and an AH.""

TLDR: I own a property/popular wedding venue property that my sister wants to get married on, but she didn't tell me the dates until a few months before. It is booked for the day she wants. She already sent out invitations (how I found out). Since I won't cancel the other couples' reservations, I'm being called an AH. 

ETA Thank you all for the overwhelming response. I thought I was going crazy. I'll try to respond to prople later when I have some time. Thank you for all the advice and responses.

ETA #2.  Wow. There is no possible way I can respond to everyone. I have been taking notes about what people are saying and will go through the process as I have time. Most likely Monday. I plan on getting in contact with the couple and see if I can take them to dinner or something to explain the situation. I'm thinking of giving them a discount, getting a guest list, and being tight on security on our part.

Thanks, everyone!

ETA 3. I'm so blown away by the responses. The coming weeksnate is going to be busy. I probably won't update until most of everything is settled.

But I am going to reach out to the other couple.

Have a sit down with my sister. As well as my mom.

I have a meeting with a lawyer later this week. 

And finally I'm sorry but I'm not going to name my business for reasons. Thanks for the offers of writing good reviews, but I can't accept it. I like to earn everything I have or am given. I have made a lot of contacts in this business and am now having to call on them to help me out.

Just do me a favor. Be kind to everyone. Show love, compassion, and respect.",0
"    So… context. My significant other and I have been living together with my family for years. He’s hot tempered and my grandmother, who seems to have early onset dementia constantly blames him for everything. Not that he’s blameless but she is one of those “my way or the highway I am miserable all the time and want to show you how bad you are at everything” people.
     The two of us pay for a room in the house. It’s cheap to be sure and we’re making attempts to find a place to live but it’s difficult. Recently our mutual best friend started dating someone who has family that he really gels with. Now neither of us don’t have any exclusive friend groups so he’s trying to branch out with them and so when he goes to their house I tend to stay home or not get invited. This however coincided with a blow out we had with my grandmother later in the week. 
 
    As a result for like 4-5 days a week for the past 3 weeks he’s always going over to the family’s house. And since my other best friend is dating the family member the end result is they both are constantly over that house while I’m home by myself. 

    I’ve made it known that I’ve been feeling lonely and left out but he’s not the greatest at emotional intelligence so I guess I wasn’t obvious enough. It reached a head today since I had work at 5, he was off. I asked if he had plans. He said idk. The plan was to cook dinner tonight. I get home and he’s gone. Call him. He says “hey sorry I’m heading over to blahs house again but don’t worry I’ll be back soon.” Fast forward to 1230am that night. He comes in and asks “Are you ok?” We get into a small argument ending with me saying well if you hate being in this house so much maybe you should move out we are basically just roommates at this point

After trying to sleep for three hours after our two minute argument, he grabbed his work clothes and said he’d be sleeping in the parking lot at work in his car. I tried to talk to him and tell him not to

"
Me (41f) and my husband (42m) have been married for 10 years and have 2 kids. My husband's family are lovely, but don't seem to talk about anything difficult. My SIL (40f), let's call her Daisy, lives at home with them. Daisy has always lived at home and struggles with managing her finances. She's great at her job, but is on minimum wage, and her parents pay for her car, accommodation, food, phone etc. My MIL (78m) and FIL (80m) are retired and have enough savings to go on nice holidays etc, and so this is not an issue for them. SIL will make some unnecessary purchases, eg. Bought a new apple laptop to upgrade her one which was 3 years old, uses high-end hair products and cosmetics, is subscribedto all the streaming services, will regularly buy new clothing/ shoes etc. I wouldn't have minded any of this, except recently my MIL has recently been making comments along the lines of ""she'll be living with you when we're gone"", and implied we'll have to manage her car etc. They've done this joke before and don't do any of this conversation with my husband. I got a bit annoyed at this as no-one seems to think that there are any other options for her to improve her finances. (Eg. Parents could plan to one day move out of the large 4 bedroom house they are in, downsize and buy SIL a flat). If they don't make that plan then i worry she will spend anything she inherits and not have anywhere to live/ not plan. This happened with an earlier large inheritance she got from grandparents. When the topic of moving out has been brought up in the past by FIL, she just walks out of the room. My husband thinks it may have been a joke comment, and to not rock the boat. I know it's none of my business, so

WIBTA for asking them to make a financial plan for their daughter's future which doesn't involve ""Brother and SIL will just take on the role of parent"".",0
"Preemptive apology for formatting im on mobile

For context I, 15M and my mom 37F, recently got into a massive argument over me seeing my dad. 

My moms a major control freak, like blocks on my computer and phone to the point where I have to ask to do almost any individual actions. My father on the other hand is a firm believer in the idea of as long as I do good in school I can enjoy myself. But recently after my mom read through my texts of me venting to my dad about me not being able to do anything without asking for permission on my devices and not having anything of a social life since eight grade and she yelled at me about it and I got mad at her for violating my privacy by reading through my texts without my permission.

Eventually it devolved into me and her arguing over why I can't see him she said because he didn't treat her the best in the marriage (no beating or cheating just a lot of arguments between the two) and that he's racist and antisemitic, when I kid you not half of my dad's side of the family make under the bed look like the sun and my grandfather was Jewish and all of his friends are black. He's genuinely been friends with like three white people so I don't see the argument. and she thinks he's a negative influence because on me.

After the argument she cursed me out over asking why I can't see him saying and I quote ""asking why, the fuck do you think I am some type of granola mom? You don't get to ask why when I tell you something."" While I understand they aren't on good terms I don't see why this means I can't have a dad.",0
"I (17f) have 3 sisters, each 11. My parents adopted them 2 years ago. They were a strange case, we don't know their exact birthdays, any relatives, even for certain their names, at least the ones they were given by their parents. The most disturbing aspect is the fact that they each have number tattoos on their upper backs (2, 4 and 9). But we hardly know what their lives before us were like, because any questioning about their pasts greatly upsets one of them, so the other two have promised to never talk about it either to cheer her up.

I took them to the pool and said we could stay for a while. But one didn't zip her swimsuit all the way, so her tattoo showed. A woman saw it, interrogated her for a bit, but didn't get any response because 1. this girl has selective mutism, and 2. she's the girl who is really upset by questions about her past, so she was crying.

She went up to me as I exited the bathroom, and asked what the hell I was doing to them, I explained the tattoos, she didn't believe me and began to yell, so I left.

" In my girlfriends (Britney) church they wear white garments but whenever the women are on their periods they wear their own clothes to avoid staining the garments.

As I was driving home from picking up the girls, our daughter Haley asked why she can't go anywhere near the altar while she's on her period. Britney answered with ""When your on your p3ri0d you are dirty and you can never bring dirt near the altar,"".

My daughter looked confused but sat quietly, I kept quiet but I was going to bring it up when we got home. We drove in silence for 15 minutes.

When we got home Haley ran up to her room and I asked Britney why she would say that and I don't think it's appropriate to make our daughter think she is dirty for something she can't control. She said "" Haley isn't dirty, her period is dirty and I really don't think a male is the one to be talking about this topic"". I said I may not know the most about periods but I know I would never make my daughter feel dirty because she has one like every girl her age.

She started crying, ran upstairs to our bedroom and locked the door. I'm writing this at night on the couch in my day clothes with no blanket because she has refused to let me in.

Maybe what I was saying was dumb? Maybe I overstepped and should've asked Haley how she felt before bringing it up with Britney. If I'm wrong, I'll accept that and apologise to her. I feel terrible for being responsible for her crying. But was what she was saying right?

EDIT: Britney is Haley's mother alot of your opinions are based on the fact that she's just a girlfriend. Also I'm not apart of this church just Haley and Britney I'm sorry I thought it was clear. Also it's not always just white at their night services they wear yellow.",0
"for context my parents separated in 2016, and have had legal problems (alimony and what not) since then. Recently, my father got his car towed away for no apparent reason. He later on learned that it was a procedure started by the lawyers because he didn't pay his sum of the divorce (it's a lot). My parents never spoke to each other after 2016, it was always through me. So when he learned my mom was the cause of this, he kept calling me to help find a way for him to pay over a year. When I didn't call him back because I didn't have an answer for him he got angry. He removed me from two of our family groups, then unfriended me on facebook. He doesn't answer when I call and it just overall feels weird. He keeps blaming me saying that I could have done something but I just don't get it. It wasn't up to me. The one thing I don't get most is, he knows how much I care about my famiy on his side. Does he think removing me from a group will keep me away or what?

"I was told about this subreddit and created an account just to post this. Please use your judgement and tell me if I should apologize or not/ if I am an asshole. 

My sister had a baby about six months ago.  Since then the baby daddy has not really stepped up at all. They apparently are still together, but went from seeing her 5-6 days a week to maybe once a week. He doesn’t buy anything for the baby. He does nothing. 

She constantly complains and is turning super bitter to the situation. She calls me everyday and does nothing but talk about her crap baby daddy. I asked her multiple times to give me updates on other parts of her life, but she will say one thing and then somehow tie it back to her baby daddy.  

Yesterday, she goes on a tangent about how she never would of had a baby if she knew she was going to be alone. I got irritated and asked how she didn’t see this coming. 

She then says “ what the hell is that suppose to mean? “

I say “ he has 3 other baby mothers, works a slightly above minimum wage job, doesn’t have reliable transportation. His other baby mothers have said that that he doesn’t do crap for their babies and there is no way 3 women are all lying.” 

She says “ he told me otherwise. I had no reason to believe. He said this was for the long run”

I say “ well it looks like he is taking a long run away from his responsibilities. I love you but your bitter. He is responsible for his kid but it’s no suprise what’s going on. The sooner you realize your a single mom, and take his ass to court for child support, the better off your be.”

"I (F21) gave my boyfriend (M22) my laptop to update his resume, then took it away when he opened other files on my laptop.  
My boyfriend needed my laptop to update his resume. To preface he doesn't have one because he rarely needs one. He lost his job recently so he has been applying for new jobs, i.e. needing to update his resume. When he asked for it I had no problem giving it to him at all. He has his own little folder on there with a few things he has needed to save in the past.   
A few days ago he asked for it, I gave it to him and left him to it. I came back a little later and sat next to him on the couch just scrolling on my phone. All of a sudden, I heard my voice coming from the computer. I looked up and saw he had opened one of my video files. I panicked and sort of snatched the laptop and kind of shrieked asking him what the heck he was going. He acted like nothing was wrong and asked what was that. I said, it's nothing why are you snooping thru my files? He said something along the lines of what's the big deal, and I responded with, well you didn't ask. The convo ended with him asking if he could watch it and I responded with a hard no and went to put my laptop away. If I'm honest it bothered me but I didn't think it was that big of a deal until today.  
Fast forward to today, and he asked for my laptop again. He said he noticed something on his resume that needed to be changed. I had an involuntary internal reaction, nothing serious just a little pit in my stomach but I didn't let it bother me for more than that second. He took the laptop did his little fix and then just sat there with the laptop open for a few minutes. I turned and asked for it back since it was obvious he was done, now scrolling on his phone with the laptop still in his lap. He said, what's it to you to have it right now since you're working on the desktop (I work from home and the desktop belongs to the company. I don't use it for anything other than when I am working). I said because he was done with it and honestly I just felt a little uncomfortable after he opened my video file without asking the other day. He got really defensive and walked out. I asked him to come back so we could talk. He did, and I explained how I was feeling embarrassed about the video because no one not even he knew I made them. I felt insecure because it felt like an invasion of privacy just like if he were gonna go thru my phone or notebook diaries. He got more upset and walked out. Now I feel bad and am questioning if I overreacted.  
AITA for reacting insecure or was this a reasonable reaction? How should I talk to him next? Do I let him watch them???

"This goes back 3 years when my mom and her girlfriend got engaged. My mom put in so much time and energy into organizing this wedding and was so excited. She sent out invites to all our family members 4 months in advance, & almost everyone confirmed they would be going. 

Barely a week before the wedding, she received several messages from aunts and uncles who said they wont be going because they had “other commitments” despite confirming they’d be there months prior. 
One of my aunts (my grandma’s sister) confronted my mom and said many weren’t going because they still didn’t agree with the fact that she was marrying a woman, including herself because it went against her “Christian views”, meanwhile my hardcore Christian grandma was more than happy to walk my mom down the isle. 

This upset my mom but she tried not to let it ruin her wedding. I however, was furious. Only my grandma, my mom’s sister, a few cousins, and another aunt attended the wedding; while my stepmom’s entire family came.

 What really pissed me off was that 2 wks later, my cousin who lives in a totally different state celebrated her sweet 16 and everyone who made excuses about not going to my moms wedding made the journey all the way over there and posted pictures all over Facebook. It really broke my mom’s heart and just felt like salt in the wound. I swore then that when I got married, everyone who did not show up to my mom’s wedding would not be invited to mine. 

Fast forward to now , me and my girlfriend of two years got married first week of March and I kept my word. The only ones we invited to our wedding was the family that did go to my mom’s, and one other aunt who did have a good reason for not being there at the time because she was recovering from surgery. 

We even invited my stepmom’s family too. 

Obviously my other family members found out and expressed their hurt over not being invited. I called them all out and said if they had a problem with my mom for being who she is, then they had a problem with me and I wouldn’t let toxic people be apart of a special day for me and my wife.
 My wife stood behind my decision, as did my mom.  
That still doesn’t seem to stop them from thinking it was a dick move and are turning it into a whole family drama because they think it was unfair to “punish” them for simply believing in something different. AITA?


EDIT: Wow thank you so much for all the love and support everyone! My wife is getting a kick out of these replies and I’ll respond to some when I have the chance. Also I know some of you were confused so I wanted to clarify that I am in fact a guy",0
"To give some backstory, we moved across the country to a state where I know zero people and my husband’s entire family is here. I work in child care. I watch 16 2.5-3yr old children, some very high needs, on a daily basis. My husband, our 3 yr old daughter, and my preteen son with autism and adhd currently live with his parents because we moved from out of state and need time to get on our feet. 

Most weekends our kids cousins spend Friday nights with their grandparents, meaning there are 4 kids in the house. They also have a family day with around 30 people every Sunday.  This weekend the kids stayed Saturday night also. I try to help as much as I can because grandma is disabled.

This morning I expressed to my husband that I wanted to get up early and help clean so that we could go to the store before family day so I could have some time out of the house, not at work. While I was making breakfast the other adults in the house decided that the men and two children would leave and that I would be staying to help with the other two children and clean. Rather than mentioning the fact that I had already expressed my needs, he proceeds to tell me the decision and tell me I’m being ridiculous for reacting with “Why am I the one that gets stuck here this time?” Because it has happened before. 

He says I need to stand up for myself and be a part of the conversation if I want to make decisions. I had heard my name mentioned while making breakfast and asked what was going on just to be told not to worry about it. Maybe I could have handled it better, but I felt trapped. On his days off he goes to the gym, to our friends house, and buys any little trinket his heart desires. On my days off I watch more children, plus ours, and have to be in a house full of his family with no time to myself, or time to get out of the house besides grocery shopping. 

 I also have shoes with no tread, and maybe 3 pairs of pants without holes in them. He says he is always telling me to go have time to myself or go buy what I need, but when it actually comes down to it he asks me “with what money” or “is that really a priority right now” meanwhile spending money on Lego sets for himself, his gym membership when we have nobody to watch our kids for for me to use his “pass” when he said I’d be able to. He’s telling me I need professional help and that I’m toxic and told me to go out by myself, but I have to be back in an hour for family day, and like I mentioned previously I know nobody. 

Yes, I screamed. Yes, it escalated. I had already mentioned what I wanted to do for the day. All I wanted was to get out of the house for ONE of my days off. I need some outside perspective. Am I toxic? AITA?",0
"My boyfriend and his mom were discussing holiday plans, he mentioned me possibly joining him to go visit his family for thanksgiving. She basically told him that she didn’t care to meet me at all. Her reasoning was that she’s tired of her son’s (he has two other brothers) girlfriends/wives cussing her out. She said if I were to meet her or come to thanksgiving, she would be polite to me but that she just doesn’t care to meet me based off of the other interactions from women in the past. She also stated that if we had babies together that of course she would want to meet them and be around and in their lives. I’ve never met his mom. The only interaction I’ve had was when he FaceTimed her and I was also on the phone. I wasn’t doing the talking but she told a story about him in high school and I was semi responding. I’ve met his siblings briefly via FaceTime but nothing too deep from the FaceTimes with any of his family members obviously. 

Am I the asshole for feeling some kind of way about this?? Especially since if I had a child with him she would care to be around them (which is typical and I understand but?) I feel like it’s a slap in the face to me? I would never disrespect his mother or cuss her out. I feel as though I deserve my own chance and I think it’s rude on her part. Am i reading too much into this?",0
"Here's the thing: I 27M proposed to my 26F fiancee(yay!). The proposal time was a surprise but the actual proposal was not, she knew it was coming for a while but this is where it starts to get a little weird. I got her advice and opinions on the *PERFECT* ring for her. We both make decent money but I wanted it to be special so I saved up about $9000 of my spending money over the years(we live together) so I can afford to have the perfect ring for her. She was pointing out this ring and that ring and these rings how perfect they were, what her ring size was, what kind of cut she wanted, what setting, what band, etc...


Anyways I landed on the perfect ring for her, she approved of it, and we were all set just waiting for it to be fitted properly. The ring came in about 3 weeks before the proposal and I made it special and she said yes, excitedly. I'm talking dinner, wine, roses, backrubs, movie in bed, THE WHOLE SHEBANG. There was not a detail I missed, I can assure you I went full perfect boyfriend(fiance now) lmao


Cue to now, which is now 5 weeks after the proposal, and suddenly the whole style of cut and setting that she wanted for her ring is awful. Apparently she made a HUGE mistake with what she wanted and now suddenly she doesn't like it. I asked her ""Maybe just wait a few weeks and see if your mind changes? You never know, maybe this is just proposal jitters or something"" and no she's adamantly against it. I told her in no uncertain terms that this ring cost me a lot of money and we did research for months(almost a full year) together and I thought her mind was made up. I can't return the ring so now I'm kind of fucked and she's crying and telling me to leave her alone all night tonight. I personally think she's being childish but I called my mom and she tells me that I should have gotten her something she wanted. I told her that I DID get her something she wanted but now she doesn't want it, now my mom is telling me to just sell it for a loss and get one she does want. I said fuck all that, not trying to be mean but I'm not going to return a ring that cost me almost 5 figures just because she changed her mind TWO MONTHS after I bought it and had proposed. I think she's talking to her friends now but idk what to think anymore. Am I being an asshole by not returning it? I could *technically* afford it but this will put a huge dent in my savings and our overall account in general not to mention how stressful all this has been for me.



edit: no longer engaged, she cheated on me

"So, this story took place about a month ago.
I (25F) have a friend (24F) that we'll call Ella.  Ella has a 9m old son that we'll call Jack.
Ella and I met in college when we were 18/19yo and meet every few months for coffee and a catch up. Ella had a bit of a rough childhood as her mum priorities her 1/2 siblings over her and her stepdad was emotionally abusive. Jack was an accident baby with her boyfriend but she vowed to never have him grow up like she did.
I've met jack maybe 5 times since he was born, and I've noticed a few times that his clothes were a bit dirty, he was generally a bit smelly (not like poop, but just generally unwashed) and his fingernails were long and very dirty. But honestly, he's a baby, they make alot of mess and he was such a happy little boy that I didn't think much of it.
Then out if the blue, Ella calls me, in floods of tears saying someone called social services on her because she was raising jack in an unsafe environment. I calmed her down and eventually she said that SS were returning tomorrow to do a full house inspection, she said her house was a little messy but it wasn't that bad. Ella asked if I could come round and help 'straighten it up' so that it was perfect for the visit.
Of course I agreed to help and got on a bus to go to her house. I've never been to her house before as its on the other side of town but I was HORRIFIED. I completely understood why SS had been called.
There was mouldy food on the floor, empty food packets and energy drink cans everywhere, cigarette butts everywhere and I even saw some broken glass.
She was still distraught, so I kept my opinion to myself and helped her tidy. It took the two of us nearly 8 hours to tidy it all to what I would consider an 'acceptable standard' as opposed to a very tidy/clean house. Jack was happily playing the whole time and when I left, I said ""it should be easier to keep on top all this of now the bulk is done"", I felt like that was enough of a dig as she was exhausted.
I went home, she told me the next day that she passed the inspection and was very happy. She invited me round the week after for dinner to say thank you for helping.
I went round and it was AWFUL again, just a week after cleaning it all. This time there was a dried cat poo on the rug...
I felt sick and took a secret video of the lounge/kitchen and then made an excuse about being unwell and left.
I forwarded the video to a friend of mine who is a social worker and another investigation has been opened into them.
Ella called me to tell me and when I said I'd reported her, she flipped and screamed at me, and has been posting vile things all over social media about me and I've been recieving death threats from her family.

All these messages have made me question if AITA for filming in her house and reporting her?",0
"My boyfriend and his best friend are exchanging clothes. We have been dating for 9 months and only recently I have discovered that after fully introducing me to his friends a few months ago, I have been hesitating to say anything about it until now.

They exchange boxers, briefs, jackets, T-shirts...etc and it's just...weird. They are both good when it comes to money, they don't need clothes or anything, they just do it. When we have sex, I smell his best friend on him. When they go to the gym together, they exchange their outfits too. It's pretty frequent too, I even find some of his best friend's boxers and briefs in the laundry. I gently asked him about this and he said that it's because they love each other's scent and they feel very comfortable being this close to each other. I told him that this is a bit odd >!(I lied, it's so fucking weird!)!< and he said ""maybe but it's my best friend, do you have an issue with that?"" which kind of rubbed me the wrong way, I told him that yes, it bothers me because it's just weird and I'm setting some boundaries here.

He got pretty defensive, mad at me, and said that I have no business in this, it's his body, it's his best friend and they do whatever they want as long as they are not hurting anybody.

I still find it weird. AITA?",0
"A very popular hiking trail actually crosses my (privately owned) land that is nestled inside a national park. I’ve never objected to people crossing our land as I’m an avid hiker and don’t want to deny them enjoying the scenery, though it can get annoying at times when groups of 10+ people litter on my part of the trail.

Anyway, a few years ago my daughter decided to set up a small stop to sell cold drinks and snacks on the trail. It’s basically a caravan she lives in, but with an attached section to serve drinks and food. So she’ll spend her time in there and every now and then people will pass by and happily top up (it’s a multi day hike). 

It made a surprisingly large amount of money, and so we began taking turns spending time in the caravan on the off chance someone (or a hiking group) passes by.

Now, we live in a place that gets very humid in summer. It “feels like” 40-45 degrees Celsius during June-July. Today i was watching a movie in said caravan when a group of 5 girls rung the bell. They said they were out of water and asked if I could refill their water bottles. I told them I could for 50cents a bottle. The reason we charge money is that all of our water is rainwater and hence limited (especially in summer). We aren’t connected to an endless supply of water.

They were furious that I refused to top them up for free and said they are dehydrating and could faint from heat stroke. I told them where a clean creek was about 1hr down the trail that they could top up (I’ve drunk from there countless times, seriously no risk) but they refused and insisted I top them up. 

They had a young girl with them (around 13) while the rest were in their early 20s. So I refilled the young girl’s bottle and gave her a sprite for free, but insisted the adult women with her pay. They refused and very angrily went on their way. My wife says I should have filled them up, but IMO so long as the little girl is okay I don’t think they deserved anything given their attitude.",0
"Me (F36) and my husband Will (M35) have three kids Adam (M9), Maddie (F7) and Megan (F6). Will has always been into video games, Star Wars and anime etc. It’s never been my cup of tea but I think it’s healthy that we have separate hobbies and interests and we have other stuff in common. 

When we had Adam Will was super excited to share his interests with him and bought him Star Wars themed babygrows and toys etc. For Adam’s first Halloween Will dressed him up as Darth Vader and it was super cute. It was the same for the girls. I did tell Will that I had no issue with this while the kids were small but we had to let them develop their own interests. As it turns out both Adam and Maddie love playing computer games with their dad and have similar interests so there have been no issues. 

The problem now is that as Megan is getting older she is showing more interest in princesses and barbies etc and finds her dad and siblings’ interests boring. Will seems to have an issue with this and keeps trying to encourage Megan more towards his interests. At Halloween he seemed annoyed that Megan wanted to dress as Elsa as he always took pride in Maddie not dressing up as a princess like lots of her classmates. 

This Christmas it has come to a head as Will spent all of Boxing Day playing the switch with Adam and Maddie and helping them build Lego while leaving Megan out. Will has offered Megan to play with them but she wants to play with her new toys and the games that she likes. I played with Megan most of the day but she asked if she could play her new barbie game on the switch for a while with her dad. I told them all to let her have a turn and play the barbie game with Megan. Adam and Maddie were actually fine and seemed to have fun but Will kept making fun of the game and telling Megan that other games like Mario kart were far more fun.

I could see Megan losing confidence in wanting to play the game and she started to say she didn’t want to play anymore so I pulled Will aside and told him off and said that while he was a great dad to Adam and Maddie he was being a bad dad to Megan by ignoring her interests. Will was really, really hurt by being called a bad dad and has been quiet ever since. The kids are now starting to notice that their dad is upset. I’m now wondering if I was too harsh as he is generally a good dad and I do know that he loves Megan as much as he loves Adam and Maddie.

Edit- thank you all for your comments, it’s been really helpful to read through them all although some were hard to read. Will saw this post which I have to admit to myself I knew was a possibility as I used real names. We are going to have a long talk after the kids are in bed this evening but he has apologised to Megan and surprised her with tickets for the Frozen musical in the west end and they are currently making plans for a daddy daughter day out to London to have fun and see the show. I’m hoping this was the kick up the arse he needed as I do genuinely believe he is a good dad and a good man.",0
"I (21F) have pretty bad memory issues for someone my age. Short term memory is pretty much shot. I do what I can to help me remember things; lots of sticky notes, notes in my phone, reminders for small things, etc. 

With this being said, any time I enter a relationship, I often times either create a folder in my phone or buy a small notebook. I’ll fill it with important things about my partner - birthday, full name, some of their favorite things - things that I may not remember that well. I add to it as the relationship goes on, and it helps with gift-getting, remembering dates and important aspects of our relationship. 

My friend saw my notebook the other day, and decided to flip through it. A small chat later, she was grilling me and calling me incredibly creepy for writing this down and keeping it (the notebook stays in my purse at all times unless taken out to write in). I got a bit defensive and explained it’s solely to do with my memory and helping with it. We haven’t talked in a few days since. 


So AITA for being defensive over keeping these notebooks? (After a relationship is over, the papers are usually shred or burned)",0
"My sister got upset at me for not spending the whole day with her for her birthday. For some background information, about 2 months before her birthday my mom had surgery done (we do not have the same mom but she is still my sister <3). the weekend of her birthday was my moms first day back at work (we are waitresses and we work at the same place). The dr said she could go back as long as she doesn’t carry heavy stuff and whatnot. When my sister told me her birthday plans about how she wanted to do brunch in the morning and dinner in the evening I told her that was fine but that I would for sure be there for her dinner only. She got upset and asked why I couldn’t just take the whole day off to be with her, and I explained to her that I needed to help my mom at work and make sure she’s okay and that I really couldn’t afford to take a day off due to me being in my schools Musical and I would need some saturday’s off for rehearsals and I wanted to work as much as I could to replace some of those saturday’s that I would miss. She was hurt and decided to change her plans for the entire day and said what was the point of keeping the plans if I wasn’t going. Fast forward to a week after her birthday (today) she called me and asked if I was at work and I said “No I had rehearsals this morning”, we continued to have a normal convo. After we hung up she texted me a few minutes later saying “Im gonna be real honest....im real hurt right now bc i try not to ask u for much. But u took a day off for school, but not for a big birthday celebration for me, which i never ask of you. I rarely ask you for things ever for my birthday and this is how i get treated. I'll remember that.”  So am I the asshole?",0
"I 25f used to live in a 2 bed flat with my friend. She moved out last month, and got her friend Ava to take over her tenancy. I work long hours and am barely at home, and even then it is to sleep mostly and sometimes I go see my boyfriend. We share a bathroom, kitchen and living space. I have to walk past the kitchen to get to my bedroom.

Ava's boyfriend got her flowers Thursday, and she put the bouquet in a vase on the kitchen counter. I have hayfever, and the flowers make me sneeze and my eyes itch. When I saw Ava that same day, I asked her politely to put the flowers in her room as I have allergies. She said she was on her way out for a run, and would do so by the time she got back. I went into the kitchen the Friday morning and saw the flowers were still there. I tried knocking on her door, and when she didn't answer left her a text reminding her to move the flowers.

After work on Friday, I went to my boyfriend's and stayed over for the weekend. We got into a fight and I left early Sunday morning instead of staying the whole weekend. I was in a bad mood when I got home, and when I saw the flowers still on the counter I was even more irritated. I checked my messages and saw Ava had read my message but not responded, and I knew she was in the flat over the weekend as there were dishes in the sink. I binned her flowers and went to my room.

Ava saw me come in today after work and is called me TA for binning her flowers and wants me to reimburse her for the bouquet. She told our friend (ex-flatmate) who agrees with her. I feel justified as I was annoyed and I had asked her twice and it is my kitchen too.

eta- The flat is really small. Her bedroom door is next to the bathroom, so I would still have a reaction to the flowers. We don't keep our rooms unlocked, and don't go in each other's room.",0
"My (16M) brother (14M) came to me today laughing telling me that he had to show me something. I was confused on what he was laughing about and he gave me his phone and told me to scroll. When I looked at his phone I noticed that he was on instagram messaging someone. 

I was confused on what I was reading until I saw that he was repeatedly saying the N word. This made me more confused and I started scrolling up more to see what would prompt him to say that but when I scrolled up I saw that he was the one who messaged the boy first. I asked him why he would say that and asked him if the boy did or said something to him first but he just kept laughing and saying that he ""was just bored.""

 I told him that it wasn't funny and that he should apologize and then he told me that he was just joking and that the boy already blocked him. I again told him that it was really weird that he decided to do that just because he was bored. He got mad at me and told me that it ""wasn't that deep"" and that I ""shouldn't be so sensitive."" 

I asked him again why he said that unprovoked but he just rolled his eyes and walked out of my room. I was gonna tell our dad but I'm not sure if I should tell since he already got blocked so it's not like he could do it again?",0
"Last Friday, my brother went to minor care for what he thought was just a bad virus.   It turns out he had sepsis and he was hospitalized immediately with half hour regimen of antibiotics ($800 a bag).  My father and I flew down to see him and found out that his husband had left Friday night to go on a short vacation to Mérida, Mexico with his family.   My brother was in the ICU till Monday with the doctor unsure if he was going to survive. Thankfully we were able to take him to his home on Monday afternoon but he has to get a battery of tests to see what damage this did to his organs.  

Last night,  my brother's husband returned as if nothing had happened and was showing all the crap he brought home from Mexico. I tore into him about how insensitive he was and called him a crappy spouse for abandoning my brother in a time of need.  He responded that ""nothing happened"" and ""my brother is fine"" so there is no need for hostilities.  He had also commented that gay marriages are different and I wouldn't understand.

Where I think I went too far is I remarked that if a gay spouse means you are stuck with an uncaring bastard like him, I don't understand why anyone would get married in the first place.

This morning my brother said his husband cried most of the night and I was too hard on him.  So I'm thinking maybe I need an outside opinion because everyone with an opinion here is way too close to the situation to be objective. 

So AITA?",0
"My fiance (27M) and I(25F) are about to marry by the end of this month. I am Indian and Hindu by religion and he is German and Christian. I had already planned everything with my fiance about this, that we will have two ceremonies, one according to his faith and one according to mine (basically what Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra did haha). Our respective parents were also okay with it. The reason for this arrangement was not just because of religion, but because our families live in different countries and I wanted everyone to get a chance to see us tie the knot. Basically I was planning to do the ceremony according to my faith in India since my extended family can't join us in Germany. Our respective parents were supposed to join us in both ceremonies though. 

Well apparently my mother did not know how Christian weddings are held, specifically the kissing in public part.
One of my siblings must have told her and now she's refusing to be a part of the celebration in Germany and is insisting that I cancel the ticket. She thinks it's obscene and beneath our culture to get married like that. She is further pressing us to have our marriage in India only by saying that it's excessive to get married twice. Which means my fiance's extended family and friends won't be able to join us. She keeps calling me selfish and extravagant and is accusing me of showing off my salary to her relatives (who never liked me anyway and constantly kept critisizing everything I did). My fiance wants to compromise with her but I've honestly have had enough. 

AITA if I decide to go with two weddings anyway?",0
"I (32F) have a 12 month old daughter. She was EBF for the first 6 months of her life and we continued to give her breast milk after starting solids. Since she was born, I have been an overproducer of breast milk - I have been able to pump more milk than she can eat and built a freezer stash that allowed me to wean her and pump a few times a day when I went back to work 12 weeks later. I’ve even been able to donate a lot through a local hospital. Even though DD is a year old and can start drinking cows milk instead of breast milk, she has a severe dairy allergy. Her doc suggested that we continue to give her breast milk along with soy milk. I was able to stop pumping two months ago and should have enough milk for the next 2-3 months and I intend to use all of it. 

The relative in question is my cousin, Leslie (30F). We haven’t spoken in years, mostly because she likes to badmouth me and my immediate family to other relatives for reasons I’m not clear on. She has a lot of issues and projects them onto others. Leslie had a baby last month and has had some struggles breastfeeding her son due to a poor latch and a low supply. So imagine my surprise when I got a phone call a couple of days ago from Leslie. Our talk went like this:

L: I hear you have a large freezer stash of breast milk you pumped for your baby. I cant breastfeed or pump, and the formula my baby needs is very expensive. Any chance you have milk that you’re not going to use that I can have?

OP: Sorry, I can’t help you. All the milk I have left is for DD. 

L: Really? You know they can drink cows milk at one year. 

OP: DD is allergic to milk and her doc recommended we continue giving her breast milk for as long as we can. 

L: Can’t you just pump more and give me what you have left?

OP: Uh, no, my milk has dried up so I can’t just make more. If you want, I can connect you to a donor milk group on FB and I personally know some people looking to sell their extra milk. I can see if they’d give you a good deal.  

L: Seriously? Donor milk is way more expensive than formula!

OP: Sounds like you’ve found your solution because I’m not going to give you my extra breast milk. That milk belongs to my child. 

L: I can’t believe you, you’re such an AH! Family should help each other!

OP: I don’t have to give you anything, family or not. Even if I wanted to give away my milk, I wouldn’t give it to someone who constantly talks shit about me behind my back and acts as entitled as you do. I offered you a solution and you didn’t take it. Good luck! (Hangs up)

The next day I got a call from her mom berating me for not giving her daughter my milk and calling me a selfish AH, claiming that Leslie asked nicely and is “sorry for how she’s acted in the past.” Both proceeded to send me nasty texts until I blocked both their numbers. It’s my milk to decide what to do with, but am I being an AH by not at least sharing some of it?",0
"My (29F) SIL (33F) lives in the same community as me and my husband (32M). She and her husband had plans to come by our home after they came back from picking up their 1 year old son from her mom’s house. When they arrived she was extremely angry and distraught and explained that her husband dropped her and baby off while he looked for parking, but she saw a spot open up nearby so she tried to hold it by standing in the spot with her son in stroller. A man got to the spot first and started to back his car into the spot despite seeing her and the baby there and she was forced to move out of the way. She said she went off on him, cursing and saying that he’s an evil person to steal a parking spot from a baby and to endanger them by backing into the spot. The man apparently gave her a big F you and said her name isn’t on the spot. 

Honestly, I wanted to stay neutral on the matter, especially after my husband confirmed with her and via house camera that the man very slowly backed in and clearly was not trying to run them over. SIL was clearly upset and shaken up over it but she kept talking about how awful the man was hours after they arrived and her husband kept validating her which made her  feel like my husband and I would be on the same page. She kept asking for our input and we kept skirting around it with plenty of “that’s crazy” and “so sorry that happened to you”. I had enough of it and told her that I am sorry that that happened to her and that I understand that it was scary, but even though it wasn’t her intent, she was the one endangering her child by forcing herself and baby into the road to hold a spot. There were plenty of other parking spots (she should know as she lives in the neighborhood) and she can’t assume that everyone will pass her by when they see her holding a spot just because she has a baby. What if the man got angry and backed in without giving her time to move? I also told her that she can’t force anyone to not take a public parking spot. 

She got huffy and said that she knew I wouldn’t understand because I’m not a parent and that I can’t comprehend how traumatic the experience was for her. Her husband said that the man should not have backed into the spot and just talked to her if he needed it that badly. I told them that I do understand that it was scary for SIL and that it was messed up for the man to back in, but ultimately, no one is entitled to a public parking spot and she shouldn’t have put her and baby in the street to begin with. They decided to leave when they couldn’t get me to agree with them and my husband and I feel bad because SIL genuinely was shaken up. Just wondering if we are AHoles and should apologize and make peace.",0
"I (16f) have an older sister (Ari, 19f) and a group of 6 (including me) friends. My friends and I go and hang out once in a while. Though, we don't get to a lot because two of us has jobs, one goes to church on Sundays and Tuesdays, and two have strict parents.

Two years ago, she met a girl (Lana, 17f) and slowly fell in love with her. It was really toxic. Ari often came to me to complain about dating someone younger and how they never understand anything and that it was her last time ever dating someone younger than her. But Ari really loved Lana and stayed with her despite her (now ex) girlfriend having plenty of mental and personal issues, but one time, it got so bad that Ari went to her friends about it. I'm assuming they have heard the same complaints I have and forced Ari to either break up with her girlfriend or choose them. Ari chose Lana (whom she's known for two years) over her friends (where she has known all of them since they were in elementary). That day, they cut Ari off and she's been dependent on her ex-girlfriend for companionship since.

About two months ago, my friends and I finally agreed on a date to hang out at one of our places once we all got approval. When I told my parents about it, they suggested I bring Ari along since she stays home all day and does nothing (their words, not mine). Ari used to go out almost all the time with her friends, which my parents were okay with as well as long as they knew where she was going and who was there. I guess they noticed she hasn't been as active since last year.

I told my parents no, because why would someone bring their sibling to a hangout with friends who aren't close to one another? I personally think it's awkward and weird. My parents kept trying to convince me, and I got fed up. I snapped and told them that it wasn't my fault that she lost all her friends and I shouldn't be responsible for getting her new friends. My parents yelled at me for being rude, but still let me go anyway since they did agree that I was not responsible for introducing her to new friends.

I've been thinking about it for a few days, and I feel really guilty for what I said. I've been in her position before, except I had everything work out and didn't have to choose a side. I know the mental toll it has taken on Ari, so I should have been more considerate about what I said. AITA?",0
"I have a almost 3 year old. We have lived in our apartment, which is a duplex, for about a year, we are the top apartment, with one below us. We had a previous downstairs neighbor who was a 60ish y/o man and his tiny dog. We all got along great with no issues whatsoever, other than him being quite the talker with some old school views. When his lease was up he moved somewhere cheaper. 
We then got new downstairs neighbors. We think there’s 2 of them? We tried to be very neighborly, even plowing their parking spots for them when it snowed, always shoveling the sidewalks, taking their garbage can to the curb when they forgot etc. Nothing overbearing or weird, just like common courtesy stuff.
 After about a month I noticed them starting to bang on the ceiling when my toddler would run from one room to another, we then tried to explain to him not to run since there is people below us. Then, we started getting emails from our rental company stating that they keep filing noise complaints. They said they sent in a video to show the noise but it's literally just my toddler feet sounds, even the rental company stated that they only heard the ""pitter patter of baby feet"". Then they left a passive aggressive note stating that ""they live here too"" ""they work so hard they should be able to enjoy their time at home"" and that we are causing things to fall off their walls. I should also note that we also live 10 feet from the train yard, which is never silent, always causing what feels like earthquakes.
We do not live in a quiet area. I left a note, with my phone number, stating that if they work strange hours, we would be more than happy to try to accommodate those hours, otherwise, we will continue how we've always been, which is making sure our toddler is quiet between
9:30pm-9:30am. No response. Then recently, we get an email from our rental company saying that every day they get an email noise complaint from them about us. Every. Single. Day.
This also comes with them constantly banging at the ceiling every time they hear my toddler doing anything but walking. He's potty training and every time he runs to the potty they bang at the ceiling. I understand how frustrating being a downstairs neighbor can be, l've been there, but the expectation of my toddler being silent during the day seems insane to me and I refuse to oblige. I'm at a loss for how to help the situation but l'm also wondering if l'm an AH for not trying to make my toddler quieter during the day.",0
"Even since I was a kid, I’ve always hated my Chinese legal name. It’s really short and has negative connotations. When teachers say it out loud, I feel a tinge of shame. I plan on changing my first name to the English name I’ve been using since I was a kid, but that still leaves my last name. I like the last name “Komori”. Since I’m already East Asian no one will really question me or think I’m a weeaboo. But it also seems a bit culturally insensitive to give myself a Japanese last name without being actually Japanese. 

So, WIBTA?",0
"My niece (14)  has lived with me since her parents went to prison 5 years ago. Drugs. My sister is getting out later this year. She has been working very hard in prison to improve herself and got her GED. We are still very close and we talk via an app the prison provides and I take her daughter to visit her, a long with her brother, who lives with his dad's brother, once a month.

We were having a birthday dinner at my mother's for myself and my daughter, 16 . Most of my family was there. For my present my niece decided to give me adoption request papers or whatever they are ( I never ended up reading them).

I was stunned and just... Shook my head. I was so shocked and confused. The plan was she was always supposed to go home. My mother was upset by this request as well as my other siblings, and my husband couldn't think of what to do either. She never brought this up in counseling or anything. I can't do that to my sister, I would not be able to to take care of her without support financially from my grandma, who would stop supporting if I agreed. This was never even a thought.

Now she and my daughter hate me, it seems. My son, 21 , said it was probably some thing she got from tiktock and she will eventually get over it. My husband agrees with me, my siblings are staying out of it. My nephew isn't speaking to his sister now. It's a mess. AITA  here? Trying to get an outside opinion. Reddit seems as good a place as any.

"Hello Reddit! I could really use some help here. I’m stuck in a personal and moral dilemma and could really use some outside perspective.

Maybe to preface: my sister and I have a complex relationship, and despite our ups and downs we care for one another deeply. Let’s call her Mary. Mary is going to be marrying her long-term boyfriend/fiancé (who we’ll call Archie, 30 M I think?) and that’s where my problem lies. Archie is, in my eyes, a complete nightmare. He’s manipulative, abusive (yells and screams at her, insults her, breaks her things), and has a serious drinking problem. Moreover, his behavior is increasingly racist and he’s showing neo-Nazi tendencies.

My sister knows my stance, and to a certain extent knows it’s an issue, but it always comes back to “He’s actually a really nice guy.” “He’s trying so hard to change.” “I can change him.” kind of talk. It’s painful to watch. I’ve had to hide her from him, moved myself (and her) to keep her away from him, but she always makes her way back to this guy. We’ve reached a point that he blackmails her to keep her from seeing me, given my stance (which isn’t aggressive but is clear). She’s not “allowed” to visit me, he reads all our texts, and when I visit it can only be for a max of 2 hours and he needs to be there the entire time, quite literally hovering the entire time. 

By attending the wedding, I feel like I would be supporting this marriage, which goes against everything I believe in and will only end badly. On the other hand, I worry about damaging my relationship with Mary even further/us becoming more estranged, as well as I’d be missing out on a significant event and milestone of Mary’s. There’s the added aspect that due to him isolating her she quite literally has no friends, and I am the only bridesmaid/maid of honour.


Oh, it just occurred to me that this might be a factor that influences things: I have no poker face. Zero. I try to control my expressions and somehow it just makes it worse. People who see me look at him (when I am deliberately trying to be nice & polite) and who have no clue about the situation have made comments on how “if looks could kill.” I’ve noticed in candid Christmas pictures and such that I’ll have my lip curled etc. when he’s talking (sort of like I can smell what a POS he is, if that makes sense?) and just be glaring at him with such clear hatred. I honestly have no clue how I’d react in the moment (of the wedding), but I doubt I’d manage to be subtle. 

So, WIBTA if I refuse to go to/or be part of the wedding?

TLDR: sister’s fiancée is a terrible human being. They are getting married and I oppose this union but don’t want to become even more estranged from my sister.",0
"So all of this happened while we were on a roadtrip out of state. Me (15F), my parents (39M and 40F), and my sister (13F) had stopped at a gas station to find some food and use the restroom. 

Ill make it known, I already hate public restrooms.  Especially because of how little privacy they allow for. I also have some trauma from when I was younger, as a result I am very private and I get really upset when people intrude on my privacy or my bodily autonomy. 

So while I was in the restroom stall I was quite honestly HORRIFIED to see sombody looking into the stall and smiling like it was funny. When I realized it was my sister, I didn't know how to respond. It was mostly a mixture of shock, anger, and disbelief. 

Once I was out of the stall I started to berate her and I asked her what the f*** she was doing. What made her think it was okay to watch someone in the bathroom? What if it wasn't me in the stall? She got upset with me and left to find our parents. I followed her and when I found them, she was already telling our parents how I had cussed at her--I'm not allowed to swear especially at family members--and how I had yelled at her when she tried to tell me to hurry up. Conveniently leaving out the part where she looked into the stall. 

At first both of my parents were upset with me, and when I explained why I yelled at her, my dad seemed to calm down a bit more. I explained that I thought I was justified to be upset since she was looking into the stall. I asked my parents: ""What kind of a perverted freak looks into somebody's bathroom stall?"" I did say it pretty loud and some people did turn their heads. My mom got really upset and took my sister out to the car while me and my dad stayed in the gas station. My dad told me that what she did was wrong but that I shouldn't have said that, and I agree with him. 

When we went back out to the car, my mom and sister were still pretty mad at me and my mom told me that she was just a kid, she made a mistake, she's my sister so it shouldn't matter, and that she said sorry so it should be okay. 

I argued that she was 13 and she should know better. I told her I didn't care that she was my sister, her behavior was disgusting and I wouldn't let my mom try to justify it. 

My mom calmed down a bit more, she talked to my sister about it. They still feel like I overreacted and shouldn't have gotten so upset, but I feel like my emotions were valid. 

TLDR: My sister looked into my restroom stall so I called her a perverted freak in the middle of a gas station. 

So, am I the AH?",0
"At the beginning of this quarter, my office (medical clinic) made a few changes to everyday operations. One of those changes was that everyone (full time) would take lunch from 12:30 to 1:30 so that we could have a more cohesive schedule. I don’t like this change, but I’m not the practice director. 

We’re not a huge clinic but we have a few doctors plus their support teams, so there are still quite a few people in office. Since we’re in an office building with restaurants near by, some people will leave for lunch, however I rarely do, so I often use the microwave in the break room. 

I have a coworker (Jessica) who also often brings her lunch and uses the microwave. However,Jessica will often bring frozen meals, which is fine, but they take quite a while to heat up. Most take 5+ minutes without having to take it out and stir it and letting it sit. Since she is closer to the break room, she often gets there before I do leaving myself a few others to wait 5+ minutes while she finishes which cuts into our lunch time, especially if there are 4 or 5 people waiting. 

Yesterday, she brought a meal that took 10 minutes plus constant stirring. She usually eats in the break room (I don’t) so I decided to stick around and ask her if she could bring things quicker to heat or let others go first since I didn’t want to add a passive aggressive note to the microwave. The only other people in the break room besides us two were a coworker/friend of hers (Amanda) and another employee so it’s not like I singled her out in a group to embarrass her. 

She did not like that I asked her to bring something different and said that if I had a problem with it, I should bring something else or leave for lunch, since it wasn’t her problem. I told her that it’s inconsiderate to others when we’re all on a tight schedule and just want to enjoy the break we have and eat. Amanda  jumped in to say that she didn’t mind and she knew other people who didn’t either, so I was just being a jerk. 

I let it go, but this morning I woke up to an email from my boss (and HR) regarding the issue urging me to apologize for my “inconsiderate” (HR speak for asshole) requests and comments to a coworker. 

I didn’t feel that I was the asshole in this situation but now that HR and my boss have brought it up, I’m wondering if I really am an asshole.",0
"This was an all time low for me, as usually I'm the problem solver. I shouldn't have said it but was I wrong in saying it? 

My husband and I both grew up in foster care and developed two completely different attitudes due to it. I'm humble, problem solving, generally positive and a glass half full type of women. He is a ""life is out to get me"", ""it will never get better"", glass half empty type of man. Not always! Please don't take this as me bashing him. He HAS gotten better with the help he gets in therapy but those moments where he collapses and goes back to his negativity is hard. He has a lot of good days now and things have been getting better but recently he had a personality shift again. 

Now.. back about a year ago he got himself a dog. Her name is Josie and she is a Heeler/Dashaund (I didn't spell that right, sorry). I wasn't exactly in on this decision but I wasn't surprised because he impulse buys/spends and generally doesn't think before acting when it comes to these impulses. Again, he's gotten better but it's still there. He wanted a dog in foster care and couldn't have one so now he has one. That's how he's seeing it. He didn't take in to consideration her breed or temperament. She has a high prey drive and is nippy, even with us sometimes. We have bent backwards trying to train her but nothing appears to work. And now.. due to her prey drive.. we are having a hard time being accepted in to any other apartment/house and we are on the verge of eviction after a steep increase in rent ($550 increase so now we are paying $1600 for a 1 bedroom, nothing included). In the first month of him getting Josie, I begged him to re-home her. My foster mom was a dog trainer and I know a thing or two about training and temperaments and I knew that given Josie's breed we were going to have troubles. He didn't listen, because he didn't want to abandon the dog just like he had been abandoned. And now, due to this, we can't find another place to live and we are slowly going completely broke paying rent here. We only have $26 to last us until next week and do not have rent money for next month. 

He started complaining real heavy yesterday and I will admit my tone and attitude was unlike me. He was saying he is sick of living in poverty and was tired of never having money and I have heard this far too many times. So I told him we live in poverty because he made the poor choice of getting an aggressive dog with a high prey drive and refusing to re-home her because of his abandonment issues. We had a place lined up months ago, who backed out due to the dog. Everyone else says we cannot bring the dog. We can't afford the other ones. He says I'm an AH for making him feel like shit for refusing to re-home his dog. Im admittedly feeling pretty shitty for even saying it but am I wrong?",0
"Throwaway Account

I (25m) am having a clash of morals and obligations and would like an outside perspective. When I was 13 my parents died and I was raised by my paternal grandparents. It was the easiest choice since they lived in the same area when my parents were alive and visited them frequently. I am my grandparents only grandchild as my aunt (43f) is child free so when they passed on they left me their house. The current total value of the house is around $500,000 and that's lowballing the estimate and it's fully paid off so I basically have a really good head start in life although I could never imagine selling it.

Recently, I was approached by a man (38m), ""John,"" claiming to be my grandfather's son and would like a DNA test to verify it. I shocked and didn't believe him and told him to f off because that would mean that my grandfather cheated on my grandmother. He also contacted my aunt and she recognized him as the neighbor's kid who moved away years ago. Apparently my grandparents were friends with his parents but then one day there was a huge fight and the couple moved away.

John stated that his mom had an affair with my grandfather and when the husband found out he divorced his mom and they were forced to sell the house. John said that his mom's husband wanted nothing to do with him since he wasn't sure if he was the father and abandoned him. Years later John tracked him down and after a DNA test was confirmed that he wasn't the father, John's mom confessed that the only other possible candidate was my grandfather. John's mom insisted her ex was the father for years.

My aunt lives in another country so John has been asking me to do a DNA test so that he can finally know for sure who his father is. I was willing to do it until my girlfriend (26f) brought up the issue of ownership of the house. I did a quick check and if the DNA test proves that John is indeed my grandfather's son he might be able to sue for a share of the estate. If it came down to it I would be forced to sell my home because there's no way I could buy out even 1/3 of the share if John wanted it.

I contacted John and said that I would be more than willing to do a DNA test but only under the condition that he sign away any rights or claims to the house if he's proven to be my grandfather's son via paperwork that my lawyer(s) will draw up. I didn't hear from John for days but then got an angry call from a woman claiming to be his wife who called me greedy and selfish. That I couldn't possibly know that pain of not knowing who my father is and that my grandfather owes John. I hung up on her and contacted a lawyer so far unless John can present enough evidence to create doubt he doesn't have much of a case, especially since the possible father is already deceased.

While I'm content with never giving John what he wants until he waives his rights, and my aunt won’t either, his wife has begun stalking me on social media and putting me on blast. AITA?  


ETA: Just in case this wasn't clear and to give more info

1. My aunt is aware of everything is supports what I'm doing.
2. My grandparents will was very clear once the both passed I get the house, my aunt got their Life Insurance policy, we split the remainder of their savings, and sentimental items were to be given to the designated people. There was NO mention of giving anything for a possible secret long lost child.
3. My grandparents were cremated so John wouldn't be able to even request that my grandfather be dug up for a test. Although, my aunt and I haven't told him that.
4. I did initially block his wife but she created other accounts.
5. I'm an American and live in the U.S.A.   ",0
"This happened a few months ago but recently I wondered about it. I (25F if it's relevant) lost my brother in traumatic circumstances (to which I was a witness) about a year ago, and this incident occurred about a week later. I mentioned it to a friend last week, and my friend said ""wow, grief really does make people act like assholes,"" and it made me wonder if I really had been a complete asshole in this situation. 

It happened about a week after my brother died. I was on the bus, and I must have had a bit of a case of resting bitch face because the guy next to me tapped me on the shoulder, waited for me to remove my earphones, and told me to ""smile, love, it might never happen."" I fully admit here that I can be quite a lairy person for a 5ft 2 woman, and if I think someone's out of order I don't really have many qualms about telling them, so I replied ""it already has happened, hence the lack of smile, but thanks for the suggestion,"" and made to put my earphones back in. He then said something like ""it can't be that bad, chin up, look on the bright side,"" and at that point I really did just want to be left alone, so I said ""I don't know, do you count watching your brother die horribly as 'that bad'?"" and that finally made him stop talking.

Now, I'm very aware that there is literally no way this guy could have known why exactly I looked so glum, because he's not a mind reader. He wasn't psychic and he didn't know that I had literally watched my brother die pretty horribly a week before. However, I absolutely resent being told to smile, especially by men I've never met. I really don't feel like he would have told a 6ft 4 man to 'smile, it might never happen,' for example. I feel like he was being demeaning and didn't actually have concerns about my state of mind, he just wanted to make me feel uncomfortable and point out that he'd rather see a woman smile than frown. He didn't ask me what was wrong, which I feel like he would have done if he'd actually been concerned, he just told me to smile. I also really feel like we never know exactly what's going on in people's lives, so telling someone that it 'can't be that bad' is just completely facile when you have no idea how bad it might be. 

My friend said I should have just played along and smiled or ignored him, but honestly that would have made me feel more uncomfortable. I will fully accept if I'm judged TA here, however! AITA for snapping at him?",0
"My niece suggested I post here.

My ex and I have 2 kids b/g twins aged 9.  We split in 2017.  She cheated and fell in love with someone else.  I exposed the OM to his wife and blew up his marriage.  I filed for divorce and never looked back.  We had some disagreements over child custody but settled on 50/50 custody.  I knew it would not work because the ex worked so much and traveled extensively for her job.  The ex kept saying she would be able to do 50/50 and during our divorce stopped traveling for her job and put on a good show but it did not last.

Right after the divorce was finalized she started traveling again and was only getting the kids 4 days a month.  Maybe 6 days but that was rare.  She never had them for a full 14 days per month after the divorce.  I documented everything and kept meticulous records of her missed parenting time.  It was so hard to plan anything because I did not always know when the kids would be with me during her parenting time.  I did not want our life to revolve around her job.  After 1 year I filed for physical custody.  The ex fought and she lost.  I don't want to say it was a slam dunk but she did not give her lawyer much to work with.  She dragged it out and we had a whole custody evaluation and custody trial.  There is a very detailed visitation schedule.  Also if she is more than 30 minutes late her visitation is forfeited.

Even after our second round in court I still tried to be flexible because I wanted her to spend as much time with the kids as possible but she still did not make them a priority.  She was still late or returned them early.  I got fed up and started following the custody agreement to the letter.  I refused to switch weekends with her and started enforcing the late clause.  On four different occasions, I refused to let her take the kids because she was late as in now showing up until the next day.

She started telling her family that I was denying her visitation.  Her parents and siblings actually showed up at my door.  I told them to stop acting like she was a good mother who was being deprived of her kids.  We had this whole custody evaluation done and the report was terrible regarding ex wife.  The evaluator was not impressed with her at all.  I gave them the report to read and told them to gtfo my property.  They read it.  I know this because the ex called me screaming like a banshee because I exposed her lies and was called out by them.  She said this was a private matter.  I told her I would share the report with anyone she told lies too and I hung up.   Her parents did apologize and her brother sort of did.  Her sister on the other hand tells me I am an asshole for not letting her see the kids if she is late.  I told her I have the kids in therapy because of her neglect and that shut her up.

So AITA?  I think I might be the asshole because I showed her family the custody evaluator's report and maybe I could have proved my point in a different way.

Edit:  This has been brought up several times and will address it here.  The twins see the ex inlaws every Wednesday and the occasional weekend.  They also vacation with them in the summer.  I do not prevent contact.",0
"Edit one: many questions has been asked if we're full or half-siblings. I can confirm we're full siblings. 

I (24F) am due to get married in two weeks to the love of my life (38F). I have two sisters ""A"" (29F) and ""B"" (26F) and a former friend ""Dick"" (24M). 

Dick and I go a long way back and used to be great friends but a few years ago there was drama starting in our friendship group and everyone started turning on each other. At the time our mother was poorly and I knew she was reaching the end of her days so I was saving money in cash otherwise I would have spent it if it was in a debit card or credit card to pay for her funeral expenses as she didn't have a will in place or a funeral plan, she was too far gone mentally as well to sort that out. 

I saved about £3,500.00 for my mum's funeral. But Dick stole that money which I reported was stolen I told them I knew it was Dick but didn't have the evidence. A few days later my mother passed away. I ended up having to get a loan out for £5,000.00 and ended up getting into debt for it. A few days after my mum had died Dick had showed up to my door. He openly admitted to stealing the money and was laughing at the fact my mum died. 

A and B knew what was going on. A year later I found out B was friends with him, not just ""friends"" but ""BEST FRIENDS"" with him even after knowing what he did. I decided not to speak to them for a few months as I needed time. 

In two weeks, I'll be getting married and I found out during a family dinner yesterday that B is bringing Dick as her plus one. When we announced our engagement I did say she could bring anyone as I didn't think she bring Dick at all. I went ballistic and told B that Dick isn't coming to the wedding and he ain't going to be your plus one and if you don't accept that then it means you're uninvited to the wedding as well. My fiancè remained calm but voiced her opinion and said she agreed. 

A got involved and a screaming match went off. A said if B is uninvited to the wedding then they're not coming as well. ""They're"" being my BIL and sister. My BIL stayed out of it and told me he's still coming as well. 

Some of my friends think I'm being an asshole because I lost my mother and I only have my sisters left and my strict stance will ruin the relationship for good if I don't allow Dick to come.

"
My wife and I have been together for 3yr. I have a daughter from my previous marriage. She's 14. I also have a stepson who tends to be rude at times but civil enough around adults. He's 16. He and his step sister get along well. No arguing, no yelling even better than most siblings I know which is great and it's quite a relief to see them loving and respecting each other.

We have two bathrooms in the house. My daughter only uses the smaller one. Since it's always available unlike the main bathroom that me, my stepson and wife often use.

I've recently received some money and decided to renovate the small bathroom that my daughter uses since she complained about things needing to be fixed. I started the renovation 2 days ago. While my daughter uses the main bathroom as an alternative. There were no issues until my wife pulled me aside saying my daughter's been leaving period products inside the bathroom and it wasn't right cause my stepson would see them. I asked my wife for more clarification and turns out my daughter gets rid of her used pads by putting them in the trashcan inside the bathroom. I told my wife there was nothing wrong with that so what's the problem. She gave me a look. Called me an ignorant then dropped it.

This morning she looked upset and told me my stepson went inside the bathroom after my daughter got out and probably saw her used pads in the bathroom. I asked if she meant the trashcan and it was confirmed. She then proceeded to tell me to ask my daughter to stop using the main bathroom even though the small one is still in the process of being renovated. I absolutely lost my shit and told her she was making a ridiculously unreasonable demand. Told her it's my daughter's house too. Where is she supposed to go if she can't use both bathrooms?. We started arguing back and forth until she said she'd talk to her but I told her to stop it. She just kept giving me the cold shoulder for hours now even though my stepson said nothing about this ""issue"" as she claims it to be.

My wife said she was trying to be a parent but I treat her as an outsider to my daughter. That's not true. I might've been harsh on her but in my opinion she wasn't trying to parent she was being unreasonable. I might be wrong I just don't see her point.

AMITA Here!?

My wife is an incredibly private person but that doesn't mean she can get others to follow.

To answer your question: The trashcan we have has a lid. It's a step on trashcan that doesn't require hands.

"I, 39m, work in agriculture. Long days, long hours, great money. We recently hired a new guy. He's 35ish. He told us early on that he is not a morning person and, boy, was he right.

We show up at 6am and for the first hour or so, this guy is just a huuuuge pain in the balls. He whines about being tired, he whines about the long hours, he whines about the dust, smells, bugs, grease, chemicals, equipment and pretty much everything else that was explained to him when he was hired. This is the job.

He does this every morning without fail. But after the first hour, a switch flips and he is a reasonably capable and competent employee. No bitching or crying for the rest of the day and we all get along fine. We more or less like the guy. Just not for the first hour of the day. Every. Day. For months.

About a week ago, he turns up in the morning and is on a tear. Just ranting. We all go along with our day, but this morning is worse than others. It just. Keeps. Going. He's unstoppable. Until I finally tell him, ""OK man... I have heard enough. Close your mouth, buckle down, find something else to do AWAY FROM US. Or quit. I don't know. But I am tired of hearing your shit.""

Guy goes ballistic. ""So run me off! Fire me! Whip my ass!"" No, dude. No one wants that. We all have a job to do and families to feed. Just shut up. He does not. He escalates his fit until he is literally taunting me and the rest of our crew because no one has the courage to thrash him. Uh... because we are professionals? But I, for one, was approaching that line.

He finally walks away for half an hour, comes back in better humor, and apologizes. I accept his apology. Then he just stands there. Waiting expectantly. For what? Me to apologize.

No sir. Your attitude is a problem. If the first 2 hours of your day are miserable, it is your responsibility to wake up earlier and get it out of your system before work hours. Stuff your hissy fit up your ass. Call your mom, maybe, because no one else cares.

So he calls the big boss. Who promptly fires him, chews my ass for antagonizing the goober, and has a bad day of his own.

So. Am I the asshole? I am feeling slightly guilty, as the guy has kids and a mortgage just like me. But I also feel fine with it, as dude is a crybaby. Despite his warning about bad mornings, where does my duty to take shit and abuse off this asshole end?",0

Her parents did help out a bit at first but I haven’t spoken to the in last decade. I was financially stable when my kids were younger. My ex wife also worked, so money wasn’t a problem for my boys. Money wasn’t a problem when I was a single father either earlier on. I made good money for my daughter up until three years ago. I got hit by a car and I still experience physical trauma from it. I can barely walk and have immense back pain. I’m on disabilities and can barely work. I can no longer afford to send my kid to college without her having to take loans. I brought this up to her and she has told me that it’s extremely unfair because her brothers were able to go to college without any loans. I have asked my sons to help with her school but they’ve refused as well. AITA

Edit: I just wanted to add some details. One of my son can’t afford to help out because him and his wife are about to start a family and all of his extra money is going towards fertility treatment. I wasn’t aware of this before asking. My other son said it isn’t fair if he pays but the first son doesn’t pay and basically “what if my wife needs fertility treatment or I get hit by a car?” 

I think I may be the asshole because my daughter thinks I can downsize my life style to be able to pay for her college such as selling my car since I don’t need to go to work, or selling my home and living in an apartment/smaller home or cancelling things like Netflix, internet etc. I refuse to do either. I don’t think I have to suffer any further. I am wifeless and crippled for life. Is it wrong that I want to be able to drive to get my groceries and for PT? Or that I want to have high speed internet and Netflix?

I can also pay for about 2 years of college for her. I have 20k saved for her college funds. I had about double for each boy

Edit: Thank you for all your comments and advice. There’s some misunderstandings in the comments that I’ll like to clear.

1) All my children have lost their mother. Not just my daughter. My sons lost her at age SIX. They didn’t have an easy childhood either. So the idea that they had a picture perfect life while my daughter has some crappy life is incorrect. The first few years without mom was difficult for them that I I put them in counselling. My daughter didn’t remember her mom but when she was old enough, she was also placed in counselling. 

2) My daughter isn’t my care taker. I’m not so disabled that I need a care taker. I am able to drive, buy groceries, shower, cook and do basic things. My sister or sons come over when it’s stuff l that I can’t do like mowing the lawn. My daughter does basic chores like dishes, vacuuming.",0
"Just to be clear, I got married in early February. 

I have always been very close to my father and stepmom growing up. I always felt like they offered me a stable home for me to grow up in. I never had that with my mother. During the last few years of my parents' marriage, my mother changed as a person. She was a happy and cheerful person when we were younger. She really changed after the divorce. She was miserable, and I felt that. I could tell that she hated the fact that I preferred to live with my dad, but never verbalized her feelings.

She has been single since the divorce, and refuses to date other people. I always wanted to have joint birthday parties with my mom, dad and stepmom, but my mom wouldn't have it. She avoided my father like the plague. I never understood her behavior and resented her for it.

Quite naturally, I preferred my dad's household over my mom's. Anyways, right before my wedding, I was staying at my dad's.

One night, I overheard my dad and stepmom reminiscing about how they met. Now they always told us that they met 6 months after the divorce at a library. Turns out, they lied.

They were talking about how my father couldn't take his eyes off her the moment she walked into his office and how he wanted her from that moment on, and how he didn't care that he had a pregnant wife at home.

Apparently their first kiss was a few days after I was born, and the first time they had sex was on my parents' 3rd anniversary. I was only a few months old back then. They were talking about how difficult it was for them to continue their relationship after they got caught when I was 5. This was extremely shocking to me because my parents got divorced when I was 10. They were also making fun of my mom's weight.

This meant that they carried on an affair throughout my parents' marriage. I remember my mom changing for the worse when I was in second grade.

My mom always knew and she never told me. I broke down crying that night and I felt really guilty because of the way I acted towards my mom growing up. I had no idea she went through so much. I was cheated on by my first boyfriend in college and it destroyed me. I felt horrible.

 That night, I didn't confront my dad but the next morning, I packed my shit up and transferred the amount he had spent on my wedding. I didn't want his money. I told him I heard every thing and asked him to stay away from my wedding.

I left their house and drove to my mom's. I hugged her really hard and we both cried.

I had my mom walk me down the aisle, and I made sure my dad's family didn't attend the wedding. I didn't explicitly disinvite my half brother, but he stayed away from my wedding and I'm actually glad be didn't come.

I don't think I want anything to do with any of them anymore.

I've heard from the grapevine that my dad is on anti depressants nowadays. My grandma blames me for his depression. 

Did I overreact? I still don't want anything to do with him. My dad's family think I was and I am being cruel to him. 

AITA?

"I am Brazilian, but I've been living in the US for 3 years. My first language is Brazilian Portuguese.

I have a 4yo son, and I'm pregnant with a girl due in May. My son is friends with a girl whose mother (I'll call her Becca) is also pregnant. She's due a couple weeks before me, and is also expecting a (3rd) girl. Since we take our kids on playdates almost weekly, we frequently talk about our pregnancies.

Becca is into unique names. Not ""Yooneeks"" or ""Tragedeighs"", but names that she and her husband create. It's not my style, but she managed to come up with genuinely nice names both her older daughters, so there was never really a reason for me to say anything.

This time, Becca and her husband had a lot of trouble coming up with a new name. She first brought this up last December. For months, they'd try to create something that sounded good, with no success.

We took our kids on a playdate at a park this weekend. When we sat down for a snack, Becca excitedly told me they'd finally settled on a name. I was really happy for her, and asked what they'd chosen.

*Narina*. To those who don't know, that's Portuguese for ""nostril.""

I managed to control myself, and told her it sounded lovely. But my son let out a giggle (my husband and I are raising him bilingual, so he speaks Portuguese), and Becca wanted to know why. I tried to brush it off, but she kept insisting. Eventually, I told her that while Narina *could* be a lovely name, it was also the Portuguese word for ""nostril.""

Becca seemed really sad to hear that. She said she'd think of something else, but had fallen in love with Narina.

After we went home, Becca's husband called me. He was furious at me for ruining the only name they had agreed on. Apparently, he had a fight with Becca because she told him she wanted to think of something else. He argued they'd ""never visit Brazil anyway"", so they shouldn't have to change the name, but Becca refused to use Narina.

My husband agrees that their fight is not my fault, but thinks I didn't need to tell Becca anything, since Americans are unlikely to know what Narina means.

AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: This was not my son's fault. He is 4 years old and had an honest reaction to hearing a baby would essentially be named ""Nostril."" I get that some people might think I was the AH, but don't blame my child for this.

EDIT 2: Okay, a lot of people are misreading ""Narina"" as ""Narnia."" No real comment on that, but ""The Chronicles of Nostril"" has a nice ring to it.",0
"I love my brother, and i want to stress he is a good guy, a good dad, but self-absorbed, focused on his kids to the exclusion of everything else and hopeless financially. If there's money in his bank account, he spends it like water. I'm the opposite, in that I save and invest and spend within my means.

Any woman he hooks up with, he ends up supporting, and when he runs out of funds and he comes begging me for help.

About 10 years ago we purchased a house together 50/50 (mainly so i could help him get on property ladder and stabilise his living situation and as it worked out cheaper for me as i had to keep loaning/giving money for rent).  So far, I have paid off 2 previous women who assumed my brother was rolling in it. They got disappointed and then put their hands out for large amounts of cash.

Now he's separated from baby mumma of his 2 kids, who openly admits she only had babies with him because he had (she thought loads of) money.

12 months of back and forth legal with $100k of lawyer fees, and everything's been settled.  She gets 70% of his assets, and he has to pay his lawyer fees out of his remaining 30%. He has to sell his share of the house to be able to pay her and the legal fees. He has literally no other assets and has never had any savings.

I have said that I will purchase his share of the house at current market value, and he and the kids can live in the house for a fixed (low) rent until the kids are 25. 

My brother wants me to give him the cash to pay her out and pay the legal fees without selling me his share of the property based on the fact the property will keep going up in value and I'll eventually get my money back (in 20 yrs when i am 68-70). 

I can just about do this financially, but it's my entire life savings plus a new mortgage for the remaining funds and it means I can't retire and will have to continue working the next 12 years until I'm in my 60's.

I can't walk away from my very young nephews, and he knows this. Morally, I just can't. So please don't make this suggestion. Kids in my family are everything and loved and protected, even from their parents' stupidity, financial or otherwise.

Yet, im tired. Of being the financial fallback for a brother who never offers to help me in any way. Who at 48 treats money like water. It's safer for me, for the kids, if the property is in my name and his future relationships don't have a claim on it.

He and my older brother are calling me heartless and think I should just finance everything and keep the property in both our names.

AITAH for standing firm about only giving him the money if he sells me his share of the property. 

I feel awful, but i can't think of another way to protect him, the kids and me from his future dumb ass financial and relationship decisions.",0
"I just found a new job, closer to home for more pay, and put in my notice. The people here are acting like they'll miss me but it's such a great opportunity that most of them are understanding and kind about it. 

The issue I have is...I paid for nearly everything in our coffee break area out of my own pocket. The keurig, all the coffee pods, sugar, creamer...I paid for it it's mine.

However it is the only working coffee pot in the building, and when joked to my store manager about, ""What are you going to do without your morning coffee?"" Now my current coworkers are saying, ""are you really going to steal the coffee pot when you leave?""

It's not stealing, it's mine. And it's not cheap to replace. So internet strangers...WIBTA for taking home my Keurig and coffees?

Edit: the FM (manager I made the joke to) got her coffee this morning and said Snarky Coworker had gone to the SM, and gave me the credit card and company car to go buy a new keurig, said keep the new one and the office can have the old one.

"  
I (26F) have a sister, Brenda (29F) who has 6 children with her husband, her oldest 2 are in the same middle school, they’re Melvin (12M) and Jensen (11M).   
  
They go to a private middle school and in our state there are no curriculum requirements for private schools. Jensen and his friends from his basketball team all took as many sports related classes as they could to avoid more academic classes, one of those classes Jensen and his friends are in is Dance 1. The class is mixed gender, but the class Jensen and his friends are in is mostly male, however, there are only a few males in the class not in his basketball friend group.  
  
One of these boys is named Liam (11M). I have met Liam a few times before as he will be at my sister’s house with Jensen and the rest of his friends when we go over there for dinner. Liam is a good kid, he’s very sweet and respectful. Liam is also on the more feminine side, liking more traditionally “girly” things like the Stanley tumbler, dance, skincare, and being a Swiftie. Brenda and her husband are fine with this, say they don’t care what he likes.  
  
The issue is Melvin. Melvin and his friends have bullied Liam both at home and at school, calling him the f slur, calling him gay and “zesty”. Melvin and his friends have gotten detention and suspension for their homophobia and misogyny multiple times before.  
  
The issue is Brenda and her husband dismiss this and don’t punish Melvin because he’s autistic, and a very nerdy/geeky kid. They say stuff like “Melvin and his friends just don’t understand, they shouldn’t be punished for a lack of social skills.” They have said that autistic boys will just naturally be “edgy”, and how all the parents of boys in autism parents Facebook groups report their sons having similar issues.  
  
I’m neurotypical but am getting my Master’s in Disability Studies, on Friday, I was at Brenda’s house and Melvin made a homophobic comment to Liam, then Jensen told him to “shut the f\*\*k up”. Brenda told Jensen to “be respectful to Melvin, you know he’s different”, I asked Brenda if I could speak with her in private.  
  
I told her I was concerned about Melvin and how I felt that she was using his autism to dismiss his behavior and how that was harmful, I mentioned what I have learned in my classes. She said that I should stop “talking over Melvin” and that as a Disability Studies student I should know “not to be a neurotypical speaking over an autistic kid”. She said I was “talking over” my nephew and how Melvin has told her that autistic culture is about embracing his differences and how he just “speaks the truth”, I decided to stop pushing back after she called me ableist.  
  
A bit after I got home, she texted me asking for an apology for “speaking over” Melvin, I said I would think about it because I didn’t think I did much wrong. Since then, her and Melvin have been saying that I was causing harm to him and I should apologize.

"I (17F) just finished opening presents with my family. We opened presents from my grandparents, aunt, and uncle today b/c they will not be with us on Christmas day. And I only got 2 presents from my grandparents, which included a hat with cat ears, and a bracelet. I love the bracelet, but I really don't like the hat... I live in a city where it does snow in the winter and can get very cold.  But I am 17, and I don't like wearing hats with cat ears like when I was 10. I still smiled and said thank you and told them that I loved it. Then when I see all the things they get for my mom,dad, aunt and uncle. 

I made me feel a bit jealous, because they get my parents etc. nice things, and things that they maybe have mentioned not having, and then they go and get me things that a 10 yr old would want. I feel like I am a super easy person to shop for, I love art, and am super into making jewelry and photography. I know I should be grateful that I even got anything, but I cant help feeling like they didn't put much thought into the gift, and was more of a last minute gift.

"I (24f) live at home with my mum (49f, single mum) and sister (30f). Rent and bills are split 3 ways between all of us at approx £380 per person monthly in a housing association. 

My mum studied interior design at Uni and throughout my childhood till now (and ongoing) likes to obsessively change something in the house every year or few months (depending on the size of the project). 

Since 2019 my mum has been out of work a total of nearly 4 years (2 from 2019 and 2020, worked in a contract role 2021 and 2022 and has been out of work since). Before she finished her contract role I advised her to start looking for employment 3 months before it ends, she made excuses and mentioned waiting as they may offer her permanent or another role. She later confessed she didn’t want to work for anyone and wants to do her own thing. 

During the time she has been off she has busied her time with taking on home projects such as redecorating the hallways/foyer, kitchen, garden, front garden and most recently the bathroom. Which we have all paid for and split by three. 

She has since mentioned re-carpeting the stairs as the company which we purchased from installed it with the wrong nails we often prick our feet on the stairs (this is something I had mentioned at the time as I saw the man doing the stairs and she got annoyed at me for “causing a fuss”.) 

We all do our own food shopping and she eats our food (snacks etc) often and claims she thought it was hers, my sister would then mention she told her and my mum will deny and not replace the item she had taken. There have been times when she fills up the fridge/freezer or both with her food items and my sister and I will have to buy takeaways until there is space to do our weekly shop or she will mention how disgusting she thinks your food is that I’ll end up eating in my room or eating something else. 

On top of all of this she swears and calls us names  e.g. she noticed the stairs light was off when she was going to bed and thought one of us had done it “not caring about her” and that we were being “pathetic”,”stupid”and “selfish”. 

My sister now wants to move out and live with her boyfriend in 6months time, I’m worried to live with her by myself and have to deal with all of this whilst I save to buy and try to achieve other goals.

"I  was cooking with my partner (Jay) in the room, and I asked Jay where something was for the recipe. Looking in the fridge I couldn't see it for the longest time until I finally did and I made a 'derp' sound while laughing, making fun of my own inability to see the product that was quite literally right in front of my face. 

My partner said ""excuse me?"" but I was still excited and cooking and I didn't realise their seriousness until Jay asked me ""You know why I said excuse me? Because that's ableist."" I asked to clarify and they meant the derp noise I made.  

I've been looking it up online but every article goes on about saying 'derp' to a disabled person to mock them, which doesn't fit the situation. I'd see how that'd be ableist, but mocking myself doesn't really fit the bill, yet I feel horrible because my partner is often a beacon of good morals and ethics and I respect them so it really shook me.

"My M27 fiancèe F25 has an obvious permanent burnscar from an accident that caused her mother (her only parent) to pass away from injury. My fiancèe had a long recovery it's been 7 years. The scar is on her collarbone. it goes down her chest but isn't showing. Unless she's wearing scoop/square tops. She often wears hoodies/jackets to cover up. She puts this cream I don't know what ladies call it but it's supposed to tone skin color or something? I'm not sure but my fiancèe calls it foundation that is one degree brighter than her skin color. I absolutely adore her she's pretty, smart, ambitious and the list goes on. What happened was unfortunate and I'm glad she's at peace with herself and more confident.

My family love her. How can they not. She's a member of the family. My mom makes sure she takes part in every family function and things like shopping and decorating other things. However. My sister made comments about my fiancèe's scar several times. I've called her out on her behavior several times to get her to stop because she was hurting me before my fiancèe with her backhanded and insensitive
comments. I told my fiancèe she had everyright to cut my sister out and not deal with her bullshit but she has been forgiving and respectful of my entire family.

Our wedding is in February. My fiancèe went shopping for the wedding dress. This is where the issue started:

My fiancèe showed the wedding dress to my sister. I didn't see it but I was told it was a spaghetti strap dress. My fiancèe likes this stuff. Anyways my sister saw it and went nuts she started criticising her choice and said that she should've gotten a high nick or a jewel wedding dress to cover up the scar. She argued with my fiancèe about it. I went to my family's house and I confronted her. I yelled at her after she told me my fiancee needed to return the dress and get a ""proper"" one so that guests won't focus on her burnscar and use it as the topic of conversation and gossip. I told her that she's not invited to our wedding. She isn't welcome to my wedding with this entitled attitude of hers and her insensitivity and disrespect. We argued for half an hour then I left.

In exactly an hour. My mom and dad called and berated me saying my sister was crying after I uninvited her and that I had no right to univinte her. She's my sister and was just trying to help out and give an advice and avoid any ""unnecessary"" drama at the wedding. My mom said my fiancèe can keep the dress but suggested to wear a pridel shawl as a neutral solution. I stopped responding to my mom's calls and texts after that. Family members were upset my sister was uninvited and wanted me to invite her again because this will make family look bad in front of outsiders and guests.",0

I (16M) have two brothers, Baxter (13M) and Spiro (12M). Both of my brothers run ""fanpages"" on Instagram and TikTok, where they post edits of stuff. Baxter posts edits of lacrosse players he likes and other lacrosse related things, it's a fairly normal fanpage. Spiro runs a Star Wars fanpage, where he obvi posts about Star Wars. The issue is what I have seen him say in comments and in private chats.   
  
The first problem I saw was that Spiro had used the n word in comments on other people's videos, and when pressured about it, he lied about our race. He said he was Black, he is white, everyone in his family is white and all of his friends are white. I saw this and went to his room to ask him about it, he said that he had a friend give him ""the n-word pass"", but wehn I asked which friend, he admitted it was a lie. I told our parents about this and they said he was just being a ""dumb kid"".  
  
In the past few months, I have seen Spiro to continue to make comments that are sexist, homophobic, ect and just nasty in general. I have also read over his shoulder and know he is doing the same in private group chats.  
  
Last night, Spiro asked me to promote his account to some of my friends as he wanted more followers. I told him no and he got mad at me because I promoted Baxter's even though I don't like lacrosse. I told him that maybe if he wasn't such a jerk on there I'd promote it. He started to yell at me and I told him he was acting like a loser.   
  
He went downstairs to our mom and dad, and I explained my side of the story. They said I should apologize for ""bullting Spiro"", when Baxter heard about this, he sided with me and my family started to argue even more. I still have not apologized and don't plan to. AITA?

" I DID NOT BRING THIS UP but when “what makes someone good in bed” came up in conversation, my boyfriend asked me point-blank if I think he’s good in bed, and I said no. He’s angry because it’s not his fault I don’t get off, which is true. I can’t get off just from PIV sex, and he doesn’t like the things that do get me off (oral, kissing, foreplay). 

I’ve told him twice now, politely, that I’m unsatisfied and I’d like him to do x, y, and z to fix that (initiate, show some passion/lust, occasionally offer to do the things that might help me get off, like play with me with a toy). He agrees he knows how to please me, he just doesn’t make the effort because he doesn’t get anything out of it. So I said “well yeah that’s literally the definition of ‘bad in bed’”. He got angry and said it’s my job to “make” him do those things. I said “well I can’t enjoy it if I have to force you, that’s not sexy at all” and he got huffy and left. 

Obviously I’m very grateful that he’s wants to sleep with me at all (I dated my last boyfriend for five years and he really only wanted it once every month or two), but I don’t think that that alone makes someone “good in bed”. I put a ton of effort into my appearance/fitness, I show initiative and enjoyment in our sex life, I compliment him and make him feel sexy…he does none of those things. Otherwise our relationship is good though, so of course I’d never tank it over this. Was I supposed to just lie to my boyfriend? Am I the asshole here?",0
"
My husband and I live in a two-bedroom apartment. One bedroom serves as an office with a day bed, where he keeps all his clothes. The Master Bedroom is where we sleep, and I have all my clothes there, along with my vanity for doing hair and makeup.

He’s an extremely light sleeper; anything wakes him up, even if I just shift in bed. He struggles with insomnia and has a hard time sleeping.

I usually work from home, but occasionally I go to the office for social events because it’s part of my evaluation as a new hire. I go into the office around twice a month.

I usually let him know the day before when I’m going into the office, but every time I wake up early to go, he gives me a hard time about it. It’s really starting to weigh me down because I feel like I can’t wake up as early as I want to, afraid I’ll disturb him. So I end up lying in bed until around 7 AM before getting up to get ready. I have to be at the office by 8:30 AM. It takes me about 30-40 minutes to get ready, and the office is about 25-30 minutes away from where we live.

This morning, when I woke up, I tried to be quiet while getting my makeup and hair products from our bedroom cause I was planning to get ready in the bathroom so he doesn’t wake up, but he still woke up and complained. He’s passive-aggressive, and since he was already up and bothering me while I tried to be as quiet as possible, I thought, why bother trying? He’s going to give me a hard time anyway, and all my clothes are in that room. I gave him an eye mask to put on and continued getting ready for work, but it feels like I’m being held back.

He also works from home but goes to the office twice a week. He still wakes me up sometimes, but I don’t complain; I’m very understanding. Sometimes I even wake up to help him when he’s running late, even though I don’t have to wake up. He claims he doesn’t wake me up because he goes to the other room to get ready (where his stuff is), but he still goes into our bedroom to get his hair done and turns on the light. He says I need to move all my stuff the night before I go to the office and called me “pathetic” for comparing our situations, even trying to compare me to someone with mental issues, all because I unintentionally woke him up while trying to get ready for work.

He is a great person and I love him till death, but I am not a fan of his behaviors in this situation.

Am I the asshole for asking him to suck it up, since I only go to the office twice a month? It’s not like I wake him up at 5 AM every day. I literally get out of bed at 7 AM, and not to mention, I have to rush to get to work on time because I can’t wake up as early as I want to. He complains about the noises I make when I wake up, but falls asleep while the TV is on. 

Additionally: he turns the TV on our bedroom on and sometime falls asleep without turning it off, I cannot sleep with TV on and when I try to take the remote controller to turn it off he jumps out of bed and complains that A. He’s still watching. B. I woke him up.

"I (22 F) and my friend of many years (also 22 F) got tickets to see a comedy show happening in our city. This was special to us and we were very excited about it because the comedian we were going to see had been a mutual favourite for a long time and we loved to watch their stuff together. 

But by the time the day of the show came, I was very sick with a head cold. I had a bad cough and my sinuses were all messed up. I told her that I wasn't sure I would be able to go because I felt like it was irresponsible to go to a public space while probably oozing germs everywhere. 

She pressured me into going anyway. I acknowledge that I played a part in this decision and it was irresponsible of me to go out into public while feeling so sick.

  
When packing for the show I brought this nasal spray that I had gotten a couple of days prior that had been helping me a lot by clearing my sinuses. At the show, I timed it so that I would use the spray when the opening act finished to maximize my enjoyment of the rest of the night. 

However, this time it felt like someone had taken an icicle and pushed it up and into my brain. It was the most pain I had felt in a long while and it wouldn't go away.

I started getting worried that something serious was going on. I got huge black spots in my vision and my hearing was going in and out. I leaned over to my friend and I told her that I needed to leave because there might be something serious happening to me. She asked if I was positive I wouldn't be able to stay for the rest of the show, and that it would probably end soon. 

I told her I was sorry but that I had to leave and she asked me if I wanted her to come with me. I said that she could if she wanted to but I could also just call an Uber for myself. She said she was gonna stay.

Once I left I actually had to call my girlfriend to order an Uber for me because I couldn't have my eyes open long enough to look at my phone and order it for myself. I go home, sobbing from the pain, take some painkillers and put a hot compress over my eyes.

 After a bit, I felt better enough to text my friend telling her that I got home safe, I was sorry but I hoped she had a good time. 45 minutes later she, to my surprise, starts sending me paragraphs about what a terrible person/friend I am for leaving her there. She said I abandoned her, a young woman, alone at a show in the city by herself at night and something terrible could have happened to her.

She said that I was selfish and that she expected more from me because I always go on about how women should support women. I started crying again and apologized to her and said that I would have stayed if I could but I felt like I couldn't because the pain was too severe. She said she was too angry to talk to me. 

We never spoke again after that and it has been over a year. I have rolled the situation over in my head countless times since but I can't seem to figure out what I could have done differently. AITA?

"My mother is in prison for defrauding the government for 10 plus years, which finally caught with her. About 2 years ago, I was subpoenaed by the court to testify and ended up being the testimonial that ultimately sent her to federal prison. She has been in prison for just over a year now. As a result, we are estranged.

However, I wasn't given much of a choice because my current profession has strict legal requirements that I can't risk bending or I'll lose everything.

Fast forward to this past week; my maternal grandfather passed away suddenly from complications from a stroke he had two months ago. Everyone is sad and devasted, and it's been hard to reconcile the loss during COVID19.

A lot of prisons will grant furlough for those who wish to attend their loved one's funeral—something we already had to do back in February when my grandmother passed away. And I was the one who filled out the paperwork and was 100% responsible for my mother during her furlough. So once I received news of my grandfather's passing, I started on the paperwork but stopped because it turned out that my grandfather is going straight to cremation without a funeral or service, because that is what my grandfather wanted.

And I told my family that we weren't furloughing my mother out because of the fact there is no service or funeral. My family understood.

Fast forward to today, when my sibling calls me to thank me for furloughing our mom out. Shocked and confused, I asked the obvious; what do you mean?

Turns out, as I discovered by calling the prison, that my aunt busted my mother out of prison on FALSIFIED documents where they forged my signature and gave my contact information. And told the prison that there was a funeral and that my mother's presence was required. One; I live in a separate province. Two; THERE ISNT A FUNERAL OR SERVICE - there is absolutely no reason for her to be outside of prison DURING A PANDEMIC. Especially when prisons are COVID19 hotspots.

So I had to call the police because if caught, I could lose my livelihood, my license and a career I love. After all, my mother didn't want to grieve in prison and has zero regards for anyone else's health and wellbeing. I texted everyone in my family to encourage my aunt to my mother back to prison, or I would have no choice but to call the police and charge my aunt with identity theft and have a warrant issued for my mother. Something I --really-- don't want to do.

However, my family is calling me an ""insensitive asshole"" for not allowing the family to get together to grieve, because I ""can't be there and I'm taking it out on them"". So I called my aunt directly, and recorded the call and told her if she didn't return my mother to prison by noon tomorrow, I would call the police and have them issue a warrant for my mother, and have her charged with identity theft.

AITA for not allowing my family for using me to basically prison break my mother?

EDIT: No funeral, I double-checked with g'father's partner

EDIT2: Called Police. Police confirm I will not face legal repercussions as I am a victim

Update: Spoke to my lawyer and asked how it was possible for my aunt to pick up my mother from prison. Turns out, due to the pandemic, visitors are a no-no. In my case, inmates who are furloughed go through all the steps to leave, but the family members are outside waiting. And on a page, I did not see originally, they had my aunt's address as a potential address for my mother to stay, but it was put as a secondary, not as a primary. So I guess the ball was severely dropped, but I won't have definitive answers til I call on Monday.

UPDATE 2: Y'all, please stop assuming my brother is going to prison. He is a lot of things, but he wouldn't help my mother or aunt with this jailbreak. If anything, he is a grief-stricken victim who just wanted to see his mom for the first time since the pandemic and be sad about our grandfather. Who is also currently being an asshole, because he feels I should let them all grieve. It's a fucked up situation, but my brother did nothing illegal. Calm down.

UPDATE 3: My brother is a minor (14 years old) y'all so no, he couldn't furlough our mother out. So please stop asking that. Also, I do not hate my mother. My mother gave me up when I was 11 years old but kept my other siblings and had more, like rehomed me to another family without getting the province involved. She had no parental rights to me, because she signed them away to this family. During that time while I was not in her custody, she continued to gather government benefits claiming I was still with her. Benefits she claimed were beyond your basic child benefits, but other government money she was not entitled to. (I couldn't be as detailed as I wanted to because of the character limit of 3000.) It all came crashing down about 3 years ago when she was arrested for fraud beyond 5 thousand dollars, and then **I was being investigated because of my mother's bs despite the fact I wasn't even aware of any of this.** (context: I reconnected with my grandfather when I was in university and we were very close.) All of my siblings were told to testify, I didn't want to because I didn't want to be involved. I told the prosecution this, so they subpoenaed me. No, I cannot ""plead the fifth"" - that doesn't work here. Secondly, after many conversations I had with my own legal representation at the time, it was best that I testified. So I did. During that time, her violent history was brought up. So y'all keep claiming she is a non violent person is incorrect. She just got caught with a ""non-violent"" crime, which is actually violent because cases like this make it **harder** for people to collect benefits they are entitled to. Not to mention she has a history of fraud that started with my grandmother (her own mother) and my grandfather (who by the way, also testified against her). Trust me, nobody wanted to be involved in sending her to prison. All of this history led to her being sentenced to 5 years, which meant she ended up in federal prison because provincial prison is for sentences of 2 years and under. FEderal is 2 or more years.

I don't even call her ""mom"" anymore - but did so in this post, because of anonymity and simplicity.

Why I bring up COVID19: because we are **actively still living in a pandemic** regardless of whatever stages of reopening we are in. She has not been tested for COVID19, and prisons are currently covid19 hotspots. So yes, I don't want her around my immunocompromised family members, which by the way includes my aunt who is battling breast cancer!! I don't want people to die of covid19 or even have it. She can grieve like everyone else is - at home, but her home just happens to be a prison.

I told all of this to the warden of the prison my mother is at while also on the phone with the detective I spoke to yesterday and my lawyer. Two investigations are now happening; who authorised my mother's furlough at the prison, and my aunt's identity theft (which I'll probably take a restorative justice path to) and whatever else The Crown decides to charge her with.

I posted this for reassurance because my grief and helplessness weren't offering me the ability to look at this objectively. So thank you to everyone who said NTA. All of you who claimed YTA - y'all are some serious trolls, damn.",0
"For context I am 22F, and my grandma is 60F, my uncle is 32M. My uncle has struggled with drinking my whole life, it got worse after my mom died 14 years ago. He has been constantly in and out of rehabs and hospitals due to his drinking since I was eight years old. Let’s just say there’s a lot of trauma involving his drinking that I won’t disclose here. A few days ago my grandma called me told me I need to “call my uncle more” that “he is lonely and will drink again if he’s lonely” and that “his sobriety is on you.” 

I am 22 years old, 200 miles away at college. My grandma is across the country and my uncle lives at home with my grandpa. I told her that “It’s not on me to keep him sober, I am 200 miles away, I have classes, I am working and have my internship.” She responded sobbing that I “was the most selfish person on the planet, and that my mom had such a big heart and how can I be so different from her.” And then hung up on me.

I love my uncle  with my whole heart and I try to call when I can. I forget to call a lot, but I try to text him but he’s not much of a texted. And like I said earlier, I am taking 15 credits, working, doing 20 hours a week in my internship, am the Vice President of my sorority, and am trying to keep good grades to remain in honors. So am I the asshole for “telling my grandma off”?",0
"This is ridiculous and I can't believe I have to ask if I'm an asshole, but here we go.

I (f27) have been together with my husband Nate for over 10 years and married for 4. I don't have the best relationship with my MIL as she always seem to police what I eat.

Everyone in my family have fast metabolism, I am also working with horses so due to this burn a lot of calories (talking about 2.5-3k a day) and usually have rather large meals to get the energy back and I still remain skinny.

Now to the event. My in-laws invited me and Nate for dinner last Friday. I was very busy back then and haven't eaten since about 6-7am and also didn't have a chance to have a snack before heading to the restaurant so I was starving (I usually have something to eat before seeing my MIL to avoid her comments). Due to this I have ordered a large steak at the restaurant which was meant for 2 people, it also came with prawns, bacon and 2 sides. Please note it was not the most expensive item on the menu as some of my in laws had significantly pricier dishes and we were all splitting the bill anyway.

My MIL started making comments how I shouldn't be ordering what I can't eat since even her husband wouldn't be able to finish the dish, let alone someone my size. I smiled and said I haven't eaten since early morning and am starving, if I don't finish the steak I will take the leftovers home.

I have easily finished the steak and was waiting for my dessert, when my MIL flipped. She said I am attention seeking and was putting on a show, she also said I have made my FIL and BIL feel uneasy and that a woman shouldn't eat that much, it is unhealthy and something is wrong with me. She has then demanded me and Nate to cover the entire bill as she wasn't planning on ""such a big expenditure"". I said we are absolutely not covering the entire bill since it was meant to be split equally and reminded her of the dishes she ordered, that were significantly more expensive compared to my steak (including her starter). As a result I was called an asshole who has ruined a family dinner.

Nate is on my side but most of my in-laws are making very passive aggressive posts on social media about it and keep sending me different articles of ""what might cause excessive eating"".",0
"I (26F) am a full-time content creator (or as other people like to call it, influencer). I’ve been very lucky to have had a few of my videos go viral and grew an Instagram following in the 6 figures range; many of my followers are located in the general area I live in. With the following I have, I am able to make an income from doing brand partnerships and sponsored posts.

I wanted to work on my health and hired a highly recommended personal trainer (30sF) in the area. **I did NOT tell her that I was a content creator when I hired her.** After my first session, she posted some videos of me on her own Instagram page (she has about 10k followers), and some of her followers recognized me in her comments. That’s how she discovered my Instagram page.

When this happened, she called me and asked if I could tag her in my IG stories whenever I am practicing the workouts she gave me. She also asked me as a favor if I could create a before and after video to show my progress, post it on my Instagram, and then tag/mention her in the video. She told me that she is in the process of pitching a TV segment and her agent told her that having a bigger IG following would help her secure the deal.

Normally, for a series of IG story tagging and a dedicated IG video, I charge about $3000 dollars. I told her about my rate but since I really did like the workouts, I would be happy to do all of this if she could give me $1500 off her workout package. **I also emphasized to her that I am more than happy to pay her full, regular rate but I didn’t want to feel obligated to create content for her on my page if that was the case.**

She told me she would think about it and then hung up. She later texted me and said she felt very insulted that I would ask her for a discount for her services and that a few IG tags and IG video isn’t that much to ask for.

AITA?

EDIT: I think some people are confused so wanted to clarify: I had already planned on paying her full, regular rate when I started working with her. I never planned on asking for a discount until she asked me for the IG story tags and to create a video post for her. I am 100% happy to pay her full rate as long as there is no obligation for me to post about her on my personal IG page.

Edit 2: Some people are commenting accusing me of taking credit for her work on my IG page and that is not true at all. I have not posted anything at all regarding my workouts nor was I planning to. My Instagram page is centered around a specific topic and I create skits and tutorials related to my experience in this topic. Posting about my fitness/health journey would not be directly relevant to my normal content.",0
"I'm 27f and my husband is 30. We tried for a few years to have baby, long story short, it didn't work out and we ended up going through a couple rounds of IVF.

Fast forward. We find out we're pregnant and we are super happy, like over the moon ecstatic.  We couldn't wait for the 12 week mark to tell people, and started working on a nursery right away.

However, we go to our scan and find out we are having FOUR babies. Four. That's insane. I'm cutting a lot of backstory out because honestly, it's hard for me to talk about. At the time, my husband and I are just in shock, but happy we have healthy babies.

Now, I'm a small woman, 5'0 and very petite. At my next scan, it was suggested I consider aborting two of the pregnancies for the sake of my body, and to be honest, I was quietly considering bringing this idea up to my husband anyway because of the money involved with raising four children. We could afford two babies, but no way could we afford four.

Me and my husband are distraught that this is our reality, but we went home and tried to figure it out. From our latest scan, we know we have identical twin girls and two fraternal boys in there. If we go through with the selective abortion, which we most likely will, I brought up that I would like to keep the two girls as they are identical twins (I'm hoping they have the 'twin bond') and also, to be honest, I've always wanted girls.

My husband is on board with this, but as soon as I told my mother and sister the scenario they kicked off, calling us selfish, entitled, saying we are searching for designer babies, etc.

The way I see it is that we have to make a choice which babies go if we do this, and it breaks our hearts that we are in this position but we need to do what we can for the sake of our children. This story sounds so tragic, like a soap storyline or something but it's honestly the hardest thing I have ever done.

So, my question is both AITA for having a preference in this?

Okay, I know that the title makes it seem like AMTA but hear me out, that’s all I ask. 

Me (16 F) and my brother (23 M) are very close. We’ve had some crazy ass times together and he’s honestly my best friend. We may bicker from time to time, but we’re siblings 😂 what do you expect?

To get straight to the point, my mom (54 F) absolutely hates my SIL. 

My brother met her while he was out at a party about 5 years ago. Long story short they hit it off and now she’s his wife. He proposed in February 2020 and the proposal was a nightmare. 

He got on one knee and my mother went crazy 🤦🏾‍♀️ saying she didn’t want such a nasty, disrespectful woman to ruin our family. She didn’t want her to make my brother “less than a man” saying she wasn’t “woman enough” to be with my brother, saying all of this spiteful shit that quite frankly, wasn’t needed. 

Since then, he decided to go non contact from most of the family, except me and a few cousins. And my mom didn’t bother to reach out since then. She thinks that he should have stuck up for her. 

Recently, my brother posted a picture of his newborn son on his instagram. I posted it on my story saying congratulations and one of my aunts showed the post to my mom- 🤦🏾‍♀️ needless to say she was hurt. 

And I understand why she was hurt because it is her grandchild. But my brother told everyone (except for my mom) before he went non contact that the only reason why he’s ceasing contact is because he won’t tolerate the disrespect of his wife. 

They have three kids together and he’s made it clear she’s not going anywhere. He loves them with everything in him, so which means he’s not taking any shit from anyone. 

My mom asked me about the post and asked if I could call my brother to see if he would at least talk to her. I did ask him and he said no. I asked why and he said “(my name) my family means everything to me, and if she can’t understand that means my wife and my kids, then I won’t see her. Simple as that” I understood and we continued talking, catching up and stuff. You know the usual. 

The next day, she asked me if I called him and I said yes. I told her she wouldn’t like what she had to say and told her “the reason why he won’t talk to you is because he doesn’t like how you constantly disrespect his family” and she said: “his family is not family of mine, he knew that when he got that bitch pregnant the first time” 

About an hour later she took my phone, car, and my tv out my room. And told the family that I lied and made the whole situation up. And now the family is saying that I shouldn’t have lied on my brother and that I’m a bad daughter/sister 🤷🏾‍♀️ I really don’t care tbh because I don’t think I did anything wrong.

"My (27F) partner “S” (32M) and I have been together for \~3 years. Our relationship has always been a little odd from the outside. S works 80h+/week as a lawyer at a large firm. I work as a policy analyst for the gov and at a nice 37.5h/week in comparison. Before we dated, he told me that he wants to work up to being a partner and that that would require long hours. I told him that I prioritize work-life balance, even if it means a lower salary. We agreed to date knowing this about each other.

My best friend “V” (27F) and her boyfriend started dating our 1st year of uni and have a rocky relationship. The bf cheated on V in our last year of uni and he’s since been caught cheating again twice. V, against my advice, has chosen to stay with him.

S recently got a promotion and, as part of the deal, was assigned an assistant. When I met her I kind of got a vibe that she was crushing on S. She was really flirty and very attentive to S, which he pointed out to me first. He said that he’d still keep her on as assistant but that he would make sure nothing got out of hand. I wasn’t concerned, because I’ve never had a reason to worry that he would cheat on me.

One night V and I got dinner and later decided to go back to my place. S’s office is in between the restaurant we were at and my apartment building, so I offered to go drop off some food for him. I asked V if it was okay if we stopped and she agreed. When we got to his floor, he was working in a (glass-panelled) room alone with his assistant. I didn’t think much of it, dropped off the food and left. I also want to add that there were lots of other people in the office.

As soon as we left, V asked if that was the assistant that I thought had a crush on S. I said yes, that they often work late together. V got angry at me, saying that I was treating this like a joke and that if I want to keep my man, I have to stake my claim (or something). I explained to her that I wasn’t worried that he would cheat and that I trusted him. V told me that she was certain that he was cheating and that I should force him to ask for a different assistant.

I was getting kind of annoyed, but it got worse when V said, amongst other things, that S knows he can cheat on me and I’d let him because he makes more money than me so he doesn’t need to respect me bc he pays more. S’s salary is around 3x mine, although I have an okay salary myself (\~85k) and don’t need him for money. We split bills %-wise, so I pay less than he does, but it’s equitable and we agreed on it.

I told V that just because she’s okay being treated like a doormat doesn’t mean I am and that if he cheated on me, I would leave him. Respect is essential in a relationship. I also said that she had no place offering relationship advice considering her bf is a serial-cheater and they fought all the time, and that if she wanted to keep complaining to me I should start charging her. It was mean and I feel really bad about it now, she hasn’t talked to me since. So, AITA?",0
"Me (26F) and my fiancé (28M) are in the very early stages of wedding planning. Both of of our families have offered to chip in, but we’ll be covering the bulk. 

We’re both vegetarians and really only have dairy products very occasionally. 9/10 we choose the vegan option and mainly cook vegan for ourselves, just when we have the same meals as our baby (10 month old) we all eat the same. 

We can be in the same room as meat cooking etc, we’re not paticularly preachy, we just don’t want spend money for animals to die in celebration of our wedding. Feels wrong us paying into that industry. Also looking forward to having a choice rather than the one option. 

My mum has already made a comment that it’s not fair for us to not offer a meat option we’re of the mindset that it’s literally one afternoon we’re asking guests not eat meat.   No one in our guest lists have any other dietry requirements we need to think about.

She made the point that we’d expect a vegetarian option at someone else’s wedding. 

So WIBTA for not offering a meat option.",0
"My sister’s boyfriend “Derek” has been staying at our house since March. It has honestly been one of the worst things about never being able to leave the house. I didn’t even meet him before my parents allowed him to stay with us (they met him when they visited her at college). He’s really fucking grating, always thinks he’s the smartest person in the room, and is honestly just annoying af. He is not polite, never offers to do any chores or dishes or anything. Just a complete loser. I don’t get what my sister sees in him. 

Usually when I would watch something with my mom and dad, we would all kind of make comments about what was happening or whatever. But early on during his stay “Derek” said this was “too distracting” and he needed fo “focus”. I vented a little to my mom about Derek (including his need for dead silence when watching tv) and she said that she understood that it was frustrating but that we needed to make him comfortable as a guest.

I was good at this until last night. We were watching Molly’s Game and I was enjoying it. Maybe an hour in, during a transition from one scene to another, I asked my dad to pause it so I could go to the bathroom. And immediately after, Derek looks at me, puts his finger over his mouth and literally loudly shushes me like i’m a two year old. For just asking to pause the movie! I got beyond pissed off and was like “Fuck this, i’m not watching the movie with him. I just fucking can’t do it.” Maybe it wasn’t exactly that ( i don’t remember because i was so angry) but it was something like that. I didn’t personally insult him though. My mom calls after me but I just go to the bathroom and then my room. My sister texted me that I was behaving like a “fucking bitch” and I texted her back that her boyfriend was a “fucking tool.” 

My mom came into my room later and said that she understood why I felt the way I felt but that I need to apologize to Derek. I said I wouldn’t because I don’t thinK i did anything wrong. Anyway, now i’m in bed and dreading facing them so I probably won’t leave my room all day but I need to know if AITA here??


UPDATE: I didn’t apologize and things got worse. A couple of hours ago, I went to get breakfast and saw Derek in the hallway. I kind of glared at him and he went back into my sister’s room. My sister then came out and started yelling at me about how i’m making him uncomfortable. I basically told her everything i said here about him being lazy and rude. My mom and dad heard us yelling and came down and my sister “threatened” that she and him would leave to go to his mom’s house, which is a long drive away. I told her to leave and my mom started crying. My dad told us both to shut the fuck up and now i’m in my room. Great morning so far. I hope she fucking leaves.

UPDATE 2: thanks for all the comments. I appreciate the majority of people saying i’m nta. My sister told my mom who told me ( i know, very mature) that if i don’t apologize, they’ll leave this weekend. My mom practically begged me to apologize and my dad told me if i didn’t apologize, I would be in “big trouble” but i’m not threatened by that at all because wtf is he going to do? Ground me? Lol. I’m NEVER going to apologize. I’m so mad at my parents for falling for my sister’s obvious manipulative bullshit. If she wants to leave, she should just fucking do it instead of just threatening to do it.

UPDATE 3: I don’t know if anyone will read this but my sister and “derek” left early this morning. Derek and I didn’t talk directly since the night everything started. My sister was like “are you really not going to apologize” and i said that i had nothing to be sorry for and that obviously it was her choice whether to leave or stay. She said that Derek didn’t want to “walk on eggshells” around me and I said that that was what I was doing for two months so I didn’t have much sympathy. She was pissed at that. My mom and dad both tried to guilt me into apologizing. My mom even said that if my sister got sick after leaving, it would be my fault but again, my sister is CHOOSING to leave so it cant be my fault. My dad was like “just do it for your mom” and I was like “no. If derek wants to talk about it, i’m fine with that but i’m not going to apologize.” So they left. Honestly, i’m surprised that my sister actually followed through because usually she’s all talk but i’m happy with it. My mom was crying all day and she’s not talking to me. I feel bad for her but i really just couldnt do it anymore. Not really a happy ending but whatever.",0
"I’m a single mom to 2 kids (8 & 6). I work as a nurse. 3 days a week, I work 12 hour shifts (12 pm-12 am). After my husband passed, I needed a nanny to tend to my kids from the time they got off school (3 pm) onwards. I decided a live-in was the best choice. I have one guest bedroom. 

I live right near a university. Around this time, my niece had just gotten accepted. She wanted to save cost on dorms and offered to watch my kids those 3 days, if she could live there rent free. I agreed, and said I’d also pay her $22/hr (a competitive rate for our area). She’s done with her classes by 1, so it works out. She fixes them dinner and puts them to bed. Then she’s free to do whatever. But of course I pay her from 3 pm-12:30 am. It worked for 2 years. My niece never had any complaints.

Now, however, my niece is getting an (paid) internship related to her major that starts in January. She wouldn’t be available to watch my kids. I congratulated her and said I could help her look into student housing or an apartment. We’d have 3 months to do this. She was confused. I said since I would need a live in and only have one guest room, she would have to move out. My niece got upset and said this isn’t fair, she won’t be able to save any money if she gets a dorm or an apartment (she could afford to live on her own, but wouldn’t have much savings). I pointed out that this would work best for me as I had to put my kids in aftercare the other 2 days I work (I get off around 5) and the nanny could just pick them up from  school vs them having to stay there so long.

My niece argued that the nanny could leave at the end of her shift but after speaking to some nannies, they understandably don’t want to drive home so late. Plus, I’m fine with the nanny (and my niece) sleeping after the kids do. So, there’s no sense in them sleeping then waking up and driving so drowsy. Even I feel nervous driving home so late, especially after my long shift. 

My SIL (her mom) feels this is unfair to my niece but she moved in under the condition that she’d work as a nanny. My SIL and brother live 3 hours away, so niece couldn’t commute if she moved back in with them. They feel I should try to find a nanny who’d be willing to drive home at 12:30 AM (it’d take me a half hour minimum to get home), but all nannies I’ve spoken to have said no or expressed concern about their safety driving so late. 

AITA?


EDIT to answer from FAQ: The internship is all semester long. My niece isn’t interested in nannying at all going forward and will instead be pursuing internships. She has no desire to work after her internship is over for the day.

She knew from the jump that I was only looking for a live in specifically for childcare.

I have also provided her written notice and am covering my ass legally.",0
"A few years ago I met my dad for the first time. My mother had given me up for adoption, so he didn’t know about me until the magic of DNA tests connected us. Since we connected, we have been building a relationship, with mutual visits and occasional phone calls. (We live on opposite sides of the country.)

He got divorced a few years ago and since then has been dating “Liz”. Liz is significantly younger than he is, and is an extrovert with a big personality. She was widowed a few years ago and she and my dad (who had known each other for years) started dating shortly thereafter. 

My dad recently retired and bought a condo in Florida. He suggested coming to my house for Christmas and then the two of us roadtripping across the country to his condo as a fun father-child bonding experience. I agreed that it sounded fun, and so we spent late December and early January adventuring together. 

In the course of our discussions, he told me that Liz had done a number of things which make me concerned for him. For instance, she decided she wanted him to move in with her, so she sent him to see one of his other children for a week and while he was gone she went to his house, gave away most of his possesssions, and moved some of her friends into his house. He was very upset, but she told him he was being irrational and needed to move on. When he decided to buy his condo in Florida, she told him that she would be in charge of decorating it, then proceeded to insist on choices of furniture and dishes which are deeply impractical for day-to-day use — for instance, insisting that the only dishes be his grandmother’s china set, none of which is dishwashable, and which contains so many place settings it completely filled the kitchen cupboards leaving almost no room for food. Whenever he tries to assert his preferences or tastes or the need for practicality, she gets upset and gives him ultimatums. 

Over the course of the time we spent together, he talked through all of this with me and was clearly upset by it. 

I finally told him that it seemed like many of the dynamics in their relationship aren’t very healthy, and that he needed to be willing to set boundaries that gave him some control over his own life and choices. We subsequently purchased a few needed practical things for the condo without Liz’s blessing, about which she is now irate. 

In my subsequent conversations with my father, it seems increasingly likely their relationship is going to end.

"Story time. When my partner (M32) and I (F30) got together we were very open and clear cut about what we wanted in life and both had come out of terrible 6yr relationships about 4 yrs prior. The thing that I was honestly impressed with, was that our relationship *if we so chose to have one* (we were talking at the time) is that being friends with your ex wad a potential problem and we both agreed on it being respectful and to not engage in that kind of behavior. He had brought it up.

Come to find out that he had (and still to this day apparently) is talking to her (F32). We had a huge blow out when I initially found out that she was an ex. 

Coming from my last relationship (my ex's ""best friend"" *while I was pregnant*, best friend was female) caused me a lot of red flags that I couldn't see clearly due to over all financial - and medical stressor on his side. As well as the ex had high functioning autism- & has a very manipulative and controlling personality.

Back to  original blow out...

I communicated that I was not comfortable with this kind of communication, much less that he was discussing our relationship and problems with her.

He went full burn it down mode- threatening to delete his whole social media account/diconnecting from every female he knew etc. It felt very reminiscent of my previous situation, which sucked big time.

It took a long while for it all to cool off, I tried to communicate with said person (as they had been childhood friends), she said my magic trigger words ""He's my best friend"". TF?  

This person is married w/ kids. Your partner should be your best friend. I mean that's a big part of it the relationship (personally).

Tried to create a relationship with this person, but it fell off as they live two states away. I did not see the value of thier/ our relationship with someone that is not involved in our lives.

He ended up deleting her off his friends list and everything seemed to be ok after that (ish). 

Now come to find out they are still talking off and on. 

She initiated conversation this last October... Asking how her new glasses looked on her...😑

I don't know how to bring it up again with communicating my discomfort of the situation or if I should just get on the profile and block her. 

It just seems like he's looking for feminine energy and I'm not enough 😒 

And feeling bouts of insecurity because I am half way through pregnancy ... 

So that's an added bonus. 

Looking for some insight


-Edit-

***just to add in here, partner and I at the beginning of relationship had discussed previous relationships and was told of this specific encounter when they first consummated the relationship*** ngl a little green eyed monster showed up for a min

Married over a year now-  got married because we wanted to start a family together. Events happened one yr into living together as bf/gf - it has now been 2yrs since he had removed her from social media 

Ex had ""seeded"" several relationships over 6yr marriage, and is still doing so with new wife (the ""best friend"") recently was reached out to by one, and helping her through the manipulative things he did to her too",0
"The title is horrible but hear me out please.

I have been best friends with Lily for 15 years. She has always been overweight, even as a kid. Come high school and college it became like 100 lbs overweight. She has some serious self-esteem issues stemming from this. I have been a little chubby my whole life as well, though not so much in recent years, so I was always able to empathize with her.

So last year Lily hit 25 and gifted herself a personal trainer. This trainer literally changed Lily’s life. It was like a switch got flipped and all of a sudden Lily just became so motivated. I was, and still am, incredibly happy for her. She lost 120 lbs, a whole person, and looks so much heathier. 

This real problem is Lily’s entire self-esteem has always been tied to her weight, and that hasn’t changed. It started maybe 40lbs into her weight loss, she started saying pretty rude stuff about obese people. Then it’s just gotten worse and worse. She joined this toxic group of people online who have lost massive amounts of weight. Lily showed me some of the memes and stuff they share there and its all vile fat shaming drivel. 

Everything came to a head over the phone the other night. We were just catching up and she starts talking about her brother’s new girlfriend. Apparently this girl is very overweight. She was saying horrible shit, like “Brother is way too good for a fat slob like her”, “That kind of fat is just from pure laziness, trust me I know”, “She should know she isn’t worthy of him” etc.

I called her out of being such a bitch and she gives me this long rant about how she can say all these things because she knows firsthand there is no excuse to being fat. Her mentality is that being fat is a weakness of character and makes you “lesser” than average or fit people. Now that she is “fit” she is better than them basically. It honestly made me sick.

This is where I think I may have crossed a line. I told her in response that I honestly liked her better when she was fat. That her losing weight gave her a superiority complex and I’m sick of it. I told her to get over herself then hung up.

We have had spats before and they never really lasted for more than a day. It’s been three and she hasn’t spoke to me. I tried to reach out to bury the hatchet but she is ghosting me. 

I need a third party to tell me if I crossed a line here? I know what I said was harsh but at the time I really thought she needed a slap to the face.

TLDR: Best friend becomes a fat-shamer after losing weight and I told her I liked her better fat.",0
"Throw away because of personal details. 

My daughters birthday was on December first, she turned 17. I got her something that I didn’t get until my mid 20s, a car. 

I had my daughter very young (when I was her age) and want her to have all of the opportunity that I didn’t. She got her first part time job, and I wanted her to be able to travel without worrying about the bus or depending on people. I saved for nearly a year to get her a car, a 2008 Nissan Altima. I’m obviously not wealthy, this car is better than *my* car. It’s newer, safer and rides much better. 

When I gave her the car she turned her nose up at it. She complained, and nearly cried. She pointed out small dings and scratches, she said the color is ugly, and that she would be embarrassed to drive it. Besides being angry about this, my feelings are hurt. I put a lot of love into this car. 

My daughters mother is now married, and they take in foster children. Their current foster is a year older than my daughter, she has been living with them for around two years. My ex and her husband are actually going through the process of adopting her. This girl has had it rough, but she’s very kind and hard working. She is doing dual enrollment at the local community college. She takes the bus about an hour each way. 

I was hoping that my daughter would be able to help give her rides so that the car would benefit both of them. I had the idea to just give the car to the foster daughter. WIBTA for this? 

My girlfriend says that it would be an asshole move because my daughter would come to her senses and eventually want the car. With how she turned her nose up at it, I would feel better giving it to someone that I know would appreciate it and teach my daughter a lesson in the process.

UPDATE:
All of the adults involved will be hammering out the situation this weekend, and many people have asked for an update so I will let you all know what happens. As it stands though, my daughter will not be getting a car.",0
"My mom passed away when I was 10. My parents were already divorced at this point, so I was the sole beneficiary of her estate, so I have a trust fund which my granddad manages for me until I turn 25 (I’m currently 18). As a part of the trust, my mother left me behind some money to pay for college which I will be getting access to soon.  

My dad remarried my stepmother shortly after his divorce with my mother and she has two daughters (Hannah, 16 and Emma, 18). Since my mom passed, I’ve been living with my dad full time and spend school holidays with my grandparents. For the first few years, things were okay but then my stepsisters started to complain about my time with my grandparents (because they took me and my cousins on fancy international trips and they were jealous) and my dad started trying to force me to limit contact with them. My grandparents ended up threatening to sue my dad for grandparents’ rights so he stopped, instead he started refusing to give me permission to fly abroad and wouldn’t let me keep all of the gifts my grandparents bought me.

Recently, my dad and stepmom sat me and Emma down and informed us that they wouldn’t be able to help us with college because they’d run into some financial trouble a few years ago and had to use the money to keep us afloat. Emma was devastated and when I didn’t have the same reaction, my dad asked me why I wasn’t upset. I explained that I still have the money mom left me, that my grandparents also had a separate college fund for me and that my aunts and uncle (mom’s siblings) also had smaller college funds for me. My aunt on my dad’s side also gave me $5k as a high school graduation gift/money for college so I should be able to complete my degree without needing to get any loans as long as I work part-time too. My dad already knew about the money my mom left me but he had no idea about the rest. 

Emma and my stepmom started insisting I had to share the college funds with Emma, otherwise it wouldn’t be fair. I refused, this is my mom’s family’s money so I don’t think I should share with someone who isn’t even related to them. My stepmom started screaming at me and calling me ungrateful for all of the things she’s done for me and that she was going to sue me for all of the money she spent on me growing up. My dad got angry with her and told her to stop and now they’re not speaking to each other. He said he’s happy that I’ll be able to go to college without any debts but if I would please consider giving her at least one of the smaller funds.

Since then, Emma and Hannah have been horrible to me. My stepmom keeps forcing me to do all of Emma’s chores and Hannah said if our parents divorce it’ll be all of my fault for being a greed b\*\*\*h.

"I just turned 18(f) 2 weeks ago. I'm the youngest of 4 kids and on their 18th birthdays, all of my siblings got given a car by our dad. The condition was that you had to maintain good grades, which they all did.

I'm definitely the dumbest of the kids haha and i'm a fairly middle student, I do ok but I'm not like my siblings who get good grades pretty easily. But I honestly try my best and have had a tutor and i've never failed a class or even just scraped a pass.

My birthday just came and went and while my mum bought me some really lovely presents, my dad (they are separated) got me some perfume which was lovely but there was no mention of the car. I didn't want to say anything in front of everyone but my brother and sister who were there gave each other the whole smirkey side-eye thing when they saw I didn't get the box with keys in that they got.  I pretended like I didn't see.

The next day I was pretty upset so I asked my dad why I hadn't got the car like my siblings had. He said my grades were ok but not ""at their level"". I got upset and said that he knew I'd really tried and I'd gone to every session with my tutor and done my best. He said ""then it looks like your best isn't good enough"" and I shouted at him that I was sick of being the least favourite child. He called me an entitled b\*tch but I feel like I'm held to a different standard because I'm not so smart. AITA?

EDIT: sorry I messed up a typo

EDIT 2: Thank you everyone for your comments and opinions, I've found it all very helpful and I thought  I should answer some of the questions here. I am autistic which is one of the reasons I have a tutor who specialises in working with people on the spectrum and she has helped me get my grades from Cs to all Bs and 1 C. My dad never said specifically what 'good' grades are or what I had to aim for but I know now he must have meant As because my siblings got lots of As and a few Bs",0
"I was at a large grocery store yesterday and I walked up to the butcher area to ask for assistance but there was one person ahead of me. When the person finished, I was just about to ask the butcher my question when a woman cut in front of me and asked him, ""Hi, can you please help me in the freezer aisle?"" The butcher said ""yes"" and was about to follow her when I interjected, ""Sir, I was here first."" I swear I saw an eye roll on his part but whatever.

Moving on. I had a cart full of groceries and I stood in line to check out. There was a woman who was unloading her packed cart in front of me so I waited a few feet behind her because had I moved my cart forward, I would have been blocking the traffic for other customers to walk through. Then, I see the same woman, who cut me off in the butcher station, nonchalantly walk in front of me and then she proceeded to unload her items onto the conveyor belt. I told her, ""Excuse me, ma'am, I've been waiting here. I'm next in line."" She gave me a smug look and said, ""Ha, if you're next, then why are you standing back there and not here??"" So I told her, ""Because I don't want to block the flow of traffic walking by but I AM NEXT.""

Guys, she continued to argue with me saying, ""Well....you should've moved forward"" and then CONTINUED to unload her groceries. Keep in mind that I am not a confrontational person. In my 44 years on this planet, I have never been in a fist fight, In fact, I used to be a major pushover. If I was 18, I may have told her, ""You're right, go ahead."" Well, that's not what happened.

I. SAW. RED. I YELLED at her, ""Listen lady, I'm a civilized person who takes others into consideration, UNLIKE YOU who probably doesn't give a shit would've blocked this entire area. Now put your things back into your cart NOW or I'm going to go over there and do it for you!"" Then, the kind lady that was originally in front of me, and had finally completed her transaction, took one look at her and said, ""Seriously? You need to move because she HAS been waiting."" You'd think that she would have backed off? Nope. She continued to unload her groceries muttering that I should've been closer and not standing so far in the back.

I yelled, ""I'm NOT going to tell you again. Get your shit and put it back into your basket or I'll go and do it myself. NOW."" She then took a good look at me and started putting her things back in her cart and walked away. I would imagine that by this point, my eyes were crossing and my head was two seconds from spinning like the kid from the Exorcist. I can't remember the last time I've felt so angry.

She finally moved but she kept staring me down and I'm ashamed to tell you guys that I screamed ""WHAT THE F\*\*K ARE YOU LOOKING AT????????"" She finally looked away and as quick as this started, it ended. The nice lady that was in front of me patted me on my back and told me that she was impressed how I defended myself but to please calm down because I looked like I was about to pass out.

I need to add that since the store was so packed and music was blaring, not many people witnessed what went down.  Only those within hearing range were able to witness this exchange.  I know....  No excuses.

To be honest, at this point in my life, I've let people walk all over me. If this had happened ten years ago, I would've let her go on ahead of me. Not now. I'm a jaded, middle aged woman who is not the one. Don't get me wrong, what came out of me yesterday felt like an out of body experience. I'm not a mean person. She just sparked something in me that threw me over the edge.

Edit: This may or may not be relevant, but I'm a Mexican American and all of this occurred in Spanish. I am a fluent bilingual speaker but I usually speak English. I didn't even know that I could fight the way I did in Spanish. Believe me, if you guys knew how to speak Spanish, I would've written the exact exchange I had with this entitled twit in Spanish. I don't know why but when arguments happen in Spanish, it looks like a much bigger deal!! ha!

EDIT:  I'm getting some flack from some who are calling me an asshole because I assumed that there wasn't a single person here that could speak or read in Spanish.  I know a lot of you can so  I translated this story into Spanish so it's somewhere within this thread.

"I am reposting this from different account because previous account wasn't submitting the post properly. 

I and my wife have been married for 8 years. 
We have a 1yo daughter. 

I'm an automobile engineer and my wife is a SAHM. 

For her birthday, I wanted to give he something special so I got her a really expensive perfume that she'd wanted for a long time. To prevent her from seeing it before her birthday, I kept it in a cupboard near the ceiling. Usually, I do all the cleaning there since my wife is allergic to dust and she wouldn't be able to reach out anyway since it's so high. 

When I came home a few days ago, I got glass shards stuck in my foot just as I walked into the house. It started bleeding heavily and I had to call my neighbor to take me to the hospital since I couldn't even walk. My wife wanted to drive but she cannot as she's still learning to drive and doesn't have a license yet. 

Now I've been advised by my doc to not walk for a few more weeks because the cuts on my foot were too deep and required surgery to be removed. 

My wife said that she'd seen me putting a bottle in the topmost shelf and she was curious so she used a step ladder and a stool on top of that to take out the bottle. While getting down, she dropped the perfume bottle and it shattered. While cleaning it up she missed a few pieces and I got injured. 

So I just gave her some flowers and a box of chocolates on her birthday as I had already spent most of my fun money on the perfume alone. She got mad at me saying it was my mistake for keeping it in the cupboard and that she didn't break it on purpose.

"AITA? His entire family is ripping me to shreds and I don’t understand. So my ex and I have a son together who is six. We split up when he was one and things were messy at first but have been peaceful for the past four years or so. We’ve both moved on and entered new relationships. His girlfriend he’s been with since the beginning of 2022 is such a kind woman and always went out of her way to befriend me which was nice. When they announced their pregnancy everyone was pleasantly surprised but it was pretty soon after his latest breakup so his family didn’t like her which I found odd since that’s not her fault. But I digress. 

Sadly she passed away in childbirth and the baby also passed as well in November of 2022. It was extremely heartbreaking, I cried and grieved her loss as well. My ex understandably had his entire earth shattered and was going through one of the worst times of his life so I completely understood him needing time to not be a parent and didn’t have any issues with that. He didn’t reply to any of my messages except to say he didn’t want our son to know as he was excited to have a little brother and wants to be the one to tell him and that was in November. He also didn’t want our son to attend the funeral. I completely understood and didn’t tell my son expecting my ex to keep his word. 

In December I still heard no word from him regarding our son or coparenting situation. I completely understood he needed time and waited. In January still no word. . My husband said that even with what happened he should at least call or FaceTime if he can’t do in person parenting and I agree. I reached out to his parents then and they said that they are willing to “parent” their grandson while their son grieves. My son is six, he’s old enough to understand some things. He’s been asking non stop about his dad and little brother and when he’s going to meet them. I had told them that they were very busy and daddy would come see him soon to let him know but I can only use that excuse for so long.

 I did tell him in the beginning of February the truth, that his stepmom passed away and so did the baby and that they are in heaven and that daddy is sad and needs time to rest and feel better. That actually really helped him understand and he stopped asking and instead was drawing pictures to cheer his dad up. Yesterday he messaged me for the first time in months saying he wants to see our son for HIS birthday (my ex not my sons) which is next weekend and he wants to explain everything then. I told him since he went ghost on me since November I told our son earlier in the month since he wouldn’t stop asking and he needed answers. He started cursing at me saying I’m a bitch and asshole and that it wasn’t my place to tell him and that I “took that away from him”. He hung up and now his siblings and parents are posting subs at me online and calling me and texting me saying the same. AITA??",0
"

So I (f34) was having a horrible toothache, I'd taken medication to ease the pain but it was bad, like you-need to go-to the dentist level of bad. I scheduled an appointment and was told to come yesterday.

My husband's (m37) best friend ""Terry"" (m33) got into an accident and injured his knee. he has been staying with us for several weeks. My husband looks after him as he sees him living alone and in need of assistance. I welcomed him to our home but found myself having to clean up after him and bring him his medication and also cook for him. And if I take a long time to get something done he'd call my husband and basically ""tell on me"" which makes my husband mad. he says it's temporary and also since I'm home 24/7 and he is the working then I should help caring for his friend. It has became quite overwhelming because now I can't leave the house if my husband isn't there with his friend.

Like I stated previously about the dental appointment, I told my husband the night before and he pitched a hissy fit saying I can't leave Terry home alone. I suggested he take time off work and stay with him but he said it wouldn't work with such a short notice. he suggested that I reschedule but I said no, even showed him how bad the swelling was, yet he told me to hold on for another day.

He went to work early and I decided I was still going to go. Terry was in the livingroom (he sleeps on a large mattress in the living room) and saw me making my way out as mom was waiting at the door. He asked where I was going and I told him to the dental appointment. He had an attitude and raised his voice at me telling me to go back upstairs and cancel. mom stepped in and started arguing with him asking who he think he is, he went on about how he was unable to move and then threatened to call my husband if I stepped a foot out the door. I took my mom and left. He ended up calling my husband who then tried to call me over and over for 2 hours til I turned my phone off.

Instead of returning home, I went to stay with my mom because I was in tremendous pain and my husband started yelling at me calling me stubborn for still going after he told me to reschedule and irresponsible for leaving his injured friend home alone. Mom told him off which escalated the argument between us. He is now currently staying at home along with his friend while constantly pressuring me to stop hiding behind mom and come deal with the results of having him leave his job for hours after I blind sided him and went against his wishes.

"My wife and I have been married for 16 years. I'm a 42m and she's a 41f. We have two girls; 13 and 12.

Soon after we were married we kind of made a deal. My wife is huge into scrapbooking. I really don't even know much about it, but it's her thing and I'm glad she enjoys it. She told me that about once a month she's going to kick me out of the house so that she and her girlfriends can scrapbook together, drink some wine, and just have fun. I told her fine, just as long as she understands that every so often I'm going to want a golf, hunting, or fishing weekend with my buddies, and as long as it's not interfering with something important or that I don't do it too often that I don't want to get a hard time about it. I still remember the conversation, and her saying ""Yes. Fair. Deal.""

Over the years she's definitely made me hold up my end of our bargain; which I've had no problem with. And when our girls came along it gave me the chance to either bring them over to my parents so that they could visit their grandkids, or taking them for pizza or ice cream and to catch a movie with them. It's actually created some very fond memories for me. But, now the girls are getting older and usually just go to a friend's house or something, and I usually just end up going to see a movie or having a couple drinks at the bar by myself.

As far as those ""guy's weekends"" that I'd originally envisioned; they haven't really panned out that much. Most of my old buddies from back then have scattered and we don't really keep in touch that much anymore. Botton line; I just haven't had nearly as many ""guy weekends"" as I thought I would.

However I've picked up new buddies over the years at my job, and one thing we like to do is have poker night fairly often. We've never had one at our house, and recently I volunteered it. When I told my wife about it, though, I got push back. She's kind of a homebody, and said on a Friday night after a long work week that the last she wanted was to get kicked out of her own home and have to go figure out something to do with herself. I reminded her of all the times I'd been kicked out so that she could scrapbook but she responded that this was different; that there was years of precedent for it, and that I'd agreed to it. But she said that she'd never agreed to letting me host poker night for the guys. It turned into a pretty big argument.

She's being kind of unfair and selfish as far as I'm concerned, but I can't argue that at least technically I've agreed to getting kicked out of the house for scrapbooking while she never agreed to getting kicked out for poker night. So, AITA?",0
"My son, Jack (25) and his girlfriend, Becky (24) have lived with us since the middle of the last year. When he moved in and then eventually she did, the expectation ( with all of my children, if they weren't in school) was that they were to pay rent. My son and his girlfriend both do not attend college. My husband and I didn't expect them to pay a lot, just $100 ea. Being that they are adults, we figured this would be a way for them to contribute but also so they would be able to save money to get their own place and be in a good spot financially when they left.

Since Christmas, there has been numerous times when bringing up the subject of helping out (dishes, garbage), I would get rude comments or remarks back. Such as, ""I pay rent now, I don't have to bring the dirty dishes up ( or garbage)"" ""That's none of your business, I am an adult and don't need to be told what to do"". I have also asked that his girlfriend not smoke pot in the house. I have been told that she doesn't but we can smell it.

So a month ago, He asked if I would co-sign on a car loan, I said yes. I only did it because he has been super responsible his whole life. Now, Every other week, he and his girlfriend call in to work 1 to 2 days. I only worry now that now that he has his car, he will lose this job and I will have another car payment.

Now I have talked to him previously about all of the things, yesterday, he and his girlfriend called into work. And late last night, the house started smelling of pot. Being as our room is directly above theirs, it smelled all night.

When I tried to talk to them, I was ignored. I tried calling and texting, and I received no response. My husband wants to give them an ultimatum and I am not sure that would be the right move.

AITA?

Update: I first want to say thank you to everyone for the advice. Second, My husband and I did talk with Jack last night. We told him all the things that needed to change or the consequence would be that he and Becky had until the 1st of April to to leave. He responded better than I thought he would have. But he agreed that it was time to find their own space. He apologized and said they would begin looking. I told him that if he misses one month of paying for his car, I would be talking it away. I will not be on the hook for his irresponsibility ( even though I am). He also gave some excuse for the smell of pot in the house that I didn't accept but gave him a hard boundary that if I smell it in the house again, they will be gone that day. He said that he would make sure that she goes outside every time. I also want to clarify, I don't mind that they do it, I just really don't like the smell. So, now we wait..

Also wanted to add since a lot of people have said that he doesn't sound super responsible. Before he met his current girlfriend, he most definitely was. He has great about doing what he had to when he had to. Just he has not been that way lately. 

Again, thank you all. I truly appreciated all the advice!",0
"im 25(m) and for as far back as i remember my sister has treated me like trash, she would shout and cuss at me for every little thing that was ""annoying"" she would mock for not having friends or for wearing glasses she would ask me for ""favors"" to go to the store and gets her stuff but if i didn't want to i was lazy and selfish but i couldn't dare to ask her because i would be lazy and she wanted to go out ,she would belittle me for everything and anything even the why i walk or eat. my mother never wanted to take sides and my father didn't bother to care. 

 now a few months back she rented an apartment with her best friend and things seemed to go well but they had a fight and the fell out and now she is back with us ( me and my parents) and she takes medication cause she gets panic attacks and goes and sees a phycologist , and all of a sudden i have to treat her nice even though she complains all the time because we bother her with our existence and she take medications and she is ""not well"" and my mother shouts at me because i just don't care and don't want to bother to step lightly around her anymore , i don't care that she is sick and i don't care she has issues I had issues for 25 gears almost but noooo she is sick and need help how about no , she treated me like trash she can deal with it",0
"I call myself M for me, AM for annoying mother and AK for annoying kid. So I was around 10 at the time and we went to a trampoline park while on vacation. So me my brother L my other brother P and my sister R all went to the area that had a basketball hoop, and we started just chilling playing and talking when we decided to play dodge ball, we started playing and we were all dodging when AM and AK came into the basketball area, the mom sat down and AK tried joining us in our game, we said fine cuz the ball wasn't ours and he seemed nice. So we started playing when we hit AK in the face on accident, he got mad/sad and ran over to his mom and told her, soon AK came back with his mom. AM started playing with us and was really mad at us so started targeting us and hitting us, we noticed and threw back and eventually hit her in the face. So guess what she does. Gets right in my face and asks for our parents. Of course stranger danger so we just said no. Then she asked my brother he didn't answer either so the mom left and I thought that was the end, but soon me and L left the basketball area and went to our parents but right as we got there our parents asked, ""what did you do?"" Apperently AM asked everyone in the trampoline park if they were our parents, we told them everything and took our side, I soon walked around and talked to my brother and sister, P and R.

"We had a small gathering last week. Cake n ice cream for our daughter's bday. We bought paper cake plates and plastic silverware for the people we had over to use. One of the guests asked if they could use one of the small bowls that are almost plates I had tucked away in the corner of the counter. I explained those were my dishes so no. Everyone I know including this guest knows I cannot eat gluten. Now reddit does too. Even cross contamination makes me sick. I had just had a conversation with this person about how I was going to have to wash the kitchen and all door handles down because of the cake. It was a normal cake and that was why I wasn't eating it. I offered a regular plate to them but it was ""too big""  A few minutes later I see them eating cake from my dish. When they were finished I asked if they were done. Yes. Took the bowl and threw it in the trash. Guest said that was an asshole move. I told them ""I told you not to use it"" I didn't make a scene. Just threw it away. Was ITAH for tossing the dish right away in front of them instead of waiting? I didn't want it accidentally washed and put back with my dishes. And I didn't want anyone seeing it with cake and taking another dish.",0
"I (f19) am the youngest of 5. I have four older brothers (21,22,25,28). Just to give some background my mom has always loved being a boy mom. She dotes on them and made it very very clear she never wanted to and didn’t like having a daughter. She never liked me and i accepted that long time ago and her behavior towards me worsened when my dad left her. 

When i turned 16, her gift to me was a list of jobs i can apply to, to “pay for my expenses” even though my dad was giving her child support. Then at 17 she kicked me out because i wasn’t willing to pay more than $400 rent while my brothers didn’t even work. 

So, she asked to meet me for lunch last weekend and told me she is sick. She has been in and out of the hospital the last few months before she found out she’s sick and looking at 12-18 months before she’ll be too weak/ill to care for herself. She asked when that time came if i’d be willing to be her caretaker as she didn’t want men, aka my brothers, to take care of her in that state and didn’t want a stranger to either. 

Here’s where i’m questioning if i’m TA. I told her no, i won’t care for her and she should start looking for someone she knows who’d be willing to because i’m not. This past week, i’ve been receiving nasty messages from everyone from my moms facebook because she posted about me not “caring about her”. They’ve called me unsympathetic, selfish, mean spirited, uncaring etc. My brothers have also been mad at me. Now i feel like an asshole and want to know if i am.

Edit: I want to clarify, i do not live with my mom and haven’t for over 2 years now. When she put me out, i never went back. My dad is involved in my life but i keep him at a distance because i’m still going through stuff (which i am going to therapy for) and partly blame him for never sticking up for because he knew how she treated me. But he is here for me and i have friends and family on my dads side who’s supporting me. And I’ve been going through the comments and reading DM’s bawling my eyes out, y’all are so nice and i want to thank you all for your kind words it means so much. I’ll give you all virtual hugs because you guys really made my night, thank you!!!!❤️🤗",0
"Me (36M) and my ex (33f) are in the process of getting a divorce after 10 years of marriage. Nothing is finalized as that is expensive and I currently do not have the funds to afford an attorney. A lot of our problems we had stemmed from my repressed trauma as a child and I was inadvertently and unknowingly letting my conditioned behaviors out on her. Through counseling, I am doing my best to become a better person and deal with my past trauma and not let it hurt the people I love the most.
That being said I don't want my kids around my ex's (m50) bf. He drinks & smokes to excess and I feel is a pervert. About 1.5 years ago she cheated on me with him & lied to my face about it. A month later she walked out on me and our (now 13m, 7f) children. I found out she was cheating the entire time as she left her Facebook open on our computer when she went on vacation w/her mom. I saw pictures and convs that stick with me today. She came back a couple of times to try and work things out, but that was only cuz they were fighting & she needed a place to stay. 
One weekend she took the kids & they spent their time at a local hotel/pool. My son wanted to come home cuz he was bored. When my daughter came home later she told me in her little kid words she saw mommy having S** with her bf. I reported the incident to dhs as this wasn't the first time my daughter said something about their behavior (excessive making out, gr***** each other) and it was making our then 6 y/o uncomfortable. Whenever I would say something to my ex about toning it down she would balk. The S** was the last straw. My ex has known this man since she was in HS. I never knew the exact age until recently where I discovered they met when she was 14. Many of the conversations the two of them had eluded to them having an inappropriate relationship when she was a teenager. And while I have no concrete proof, the phrase ""You are the first man I have ever done anything with and I hope to be the last"" stuck with me. Knowing she said that to him brings up a HUGE red flag especially since we have a young daughter together. I brought these concerns to her and it's always ""he's not like that"" and she thinks I'm an AH because she left me for him.

 She's barely seen either of them this past 1.5 years and only spends time with them when it's convenient for her. I am not preventing her from being with her kids, she chooses not to. There is no formal custody arrangement as we are not officially divorced. I want my kids to have a good relationship with their mother if they so choose, but I will not force them into a situation where they are uncomfortable. I do not want them to be around her bf thinking  his behavior is acceptable & I also do not want my daughter in a position of being with a possible p***. All that being said she still thinks I'm an AH and it's because she left me.",0
"Today I \[21F\] went to Target to get some groceries and saw a homeless person asking people (including me) for something to eat. I normally get super paranoid about safety, living in the city, and don't ever talk to someone I don't know. But today, I bought a loaf of bread and offered it to the person on the way out. Note: I didn't say a single word but just physically held out the bread to offer it if they want it, when they asked me for food again.

The person got super rude and condescending, saying what on earth would they eat it with. And then proceeded to call me stupid while making hand gestures. What struck me the most was he was awfully rude to me while he would act in an appeasing way to other people passing by, even when they would just ignore him and move on.

I don't know, I feel like it's a sign that the one time I got out of my comfort zone to help someone ended up like this. But to double check, did I do something wrong in any way?

TLDR; I offered a loaf of bread to a homeless person but was received rudely.

&#x200B;

Edit: people are getting really offended that I offered this person a loaf of bread, as if I treated them like a dog or a duck. But I only offered them that because whenever I go hungry or am without money in-between paychecks, I ate plain bread all the time. I don't mind being told I'm the AH but wouldn't like my intentions to be misinterpreted.

&#x200B;

Edit2: I've had the time to read over everyone's comments and I wanted to thank everyone who left me genuine wishes, stories, or advices! I hadn't expected my post to blow up like this.

Just wanted to make a quick clarification, about my last edit. Someone pointed it out to me. When I said I ate bread for meals, I meant it during my college days when I only had a part-time job, and only for some periods of times between pays every now and then. I definitely know I was still privileged and don't want to be accidentally disrespectful by pretending not to be.

I've been inspired by a lot of people in this thread, and definitely want continue helping -- only this time probably through a food drive or charity. Thank you again to everyone who cared to leave me their thoughts and perspective! And thank you for the kind medals as well :)",0
"I (35m) am engaged to May (35f).  My best friend, Andre (35m) is the best man.  Fake names.

First, details.  May is a huge anime and gamer nerd.  Like, huge.  We're all gamers, but she has like every system under the sun and loves playing video games, including the retro ones like Tetris and Sonic.  She's also into MMORPG like FFXIV and JRPGs like the Tales of Series and games like My Time at Portia and Animal Crossing.

May and Andre have always gotten along, but they never actually hung out near video games together.  I had him and two of our other friends over for a couple beers and cigars.  Andre heard May turn on her Switch, and he asked if she had Super Smash Bros.  She said yes, and Andre said, ""Let me show you a thing or two"" in a joking manner.  I warned Andre that he was going to get thrashed, to which he made the comment, ""Girl gamers don't scare me.""  No, May did not hear him.

Well, May suited up with Yoshi, and she annihilated all of them without trying.  They asked her to change characters.  She went to Young Link then Peach then Jiggly Puff then Roy and lastly, her favorite character, Ness.  Creamed all of them.  Now, I'll admit, my friends have short tempers with gaming.  I could see they were frustrated, so I proposed we do something else.  Everyone except Andre was done with the games.  He proposed they play Tetris (free on the Switch and already downloaded).

And, once again, Andre lost.  Hard.  Like, extra hard.  Painfully hard.  To put it short, he got completely thrashed.  May won 1st place in 2 player every game.  Andre stopped playing and they all went home afterwards, annoyed.  I don't think May noticed.

Later on, Andre and my friends invited May to a game of Rainbow Six.  May gladly accepted and chose her favorite, Frost.  They played the private party matches and she basically was always the last one standing.  May told the guys she was going to take a bathroom break and put her headset down.  I asked May if I could play the next round.  She agreed and I put on her headset only to hear my friends talking trash about her.  They were saying things like ""why are girls such try hards"" and ""she's good at gaming but I bet she couldn't make a sandwich"".

Now, they didn't know I was there so I spoke and told them to shut up.  Andre laughed and said they were 'just joking' and I said that's not funny and what if May came back and heard them?  He said it's just 'gamer talk' and I said it wasn't.  Andre told me I was being an ass and dragging down the group.  He also told me they wouldn't be talking smack if I told May to stop trying so hard.  Long story short, after an argument, I kicked Andre out of the wedding.

I turned the PS4 off.  When May asked why it was off, I said the others got off, but I didn't tell her what they said.  Our friends were saying I was overreacting and they didn't mean it, but I honestly don't care.  It just made me so mad.  AITA?  Did I overreact?

Edit:  I do plan to tell May what happened.  This only happened last night, and she's at her moms right now.  I plan to tell her tomorrow.",0
"So, bit of backstory, I have a friend, ""Allison"". Known her close to twenty years now. Due to pandemic and just general life stuff, hadn't seen her in person in a few years. That changed when I ran into her at my local grocery store. She now works there and lives about 4 blocks from me. Onto the issue at hand. A couple days ago a mutual friend of ours was throwing a birthday party for himself and invited a bunch of people over. I went and as a surprise brought Allison along with me as no one expected her to show up, and since we live so close I gave her a ride.

People were happy to see Allison again in person after so many years and she was happy to see them and meet new people there. Later when I was getting ready to leave as I had to work early the next morning, I saw Allison talking with a girl, ""Samantha"". I don't know Samantha all that well, we've been to a couple of board game nights my friend hosted but that's it. Always been polite to each other but not really friends. I approach the two and let Allison know I was leaving and asked if she wanted a ride home or not. She said yes and quickly gathered up her stuff and said goodbye to a few people. 

I noticed that Samantha seemed annoyed/upset but didn't say anything to me, just walked away. I didn't think much of it and Allison and I left. I dropped her off at her place and we made plans to get dinner in a few days. 

Cut to the next day, I am on my lunch break and chatting with friends on a discord server when I get a message from Samantha, she is also on the server, basically screaming at me for ""dragging Allison away"" just as Samantha was apparently about to ask her out. Confused, I respond that I didn't do anything of the sort, just offered her a ride home from the party as I drove her their and she accepted. Samantha then started sending me a more messages calling me an asshole for ruining her chances and accusing me of being jealous. Apparently after we left Samantha had complained to my friends and one of them told her that I had feelings for Allison. While this isn't wrong, its also something I talked with Allison about several years ago, she did not return them, so while they have not fully gone away, I don't really dwell on them or let them affect our friendship.  

I told Samantha she was being ridiculous, that all I did was offer my friend a ride home and nothing more. Samantha didn't like this and demanded I give her Allison number to ""make up for being an ass."" I flat out told her no, I would never just give out someone else's personal information like that without their approval first. Samantha started going off, saying that I am homophobic asshole, and several other people jumped on, agreeing with her that I need to ""do the right thing"" and just give her Allison's number. I told them all to fuck off and logged out. I have since gotten several angry texts from Samantha and others about this.

I don't think I'm in the wrong, but could use some third party judgement here.",0
"My sister just had her first kid. 
I have 2 kids. 6 and 9. 
My mother was never a hands-on grandma, which is completely fine. I learned my lesson early on about asking her to babysit. She would either tell me yes and cancel at the last minute or get mad at me for asking. 

Now, this by itself wouldn't be a huge deal. However, my mother was the kind of mother who would drop us off at our grandparents all the time. Holidays, we would get dropped off the second day off and picked up 3 days before school started. We spend every weekend with them. Grandma would pick us up from school and make us lunch.  And besides that, every time one of us asked her to babysit, she said, ""I already raised my kids. "". Even if we were just asking her to keep an eye on the kid while we hopped to the store. So it really is the hypocrisy that gets me, not her not babysitting. I couldn't care less about that. 

So my sister had her first kid about  4 months ago. We had a family dinner on Friday where everyone got to meet the baby. 

So we were all mingling, and my sister asked mom at one point if she could watch the baby on Friday for one hour so she could pick up her MIL from the airport. My mom started to say her usual sentence, and my brothers and I jumped in and finished the sentence for her and laughed. My brother then offered to watch baby. We thought it was over, but mom was offended and went on a long rant about disrespect.  My sister was confused and said, "" I just thought you might want to bond with your granddaughter,"" to which I said, ""She didn't even raise us. What makes you think she would want to spend time with our kids?"". I admit I was mad. Because she was acting like she was that martyr who never had time  for herself. When she literally never had us and when she did, my older brother and I took care of everything in the house. Including childcare and house stuff.

Obviously, my mother got furious, saying that I was ungrateful. My older brother intervened 
And said that we weren't ungrateful , but we couldn't ignore the matter of fact.


The fight escalated, and my mother stormed off. 
My father called us and told us it was entitled to shame mom for not babysitting. 
Are we the assholes?

Edit: My father is not mentioned because this story is not about him, and it doesn't make sense to talk about him. There is more to the story with him, of course. But this story was about an interaction with us and our mom. The only involvement our father had was the short call at the end. That's why he isn't mentioned much.",0
"So my mom bought box of six I creams on a stick it was like chocolate covered or something. Any way, they sat in the freezer for about three weeks so I asked for one and she said yes. They sat in for like another week so I asked for another one and she got mad. 

Usually my mom will let things sit the the fridge or freezer and not eat it until it goes bad, so I thought I could ask because it was something I wanted. We didn't have snacks and I had dinner and wanted something sweet. Like two days ago I asked for another one and she said just eat it, eat the whole box.

So I ate the whole box. Not in one sitting like over the course of two days there were like three left.

They're were six small ass ice creams, she told me this morning I ate the box with no shame, I was wrong and I owe her seven bucks to buy another one.

AITA?

*EDIT*: I ended up buying some more for her, I should have known not to eat all of it, and this way she'll be happy so it's all good thank you for your advice guys!",0
"Am I the asshole for making this a thing?

Last night- I was checking the weather on my wifes phone. I wasnt snooping, but my phone was plugged in elsewhere so I just grabbed hers.

After I opened the phone, two texts came through from one of my best friends. In short- the first one said he had been drinking. The second one was that it wasnt fun as he was with his wife.

Background:  We all know each other well. My wife is best friends with his wife, I’m best friends with him. We live a substantial distance apart but we go out of our way to see make plans to see each other every summer. They were in our wedding and we in theirs. 

Anyhow- I read these messages, which was weird, as i had sent some texts earlier in the day to him that he hadnt responded to yet, but now he is texting my wife. 

There was no context to the texts as all precious texts had been deleted. I wasnt aware of that my wife and he texted at all. I asked why there were no precious messages, and my wide said it was because she recently updated her phone.  When I showed her that there were messages on this same phone from 2017, she admitted to deleting the messages as she thought id be angry. She said that the extent of their talking was sharing music they liked and funny memes.

This for me would be weird if it was true as neither have ever made mention of the songs or albums they had learned of from one another or shared any of the memes? 

Also- the most recent texts doesn’t align with this being their norm. 

Anyhow- my wife and I had it out. I see it as disrespectful for them to be talking behind out backs, and my wife, at minimum should not be listening to him slag his wife. 

I also sent him a text and said that I saw his messages, and they werent cool by me and that I had to think about whether or not we still could have a friendship. He replied and was apologetic and said that they mostly texted about music. 

Funny- in knowing this  guy for 10 years- he has never had an interest in music beyond listening to whatever is on the radio. 

Am I the asshole for making this into something?

Edits: Thanks for all the feedback. Sorry about the spelling. I wrote this on my phone.

I am literate, I promise. I know the difference between best and beat. 

I’m not concerned about anything physical happening due to distances involved. Flights would be involved in order to cheat. 

I was mostly concerned that I was over stepping by being angry over the texting that had happened quietly. I appreciate the support regarding this!",0
"I'm a mother of a 24 year old daughter ""Christine"", Christine moved back to our hometown after obtaining her college degree and met her current boyfriend Simon (30). I'm not a big fan of Simon but we're civil enough to be around each other.

The other day I called Christine to invite her for lunch and she agreed to come. Unbeknowest to me, she brought Simon with her. I was slightly bothered but only since I was looking for an ordinary mother-daughter lunch to catch up with stuff. I welcomed her and Simon and as far as ordering food, I ordered the usual for Christine but Simon went over the menu and picked many stuff, including a drink. Now this didn't bother me because I figured that he would be paying for this stuff but apparently, this was not the case.

The bill came and I told Simon and Christine that I was only paying for myself and Christine, Simon asked why was that and I told him because I didn't invite him. He let out a loud ""come on now! What?"" And Christine asked if I was serious. I told her yes because I only invited her, didn't I? She said that I was being rude and unwelcoming to Simon after he took the time to drop what he was doing and come join us but I frankly told her this wasn't what I planned. She got offended and said they're both one and I should either pay for both of them or not pay at all, I told her this was not fair to both her and I but she said no this was unfair to !Simon!. I asked if he had money to pay and he shook his head ""no"". I apologized and still stuck to paying for myself and Christine but she refused to let me, saying I either pay for both or not pay at all. I asked if that is what she really wanted and she noded. I said okay then, Paid for myself and left. Clearly Christine had no money as well and they had to wait for a friend to pay for them at the restaurant and Christine was upset about that, she called me and said that I not only disrespected simon and made him feel unwelcome, but I also bailed on them by only paying for myself and leaving them stuck in a horrible situation begging a friend for help. She said she's hurt, Simon's hurt and they expect an apology and the money their friend paid since it's a debt they need to return now. I told her it was her doing for bringing uninvited person with her then insisting that I pay fot them both or not pay at all. She argued that I was trying to avoid responsibility and should make it up to them if I care about our relationship but I said it won't happen because I don't owe them anything.

Things got worse between us, now I'm thinking I might have caused this by not paying for both of them. AITA?",0
"(not sure whether this is actually nsfw but better be safe than sorry)

My boyfriend (23M) and I (18F) have been together for about 3 months now and this is the first time I’ve spent the night over at his flat while I was on my period. 

Since yesterday, I’ve been changing my pads in his bathroom and each time, I wrapped the used pad in a plastic wrapper and put it in the trashcan. The trashcan has a lid and there’s a plastic garbage bag in there, so the pad was touching nothing but the trash that was already inside. 

I genuinely didn’t think it was a big deal, until my boyfriend took out the trash this morning and noticed the plastic wrappers in the bag. He knew they were the packaging for my pads because he had seen them before and quite outraged, he asked whether my used pads were also in that bag. 

I told him yes and he dropped the bag, calling me disgusting and telling me to take out the trash myself.

I did, but then asked him where else I should’ve put my pads and he told me I could’ve just kept them in my purse until I got home. 
I’m staying at his place for three nights because we both have some time off, and I wasn’t going to keep my used pads in my bag for days on end (imagine the smell…).

He stated that he didn’t want my blood all over his trash and that I should find another way to dispose my pads asap.
I don’t think my attempt of an explanation why period blood isn’t as disgusting as the thinks it is got through to him and he’s quite set on his opinion.

I think he was a bit childish because I don’t understand how an adult straight man can be so disgusted by period blood, but when I texted my brother (19M) about it, he sided with my boyfriend.

As I’ve been outnumbered, I wanted to see whether other people also believe what I did was an AH move.

"for context, im having a very small wedding, the venue is capped at 60 people. it will be a few states away, and from the start the one thing i have been adamant on is that i only want people who i am close with to be a part of this. so for the party today, we’re expecting around 20 people. its a time for the ones coming to the wedding to meet and get to know each other a little better. very small, very intimate. 

last night, my friend Alice texted my mom and asked if she can bring her friend Cameron. in the text she made it seem as if saying no was a fine option. Alice’s mom and my mom are best friends as well. Alice and Cameron have been friends for a few months, very adamant that they arent dating (they do sleep together). i have never met him. my mom sent back the following text as response: 

*”Hey!
Thanks so much for checking:)
Will you be upset or your feelings  hurt if I say not for this?
I know OP and OPs fiancé kind of handpicked everyone they wanted to come celebrate with them- those that mean the most to them. I'm sure they would love to meet him at some point, I'm just not sure tomorrow would the best time. If it makes you feel better, I've had to tell 1 other person tomorrow is not the best time to meet someone new, and 2 people that they can't bring their dog (my sister being one!)
OP had a turn of events  today- shes on her way to City to pick up her friend from the airport! We thought she would be here tomorrow, but she came in this evening and will leave Sunday!”* 

now Alice’s mom Karen is furious. Alice is furious. Karen told my mom they had been planning on Cameron being Alice’s plus one at the wedding. but the thing is, i never gave them a plus one. i have a limited number of people, and plus ones just arent going to be feasible. its why we’re doing a lot of stuff in advance to make sure every guest in attendance will know and be friends with someone else there! but yeah. they’re not coming to the party anymore. im angry at how Karen is treating my mom, im pissed they’re acting so childish. 

am i the asshole here, really? i am totally ready to accept it if i am, ive already apologized and said he could come but they still arent coming. im just kind of im shock and need judgements asap",0
"About a month ago my cousin Rose called me, she's the same age as myself, late 30s. We grew up a few states apart and saw each other maybe once every 5 years. We always got along really well but never spent a lot of time together. Now we pretty much talk about once every year or two, and it's usually something I initiate. She called me and told me she was in a bind because She needed about $6,500 for her mother's medical treatment. Rose probably has income that's slightly above mine normally, although I've been unemployed for a few months. The difference is I save, I never go anywhere, I buy day old pastry. I really really curtail spending probably way more than I should. Rose tends to go on a lot of road trips and visit other states just for enjoyment. So I have saved quite a bit. I was thinking I should give it to her out of my savings even though it would be hard to part with but then I thought about how she has gone on vacation out of the country twice within the last 4 years, the last being during the summer. I haven't gotten out of the country for 15 years and not even out of state for eight. She's also bought two puppies this year.

She is furious at me for not helping. Part of me feels like I should. But another part of me knows I would resent it as the only reason I have a savings is because I've done without so many things that she indulges in frequently. And offering to lend her the money wouldn't work as she has borrowed from relatives in the past for other things and never paid them back. AITA?",0
"So I have a distant cousin/relative (cousins daughter whatever that is in relation to me) coming to stay from overseas. I have my own bedroom where I sleep and my study (that happens to have a spare bed).

Originally the plan was to have my (lets say cousin) stay on the couch (by my mothers suggestion actually) to which I thought was a bit harsh, so I suggested we move the guest bed into a spare room (that stores all my mothers clothes). My mum seemed onboard with the idea at the time.

Alternatively my mum suggested I could sleep in the study (with the spare bed) and have my cousin (who I have not seen for over 15yrs) sleep in my bed.

At first I was okay with the idea, but I remembered that I never sleep well in the study with the spare bed. I slept in the study last night and confirmed that it does not bring me good sleep. I'm a sensitive sleeper ig, used to the same bedroom.

So I then told my mum its not going to work and that I think its best we move the bed. To which my mum was okay with, saying it would be a bit more effort but its fine. I then said: ""What do you think I should do? I don't mind too much."" To which she responded: ""Do whatever works best for you"".

It is now the day my mum is going to go get my 'cousin' from the airport. She has given me the cold shoulder all day, being very brief, avoiding me, my dad even said for me to 'keep my distance' from her... As though I did something wrong?

Btw I moved the bed with my father, all she had to do was move some of her spare clothes out of the room which probably took about 1hr30 worth of effort. (she is retired and does not work, I study full-time).

Edit: My mother is back to normal now, haven't spoken to her about it. So I have no idea what was going on that day. 

Also for people that want more info, yes its from having to move a spare bed into a spare room, i.e., making that spare room a guest bedroom. My mother had to move clothes out of said room, and I believe she was upset that ""I"" created more work for her by going with that choice. Thus is why I am asking AITA. Also the guest is staying for a week.

"Hello. Long time lurker. First time poster. My friend told me to post here because when I told her about this she said I was a major asshole.

I (28F) had just finished up loading groceries into my car yesterday evening and was returning from putting my cart back when I saw a man (maybe 30s) approaching with a toddler (3-4M). He said hello and told me he was in a bit of a jam and asked if I could help him out. 

His car wasn't starting and he was trying to get it to work (he pointed to an SUV a row over with its hood up) but his toddler kept running off or yelling in the car. He was wondering if I wouldn't mind keeping an eye on him for a few minutes while he finished up with the car. 

I very much did not want to be on Dateline so I said ""No I'm sorry I can't help you out. Good luck."" The guy looked distraught and said ""Please I really need to get him home and I just need an extra hand for a few minutes."" The kid did indeed look very upset and looked like they had been crying. I was sympathetic but I still repeated that I was sorry but I couldn't help him. 

The man looked even more upset and started almost begging. Little less sympathy now and I said ""Look I told you no. Please back away from my car because I'm leaving.""

My wife's parents are staying with us temporarily as their home is having some serious repairs after a freak accident. It wasn't their fault and luckily they had insurance. The repairs should be completed in two months from now.

I don't really get along with my in-laws, especially my father-in-law, but I agreed to let them stay because I thought the time would fly by and it wouldn't be that bad, but I'm posting here so I guess I was wrong.

My MIL doesn't have a job and my FIL works late shifts until around 11pm. When he gets home they will watch YouTube in the living room and play music on it at a loud volume with our speaker system, it's not ""college house party bass tearing apart the walls"" loud but it is still loud.

My kids are not light sleepers but this wakes them up, then they go wake me up because they want me to make it stop. My kids need to be rested for school and I need to get up in the morning to drop them off and go to work.

My wife works overnight shifts so she doesn't witness this.

I've tried to talk to my MIL and FIL about it and asked that they please keep the noise down after my kids' bed time which is 8:30pm. I don't expect complete silence but I really don't think they need to have the TV on loud late at night.

My FIL argued with me and said that he doesn't finish work til 11pm, so I'm basically expecting him to not do the things he enjoys after work. I told him he can do it before work or on his days off or it's tough shit.

He complained to my wife who's now taking his side and saying that the kids need to learn how to sleep through ""a bit of everyday noise"".

I told her it's not everyday noise and that he and MIL are being excessively noisy and inconsiderate, she's just not there to see it. My FIL has been sending me links to buy earplugs for the kids.

I've gotten really fed up with this. It's not my in-laws' house and they're staying with us as guests and I think they're being really selfish.

I decided to put parental controls on the TV so that my in-laws can't use it after 8:30pm, until 6am the next day. Between those times the TV can't be used without putting in the password and only I know it. This doesn't affect my wife as she doesn't get off work until 6am and isn't normally home until 6:20ish.

My FIL is now incredibly pissed off with me and said that I'm acting like a child and keeps pestering me, demanding the password. My wife is also mad at me for upsetting her dad. 

I'm just so annoyed at this whole situation and I'm sick of hearing about it so I just want to know if I'm morally in the clear.

Edit: thank you for the awards!",0
"Today my BiL and SiL came over with their son, six. Our son, nine, and him played while my wife and I hung out with them. We ended up ordering pizza for dinner. I asked everyone their toppings preferences. Here's what people requested.

My wife and her brother both like that delicious (🤢) white sauce pizza. She wanted spinach and onions. Her brother wanted pepperoni and parmesan. So I ordered a half and half for them. My SiL wanted pepperoni and mushrooms on marinara. I wanted onions and bell peppers on marinara. My nephew wanted pepperoni and parmesan. My son wanted onions and olives.

Here's where I messed up. Instead of getting a pepperoni pizza that was half mushroom and half parmesan and an onion pizza that was half olive and half bell peppers I ordered a pizza that was half what I want and half what SiL wants and a half and half for the boys. I did this because I thought they might eat on the porch while they continued their game and the adults ate inside. So it seemed practical.

When the pizzas arrived my nephew freaked out because there were onions on my son's half. His had no onions, but my nephew said the smell made him sick. Since all three pizzas had onions, he wouldn't eat any pizza and cried. I made him a sandwich, and he sulked until the inlaws left.

My SiL was annoyed with me, and my wife thinks my ""practical"" order was stupid. Was I the ass for how I ordered these pizzas?",0
"I (20f) babysit for some extra cash on the side. This just happened and it's eating me up so here we go. 

So, the family ordered pizza for dinner. Mom left cash on the table for me to pay. It was me, and two boys (7 and 10) large cheese pizza and breadsticks. I have always been under the impression that the babysitter is allowed to have a reasonable amount of dinner if they're expected to serve dinner. I've babysat a few times in the past and have never encountered this.

When the parents came home to relieve me they asked how tonight went. I said fine, and said that the pizza place was really good as I had never ordered from there before. Mom looked at me puzzled, and asked why I ate the kids dinner. I said I just had two pieces of pizza and a breadstick. I feel as if this was not an inappropriate amount to eat. However, the parents disagreed. Dad said that they didn't expect to have to feed me dinner as well, and told me not to eat their family's food. 

Overall, I am very uncomfortable and confused by this experience. Both boys were fed, and did not complain about being hungry for the rest of the night. I personally have always assumed, perhaps wrongly, that if I am expected to serve dinner as a sitter than I am welcome to have a serving. Is this something anyone else has experienced? AITA?",0
"Right so for context, I was hired at 17 under the guise of an apprenticeship but it was basically just an excuse to pay below minimum wage for a factory job as I didn’t go to college and worked a 45+hr week. Even after 3 years they refused to put me or my colleagues on any rate above minimum. I pushed for promotions to get a pay raise but was always brushed off with “I’d like more money too” or “there’s no room for promotion” from the bosses. We was monitored on cameras constantly -waiting for one of us to go on our phones so they had a problem to complain about- and even tried to get our team leader to time our toilet breaks with a stop watch once (he refused). My team and me behind closed doors was called unskilled workers and easily replaceable and that’s why they didn’t want to pay us above minimum. So anyway a few weeks ago my job offer for a decent government job came through I told them I’d be leaving (this was on a Thursday) and that my last day would be Monday. I was taken into a meeting with the boss where he basically said you can’t leave so soon because we have you under contract and no one can use your machine as well as you and it’ll take a long time to train someone to your proficiency and I have to renegotiate my start date non negotiable. So I agreed shook his hand and didn’t show up for work the next day and went for a walk instead.

Am I the asshole?


Edit(some relevant information I thought youse may enjoy): last I heard the manager had to take small assembelly work for his kids to do because they’re so understaffed

Edit 2: they did call me to say something like “are you just not going to show up now” and I replied with “yeh pretty much, that’s me”

Edit 3: just clearing some confusion, they paid me below minimum for the first year while I got qualified even though the qualification was irrelevant to the job role and minimum after I gained the irrelevant qualification.",0
"I'll try to keep things brief but tbh I don't get where my friend is coming from here and I need an outside opinion. So, my parents own a beach house which my friend, Jess (F25), her boyfriend, Harry (M26) and myself (F25) were planning on going to for a week. Our road trip there is coming up in less than two weeks and this morning Jess texted me to ask if her friend, Heather, can come as well. Turns out her friend is going through a breakup and Jess thought bringing her to the beach house would be a good solution to cheer her up. The thing is, the place is pretty small, my parents bought it for themselves and so it's a one bedroom and already as three people the place was going to be pretty cramped with Jess and Harry sleeping in the living room. I told her about this and she said that we can make it work and that Heather can bring her own air mattress and that she won't take up much room. I told Jess I felt as though this might be awkward as I've never met Heather before and she'll basically have to tag along with us everywhere as well as go for the 5 hour road trip. Jess told me that Heather won't be a problem and is very nice.  

I initially reluctantly agreed to this because it didn't seem like Jess would take no for an answer but I guess I gave off the vibe that I wasn't okay with this because Jess went on to ask if I was actually feeling good about this. I told her that honestly having a stranger I never met invited to a trip I've been looking forward to is a real downer on my trip. On top of that, she's going to have to come to everything with us because I only have the one set of keys and I don't want to trust a stranger on her own with the keys. I ended up telling her that ideally, I wouldn't want Heather there but that Jess seemed as though she had already invited her and so we'll make it work. Jess is now mad at me saying that I should have just been upfront and that now things are going to be awkward on our trip and that she can't uninvite Heather. 

I probably could have been more upfront but I feel as though I brought up valid reasons as to why she would be a bad fit on the trip and in general I feel as though it's poor etiquette to try and invite a stranger to someone elses  house at the last minute. ",0
"So this has been a long thing coming. My soon to be husband has a sister let’s call her Mia. Now Mia and I do not click very well. I am polite but I wouldn’t say we are friends. I felt I was forced by his family to make her a bridesmaid or she will be sad. 

I am going to be blunt, Mia is fat and very insecure about it. This has led bridesmaid dresses shopping to be a nightmare. Never could find something she wants and all the other bridesmaid and me liking it. So I gave everyone two options to vote on. Option one was getting a dress that can be styled multiple ways, or picking from a collection so everyone matches but they will need to pay for it. Option two was I will buy everyone’s dress but what I chose the dress and my decision is final.

My five bridesmaids voted and options two won. So I picked out a blue strapless dress with a mini slit. I really like it and I knew Mia would have an issue with it. I sent a picture to all the bridesmaid and confirming the right size before I ordered it.

This is where it blew up. Mia was pissed I picked a revealing dress.  This resulted in an argument where she thinks I am a huge jerk and I told her she can step down if she has issues with the dress.

She tried to get the family on her side but everyone knows I gave them options and had watched me struggle to find something everyone wants.

Edit: she voted for the option where I pay for the dress. I truly didn’t ask her since her and MIL announced she was one of my bridesmaid at a family gathering. The only way to keep peace with the whole family was basically giving her what she wanted.

I also have gone to 4 different shops to find a dress for everyone.",0
"My mom married Mark when I was 7. Mark had Eli (pronounced Ellie) then 5 and Mia then 4.  Eli and Mia were so excited to have a big sister and thought we would be best friends. At first I was kinda like wait, I didn't ask for siblings. I also found it a little too much that they called me their sister straight away and I wasn't ready for it. But eventually I decided it was fine if they felt that way. It didn't mean I needed to. I just needed to be nice (which my mom helped me to understand). Over time I grew to enjoy having them around but then it changed when I realized they didn't just see me as their sister but they truly believed we were best friends. They started wanting matching stuff, they wanted to come everywhere with me, they would get jealous when I was hanging out with my friends. My mom did her best to put a stop to it but Mark said they didn't really remember their life without me so they were going to idolize me a lot and my mom said they should still be okay with me having a life.

I pulled back a lot from them when they started talking about a sister adoption. Which meant they wanted mom and Mark to write these contracts for us to sign saying we would be sisters forever and would always put each other first. I was 13 and they were 11 and 10 at the time. I still saw them as step-sistsers and not just sisters. To me they weren't just my sisters because they weren't my moms kids, and they weren't part of my every day life. They spent time with their mom and I spent time with my dad, so we were apart a lot too.

I really got annoyed when last year Eli broke a necklace my best friend bought me. She was mad that I had told my best friend something I hadn't told her yet and that was her response. The thing I told her was I'm a lesbian. I knew from age 12 which is when I told my best friend, I told my mom a while after but didn't come out to everyone else until last year. Mia was also mad at me for not saying anything and said I should have told them first because that's the stuff sisters share.

Back in June my best friend got a Switch. We both missed out on the Animal Crossing edition so we decided it would be cool to buy stickers and skins for our Switches to make them match and bring Animal Crossing into our lives. I knew it would be a big deal with Eli and Mia but I decided it was worth that to do something with my best friend. The girls were so upset. Mom defended me but Mark said it was callous and was another snub from me toward them and showing them they don't matter to me.

"My brother's wife (K) has a self-diagnosed gluten intolerance. Sometime in college she decided gluten upsets her stomach. To be fair, a good 15% of American's have a gluten intolerance issue so it could be possible. My brother and I developed lactose intolerance when we were in college as well. Since graduating college, my brother has joined the armed forces and moves around every 6 years, and his wife has become a SAHM and refuses to get a job for only 6 years at a time (relevant later).


The issue is, over the years (13ish now), K's treatment of it has progressed to the point where she acts like she has celiac disease. They have separate toasters, silverware, she won’t cook or wash any dishes that have touched gluten (means my brother who works 40-50 hours a week has to come home and cook for their 2 kids, then clean up after), they only eat at GF restaurants, and when you visit you can't bring any food with gluten in the house. My brother is apparently okay to take the kids out for pizza/burgers, but then he has to wash all of their laundry to get the gluten out.

Two years ago at Thanksgiving, K went home crying that night because we didn’t have enough GF options (we had turkey, ham, mashed potatoes, and salad, but in truth had no gluten free deserts because I find gluten free pies, cookies, and cupcakes revolting.) Next year we hosted again, and made sure every dish was gluten free except the stuffing which they offered to bring. I told them just to bring enough for K because everyone else can have real stuffing...but apparently that was offensive too. To top it off, I had set the salad down on the counter 'too close' to the Hawaiian rolls, and she refused to touch the salad for fear of 'cross-contamination'.

Last week, my mom went to visit my brother and his family for the week (5 days) and my brother had the audacity to complain to me that mom eats like a teenager, and only wants junk food (pasta, burgers, hotdogs, nachos, etc.) and went out to eat 3/5 days for dinner. I finally lost it and told him that the reason mom wants to eat out is because we are tired of dealing with this gluten allergy and how they let it run their life. I informed him that mom eats out when she visits because she can’t stand the taste of the food they eat at their house or the ridiculous restrictions they put on an intolerance.

I guess I am wondering, is gluten intolerance really just more severe than lactose intolerance and I'm TA? My brother and I have never made people use separate bowls, pots, pans, cups, dishwasher cycles, due to milk/dairy.  And nothing I find online says anything about separate toasters, ovens, microwaves, dishes for gluten intolerance. I see it everywhere for celiac, but I feel like what started as a GF fad has progressed so far it is just not funny.",0
"UPDATE

&#x200B;

My account was suspended due to some reddit error. Probably because I made a new throwaway and received a lot of attention I messaged reddit and the issue was quickly resolved. So that is why the last post was removed(it's back now). I'm not sure what the rules on updates are here  
  
  
  
  
  
A lot of people wanted an update I wanted to see my roommate in a more positive light. I tend to try to see the best in people but reading the replies and his recent actions have opened my eyes. I never took him too seriously because he's a pretty harmless little guy in my perspective. There is a big difference in how he lashes out at me compared to his gf. He's gotten big tough with me in text form but only mildly upset when I see him in person. I have taken a step back and looked at anything I could have done to provoke him(not excusing his behavior) And while I don't believe I am in the wrong for being hospital and hosting a guest. If a 75 year old man we're staying with us. I would treat him the same as I have treated his gf.  
  
  
  
  
  
I do realize that he is not from the south. I was told by others in school that women outside the south don't enjoy being called ""ma'am."" however, I've never seen a lady get angry if I did call her ma'am up here. I call women of all ages ""dear"" or ""darling"" and I could see how that could be seen as flirtatious even though it's just part of how I speak. Now that he knows I have seen him in his ""true form"" he doesn't even try to act the way he did before. I sent his gf screenshots of the texts he's sent and told her the things he's said. I'm not sure if she is leaving or staying but I've let her know and told her to let me know if she needs any help. I don't plan on moving any time soon as I enjoy having room for a grill and smoker and a garage. He told me he's looking for new places to live and will potentially go back to his parents. I make enough working at a restaurant to afford the rent alone. I would like more going into savings but I'm not worried financially for the time being.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
I am flattered and overwhelmed by all the positive replies. Bout a hundred of you told me to thank my mom so I sure will. I grew up working in hospitality with my mom and siblings. My dad is the one that instilled respect into me. He never felt emasculated even when my mom's business ended up making more than he does. They just save their money from their jobs and go on vacation a lot. Thank you for all the kindness and offers for adoption/jobs/relationships/friendships lol. A lot of people wanting gumbo & chicken recipes. Too much to type out but I use curry powder in a lot of things to give it some good flavor(that's how my mom does it). White pepper is essential for that good good fried chicken flavor

(original post)

I(21m) am from the south. I grew up in New Orleans and Texas. My mom runs a catering business and the majority of clients were either at home in Louisiana or in Texas. I add this to say that I grew up cooking and helping my mom cook for the business. I was frying chicken and catfish when I could reach the stove and making gumbo and buttermilk biscuits at a very young. I'm currently in culinary school right now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I've lived in a rented house on the east coast with my roommate(22m) for a year and a half. He's not a friend or anything. We just linked up because we both needed roommates in the area. He's good to live with and we watch shows and movies together. We hang out and go out for drinks sometimes. I always make friends easy because of being from the south and doing customer service related things since I was a kid. I know how to talk and charm and listen to folk despite being naturally more in the introverted spectrum. My roommate has been seeing his girlfriend(20m) for like 6 months. I've met her before and seen her in passing. Roommate and his gf had a 2 week break from school things. She still lives at her parents so she decided to stay here the whole two weeks.  I was just doing things as I would normally do. It got weird at first when I was about to go mow the lawn and the roommate stopped me and said he wanted to mow(I usually always mow.) A couple of days later I was outside washing my car. I asked both of them if they wanted me to do theirs. She looked like she was going to agree but he looked at her angrily so they declined.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I cook pretty frequently at home as well and usually let my roommate have some. So any time I'd make some I would say that they could have some and this would get him pissed. Weeks prior when she was here and we were all talking. She mentioned this specific kind of cheesecake that she really likes. So I made and sent out a group text that everyone could have it. My roommate got upset. I don't see anything as overstepping a boundary as this is how I treat him and all guests. The other day he told me how annoying it was to hear his gf talk about ""how good your roommate can fresh baked bread is."" I'm not trying to make him look bad or anything. This is simply how i was raised. If I bake two loaves of bread I'm gonna leave it out for the house to eat.

&#x200B;

EDIT- The cheesecake is just common courtesy type thing to me. When his parents come over i make pound cake because they like it. If a guest is coming you get/make what they like. Nothing odd about picking up their favorite chips or making some tea when guests arrive. Just how I was raised

&#x200B;

EDIT- Wow this has blown up. Just want to say we generally have a good roommate relationship. We're not best friends but it's friendly enough. The only change has been when his gf is here. So lol no I am not looking to for new roommates/to be adopted/or to move but thanks. Here is some more things that upset him.

&#x200B;

I went to the grocery store and asked if anyone needed anything

&#x200B;

I was frying chicken and offered the first/best pieces out the oil to them

&#x200B;

I changed the oil to my own car

&#x200B;

I used a smoker in the backyard to make brisket

&#x200B;

I grill and smoke in the backyard and needed a piece of wood cut into a certain way to hold something up. I cut and nailed some wood together in the garage.

&#x200B;

Feels like I can't even exist while she is here

&#x200B;

FINAL EDIT- I tend to see the good and best in people. So I was not seeing him as being very insecure and was trying to look at this in a more positive light. But he just texted me and said that I  greet his gf in too kind of a way and it's annoying that I say ""be safe"" when she leaves the house(I say this to him and everyone when they they tell me they are going somewhere). He sent me a long text detailing it's bad that I look her in the eyes when she is talking to me??? Maybe it is time for a new roommate

"My half sister has a weird obsession with me. She stalks me on my social media profile and acts like a deranged ex. I'm pretty popular on Instagram, where I also post my art, so making it private is not an option. 

She is 17, and I haven't seen her in  years. The last time I saw her, she was 12 and it was at my grandfather's funeral. 

My biological father had an affair with one of my mum's friends when she was dying. It was sick and my poor mum found out about it 5 days before she passed away. The other woman was already pregnant with my half sister. 

I was 15 and old enough to know what that meant. I refused to live with my dad (courts allowed it) and started living with my maternal grandparents. My 2 older siblings were in college and they haven't talked to him in years. 

We chose to keep them out of my life and we like it that way. 

Whenever I, my husband or my siblings make any sweet post, she literally spams the comments section with comments about us abandoning her and our biological father. 

I keep blocking her, but she comes back with new IDs every time. I definitely think she is not in a good mental place, and needs help. Possibly professional help. 

The last straw was on mothers day, when I tried to post a beautiful tribute to my mom. I posted many pictures. Some of those pictures were beautiful family pictures and I edited my biological father out of them. 

She commented about me posting edited pics and abandoning our father. It was a long post, and she actually posted several old family pictures in her account. That post got a lot of attention, and people started asking me about it. 

Only this time, I didn't delete her comment or block her. I replied under her post and asked her to stay away from my life. All this time, I avoided a confrontation because I believed she was young and misled by her parents. But as a 17 year old, she should know better. 




This was my reply :

 "" I don't know about others, but for me and my siblings, just because our biological father decided to have sex with some rando, and cheat on our dying mum, doesn't mean we owe anything to him or the result of his indiscretions. Please respect our boundaries and leave my family alone. You are old enough to understand this and if it bothers you, consider therapy. This level of obsession with our lives is really unhealthy. I wish you and your family well. ""

"My friend moved into a new apartment a few days ago and had a little housewarming party. Most of us were pretty drunk by the end of the night and unfortunately I am very clumsy when intoxicated. Long story short, I tripped and fell right into her brand new TV. It was completely broken, and obviously I was very embarassed and apologized a thousand times and promised I would pay for it.

Sober the next day, I texted her and ask what kind of TV it was and where she got it. Then I looked it up online and it had a valentines day sale on it, 80 bucks cheaper than what she originally paid. Before I could even tell her about that she messaged me and told me I can just paypal her the money and she'll go to the store today and pick it up. But she named the price she paid, not the new one. I showed her the new price but she said that's not what she paid, she should get the full price back. I was free that day so I tried to offer to drive us there, buy it and help her carry it up, since she doesn't have a car anyway.

But she insists I just send her the full amount since thats what I owe her because I said I would pay for it, sale or not. I don't think that's fair, she'll have exactly the same TV as before, why do I need to give her an additional 80 bucks?

Update; We've come to a resolution, The reason she wanted the full price was because she had borrowed the money for it from someone and was hoping to just pay them back instead of getting a new TV altogether. So I'm paying her in full. I'm fine with that I just didn't see a point in paying her more than what she needs to actually replace the TV.

At this point I also don't really care anymore. In the spirit of friendship I'm making this as easy as possible",0
"My wife likes to have a window open (2-3 in) in the bedroom for fresh air. Many times it doesn’t bother me however tonight its like 30 degrees outside. I got a wood stove burning to keep it warm but it was still 67 in the hallway and kids rooms are colder. Also the on suite bathroom window is open (8-10 in) causing a slight cross breeze in the bedroom. Furnace is off now since i don’t want it to turn on when windows are open. The forced air causes even more cross breeze but then through the house. I am having to feed the wood stove more to keep home from dipping to mid to lower 60s. I can feel the difference of colder air from our bedroom. Also she likes the bedroom door open at night to hear our young kids. She also argued the wood stove stinks, i stink and she is hot. Personal i feel they are arguing points because if i didnt run wood stove and used only the furnace and i showered before bed every night she’d still want the windows open. Am i crazy for wanting the window closed or bedroom door closed to keep the rest of the house warm? ",0
"So I(29M) live with 2 roommates, Olive 28F and Sam 30M. We're in college, met in college, and decided to rent a house together because we got along. It's a  2 floor, 2 loving room and kitchen, and 3 bed two bath and me and Sam share the upstairs bathroom as Olive is a neatfreak and cleans bi weekly and we only clean once a week. She's in the basement by choice as she prefers her own area. Me and Sam separated chores by I tidy, he takes care of cats(we each have one which is also why olive is in the basement. She loves cats but is too allergic to be near them and she knew abt cats before agreeing to rent)
 we split dishes and cooking. I cooked last week which meant he was on dishes and since I cooked lasagna which he and olive both wanted(if it's a lot of food and is safe for her we invite her to come eat too but she has a gluten allergy so cooks in her kitchen) if olive really wants a certain food she'll ask us to make it if she doesn't have the energy and vice versa. Sam is usually good about doing dishes and is a good roomate for the most part but his room can get gross and he tends to dirty the whole house if he's tired. I went to go tidy after we ate and he asked if he could do the dishes tomorrow and I said yes. The next day we ordered out but he still didn't do the dishes. I offered just to do them but he refused saying he'd get to it.(note, he doesn't struggle with ADHD or depression but was raised not doing chores so he does this sometimes) he didn't do it. 
 He didn't do it the next day either despite constant reminders. He also neglected the cats and I did their boxes lately and fed them. Olive came home today, saw mold in the dish and promtly vomited. I walked out of my room and looked in the dish and gagged. Sam came out, saw it, and said we were overreacting and that he'd do the dishes after I cooked dinner as I have for the past few days. I yelled at him for being a pig, being lazy, and causing mold in the house and neglecting the poor cats causing me to do most of the chores. Olive said she's going to call our landlord to get Sam out of the house if he doesn't start cleaning on a regular basis as this is nasty. Sam flipped us off and has locked himself in his room. Me and olive split the dishes on the condition that I make her dinner for 3 days not counting today. I made us all salads per olive's request and some gluten free pasta. Sam told me to F off when I offered him some. It's now 10pm and I worry that we were too hard so Reddit, AITA? ",0
"I (22F) have been with fiancé (24M) for 6.5 years since we were 15&17. We get married this August. His family tree is a little complicated but necessary to understand a little about what’s going on. 

MIL has 4 kids with 3 guys (not trying to make her sound bad). Fiancé is oldest and has never met his dad. SIL is second and my age, her parents shared custody would visit dad on holidays and summers. Youngest boys belong to FIL who also adopted fiancé. SIL dad was abusive towards MIL and fiancé while they lived with him, her dad was always good to her though. FIL is air force and got restationed to another state which is why visiting would only happen on school breaks. MIL & FIL we’re strict and conservative SIL dad would let her do whatever she wants. 

Right as fiancé and I started dating, SIL from dads place sends letter to court basically saying how horrible MIL & FIL (mostly FIL) are towards her and that she wants to stay with her dad and requests emergency custody. All of this was made up because she was allowed to do whatever she wanted with him and she was 15 what 15yo doesn’t want to do what they want? She stays with her dad and obviously MIL & FIL are at risk for losing BILs due to accusations. 
I am there to witness all of the emotional fallout SIL left behind and I really helped younger boys through it (11&8 at time) as kind of surrogate sister almost? While her actions didn’t get them removed she never once took her siblings into consideration. 

MIL & SIL end up repairing relationship years down the road. Fiancé has forgiven her but has made it clear that he wants no relationship if she won’t a) admit it was all a lie & b) take responsibility for pain she caused. She denies she did anything wrong and now whole situation is kind of taboo to discuss. 

Current issue: I was discussing guest list with MIL and made a comment “x,y&z will be there and I haven’t spoken with fiancé regarding if we are inviting SIL or not” she immediately snapped back with “she’ll be there” like we had not say in it? I moved on because I didn’t want to cause an issue but she kept making comments like that and that she’s “not going to exclude her” I had enough and told her that it is not her job to “include” her in the celebration of fiancé and I’s relationship that SIL has never expressed interest in being a part of. I told MIL that I have no issue with her coming but there needs to be a relationship with at least one of us first as SIL would be only one at wedding with no relationship with either of us. 

MIL was very upset and will only communicate to me through fiancé.  
AITA?

EDIT: everyone seems to think I don’t want her invited. That’s not it at all, my fiancé is neutral on it and as long as no drama is caused day of I don’t care if she’s there. The issue is that MIL keeps pushing it on us and making it seem like we never had a choice to begin with. I feel that fiancé (who has no relationship with SIL) has the healthiest relationship with her because he’s the only one asking her to recognize her actions were wrong and then he will be ready for a relationship. MIL was just desperate to get her back in her life and ignored all past wrongs which is so unhealthy. 

EDIT: fiancé knows about this call and doesn’t think I did anything wrong, I guess what upset MIL most was HOW I said it. I’m one of those people that will cry when they’re frustrated or angry making it so much harder to be taken seriously when you’re communicating why you’re upset (mostly because I hate causing or being a part of conflict so much). I was extremely careful to maintain a clear kinda monotone voice and attempt to distance myself emotionally so I wouldn’t make it all worse by breaking into tears. This was also all over the phone as fiancé and I live in different state from MIL",0
"Final Update: Thank you all for all the awards and comments. I’m known to be a huge pushover, and my friend knows this to be true and she can be pretty manipulative and caused me to second guess myself. She also still isn’t talking to me, which is fine by me. As for the package, our mutual friend found the box it was supposed to be shipped in by the trash in front of her house so I guess she’s not shipping it anymore. I don’t know what was in it, but all evidence and other context which is too long to post points to it being a “substance”. At This point, I’m hoping that it was just weed and not something more dangerous. Once again, thank you everyone! 

I will soon be flying to the other side of the world, and my friend asked me to take a package with me and deliver it to her friend who lives in the country I am flying to. 

Now, I trust my friend with my life, but I told her that since it’s an international flight and taking unneeded risks are unwise, I would appreciate it if I can open the package, with her present, and look through it just to make sure there’s nothing “undesirable” in it. 

My friend immediately gets offended, and she even starts yelling at me, telling me how she can’t believe that I don’t trust her, and that I am invading her privacy. She told me I’m being selfish and paranoid, and that she won’t let me see inside the package because it has “sensitive content”. That ended up freaking me out more so I told her that I can’t do it if I can’t make sure it’s safe, and that I’m sorry. 

She started to cry and left the room. She later left me a text saying I’m selfish and that she doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. While I feel bad, I have heard all kinds of stories and I don’t want to put into a position where I am responsible for whatever “sensitive content” in her package. 

Reddit, AITA?

Edit1: a comment here made me want to add more context. I trust my friend a lot, but I should mention that my friend is known to cultivate weed and then store them in spice jars. I could have sworn I heard noises of glass in the package and she has joked before that she could smuggle weed disguised as a spice or herb or something and that “they wouldn’t know a thing”. I do trust her, but I just want peace of mind you know. I’m sad she’s offended but I just wish she could understand my POV

Edit2: Wow! I woke up to so much engagement in this post! Thank you all for your replies and assuring me I’m NTA! And thanks for the awards! As for updates, my friend hasn’t spoken to me since the incident and has had a message delivered to me via mutual friend saying the only way she’ll talk to me is if I take this package from her, and “trust in our friendship”. However, I heard from my other friend that the person I was supposed to deliver the package to has a reputation involving drugs, and while we didn’t get into details my friend just said “and not for using them”. I don’t want to accuse anyone of anything, rumors fly and innocent until proven guilty, but I am definitely not taking that package anymore, unless I can get a pretty good look at it.

Edit3: I just saw a comment asking me if I know a Jason who stores Olives in his fridge, I replied this to them: “Sorry for replying late! Funny enough, her boyfriends name is Jason! Fun fact to enhance this story, he loves a show called breaking bad so bad that he legally gave himself the middle name Walter! But sadly I do not know if they keep their olives refrigerated.” 

I just read the story in question about Jason and his refrigerated olives, there may be a connection! But then again, most likely not. I’ll try my best to do some digging (but if I’m being honest, I’m kind of freaked out enough by the situation to avoid “investigating” anything for my own safety) and I’ll update this story as long as you guys are interested! Once again thank you all!",0
"For context we both work full time (same company) and have a daughter. 

AITA for telling my husband that he needs to stop playing video games during all his free time? 

I (25yr) WFH 3-4 days out of the week. For a couple of months already my husband (30yr)when he works from home is glued to his desk and wont help with our daughter unless I ask him to do something. So when we both WFH I am the one trying to balance getting my little one ready , household chores , making 3 meals a day all while I’m still finding time to prioritize my work. It’s simply exhausting. Lately every time I see him at his desk he will be playing video games for almost an hour and justify it as “he’s working.” Today was my breaking point, I was putting my little one down for a nap during a meeting she wouldn’t go to sleep til 30 mins after, and finally on my lunch break i decide to take care of a load of laundry. As I’m eating lunch and doing laundry at the same time I look over and there he is again playing video games. I had enough so I said ,”I’m getting tired of all you do during your free time is playing video games.” This turned into an argument and basically said he can do whatever he wants during his free time & I can’t tell him what he should do during that time. He then proceeded to say that I act like I do stuff all the time and I try to victimize myself and then asked me to breakdown “everything I do.” I was over the argument at that point and said I was done and if he couldn’t take a step back and try to comprehend where I was coming from then there was no point to continue the conversation. He continued going and said “I need to learn how to be an adult, cuz I’m “attacking him.” And then decided to make comments like “I’m scared to go to my desk now, am I allowed to even work at this point?” “I should just get rid of my desk and just go to the office everyday now.” I ended up waking away and crying and now typing this cuz I’m so mentally drained trying to be understood. So I just really need help to see if I’m truly the problem at this point? Am I the asshole? ",0
"So I (28F) have a grandma who is pretty judgmental/critical about things.  
My brother Dean (25M) is marrying his girlfriend Sonia (23F).  
In the family we all fell in love with Sonia from the start except my grandma who keeps saying stuff like ""Well she seems nice but you never know what these girls can be hiding"" or, ""They seem in love but who knows if it's just an act"", or ""She's very pretty, your brother was probably blinded by that"" etc you get it.

Anyway yesterday my grandma heard from my dad that the couple are having a hard time choosing a venue. She texted me (I am the oldest grandchild so my grandma tends to vent to me) saying ""You see...trouble in paradise. Problems finding a venue is just the first step, maybe they're not meant for each other""  
This really pissed me off because really she needs to get off their case they did nothing to deserve this, so I angrily text back ""WTF since when does trouble planning a wedding indicate marital troubles, i don't know a single couple whose wedding planning went all smooth sailing. Planning a wedding is stressful""  
Grandma: ""The fact that your brother is so involved in the planning is already a warning sign. The bride plans the wedding everyone knows that, it's the rule""  
Me: ""Grandma its 2024 couples plan the wedding together as a couple, my brother has an idea of what he wants and he deserves to take part in the planning of his own wedding too - they make their own rules""  
Grandma: ""No, that's the way it is, the bride plans the wedding the groom grants her wishes to make her happy and doesn't get involved. Their bad attitude will ruin their relationship""  
Me: ""They will be absolutely fine and the only one with bad attitudes ruining relationships now is you, keep acting this way and they will keep away from you and then don't come to me complaining that your grandkids stay away from you""

My grandma stopped answering and told my dad and now he says i'm an AH for being so harsh with her especially since Dean and Sonia didn't even hear of this (and we've all done our best for Sonia not to feel my grandma's judgement, hope it's working) but TBH im just sick and tired of all her crapping on Sonia for no reason.  
So reddit, aita? should i apoogize like my dad said?",0
"I spent six years in prison and I have been out eight. 

When I was in prison, I met a man, Scott, who had already been in there for 15 years. He was very much respected by most of the prison and almost everybody left him alone. 

For some reason, he ended up taking a liking to me and he helped me navigate the prison scene and gave me some really good advice on how to stay out of trouble. He essentially became the father that I never really had, without sounding too corny. 

The prison that I was in was super rough and without his advice I don’t know that I would’ve made it out. 

He got out just before I did. 

When I got out I got my shit together and eventually met my now wife. We have a son together who is now four. 

I heard last week that Scott has passed away. I was super upset and knew that I had to go to his funeral to pay my respects. I confirmed with Scott’s daughter (who I’ve met before) that it was okay if I attended (due to Covid restrictions only a certain number of people can attend).

My wife of course knows about my time in prison and Scott. 

I told her that he had died and that I was planning on going to his funeral.

She got upset with me and told me that I have a family how and that I should be focusing on my family not people I knew in prison. 

I told her I wouldn’t be here without Scott helping me but she refused to agree with me. 

AITA for planning to go to the funeral?",0
"I (23 F) & my bf (25 M) live with his dad & new family, temporarily. Recently we had to use my F-I-L (late 40s) car to pick him up 2 hours away. On the way back, F-I-L drove the car but about an hour to home, his engine blew. We ended up having to be towed back. Here’s the situation. Today my F-I-L asked to borrow my car since my bfs took his own car to work.

Some background: I was without a car for a little over a year after an accident I had. In that time I had to use my bfs car & so did his cousin. I just got a car LAST month. Since my car is old I can only have liability & currently it has some issues (check engine light on bc of 2 O2 sensors needed & desperate need of a tune up).

Back to the story.. so I did let F-I-L use my car since he was only going to the store to grab one thing, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t nervous since (again) I just got this car & I’m extremely worried about letting anyone use it.. not to mention I still don’t know F-I-L v well (though polite, I’m very shy & F-I-L isn’t wandering around the house too often). So I called my bf just to talk & briefly mentioned that his dad took my car. He stated that his dad will probably get an Uber for work but if not I should let his dad use my car (bf gets out of work the same time his father & I go in but we all work at different places). We got into a back and forth because aside from my car having problems & me barely knowing his dad, I just simply don’t feel comfortable letting anyone else use my car for long periods of time. Also that I feel since it’s my BF’S family it’s ultimately HIS OWN responsibility. Not to say I won’t let his dad use my car to run little errands but if the roles were reversed, i may be as annoyed as he that I would once again have to let someone else use my car but in no way would I offer up my PARTNERS car to MY parent. The worst & most bothersome part of it all is that my bf threatened our relationship over this by saying “whatever, I’m about to just leave I have one foot out the door anyway.” Which to me is just completely childish.

I don’t want to seem selfish & now I’m starting to feel like I sort of am but again, if it was my family I would take on that responsibility so I gotta ask, am I really the asshole?",0
"My boyfriend and I have been dating for about three months. We both love each other very much and I see a future with him. He immigrated to my home country about three years ago and is on a student visa, meaning that he has to pay exorbitant visa fees and full-fee student fees. His parents do not financially support him. I’ve always admired and respected his ambitions.

He was recently talking to me about money problems, and basically asked if I could loan him $5000. I’m extremely protective over my money as I work/study 24/7 to maintain my savings. Furthermore, my dad is planning to soon retire from the workforce after a heart attack, so I like having my savings as security knowing that I could financially support him if needed. My boyfriend knows that I have about $55k saved up and he also knows that I don’t pay too many living expenses besides fuel, groceries, and a phone bill. 

I told him that I wasn’t comfortable loaning him money this early in the relationship. He then flipped the conversation on me, getting angry at me because I’m planning on getting a breast augmentation which will cost me ~$10k next year. He called me selfish for spending money on my body rather than him.

AITA?",0
"I'm 19f and live at home with my family. My younger brother 'Mike' is 14. He is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that's what they're doing most of the time. The boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their parents are hella weird. They have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. My mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like ""I saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago"" ""They were in our garden 5 minutes ago I think now they're headed to the skate park"". I think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.

One of the moms in the chat is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'Jake' is there. We once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won't respond.
 
Now yesterday I was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. Jakes mom had called my phone two times but I didn't answer cause she was annoying me. My boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. We were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. It was all nice and peaceful and suddenly I hear a really loud knock. It really made us jump because it was just so sudden. I turn to look and there's Jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. I nearly hit the ceiling I was so angry. I go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt I just wanted to ask because I haven't seen Jake in almost two hours ect.ect. Apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. I really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. I also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.

My boyfriend thought I was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other parents are now blowing up her phone. She also thinks I shouldn't have said that stuff about the divorce.  I feel sorry for putting my mom in this position but I feel like someone needed to tell that lady how annoying her behavior is.",0
"I (36F) have been friends with a guy (48M), we will call him Rob, for years. He’s a very wealthy and successful guy, does very well for himself, and has no kids, never been married before, etc. He is a serial dater and his goal is to date the hottest girls he can. He spends sometimes thousands on them every week in buying them gifts, dinners, and straight up giving them cash.  It’s his thing and one of the ways he likes to spend his money. Whatever floats his boat, his life, his money, I don’t judge and if he’s happy then I’m happy for him. 

However, recently, he went through an awful breakup that sent him spiraling and I was there every day and night to talk to him on the phone, offer him advice, read his sometimes over a hundred messages a day and otherwise console him. We’re talking hours every day that I was spending on him and it went on for weeks. Quite honestly, it was exhausting after awhile and there was definitely a lot of trauma dumping going on. I am a single mom who works full time and I don’t always have a lot of free time or mental energy but I did my best to support him. He recently invited me out to dinner saying that he “owes me” for all of the support I’ve given him, so we went out to a really nice restaurant and had a nice dinner, until the end.

The check arrived and he stated “Alright, we’re splitting this thing.” I was shocked, as he wanted this dinner and invited me! When I questioned him and also informed him that I had to pay $100+ to a babysitter to be able to go out with him, he insisted that he’s not paying for me, that we are just friends. I’m able to support myself and my kids obviously but going out is a treat because of how costly everything gets, $100 is a lot for me.

I sent him my half and left shortly after, somewhat upset, as I felt blindsided by this and also felt that he should’ve treated, given the fact that he invited me and also because he makes exponentially more than me and knows my struggles sometimes as a single mom. AITA for being upset with him? Would love some insight before I confront him.

tl/dr: Wealthy friend made me pay half of the expensive dinner bill even though he invited me to the dinner and he knows what a financial burden it is for me to go out. AITA for being upset?

Edit: Thank you for all of the great replies. I really appreciate all of the insight!! Just wanted to clarify a few things:

1.) I have no romantic interest in this guy. Zero. I’m not jilted and upset nor do I have some fantasy that he will be with me. It’s just not like that with him.

2.) For the people saying that nobody owes me a dinner just because they make more money, you are absolutely right. However, if I had a friend or family member in a tight financial situation and I had the means to pay, I would feel horrible taking money from them. ",0
"

My husband (m33)s best friend (m37) Will is infertile. He got divorced 2 times because of it and because he lied and hid his infertility. And his life hasn't been the same the day he was told he can't have kids. He has always had a soft spot for children and when he found out that my husband and I are expecting, he was so thrilled and started buying us gifts and decore pieces that he made from his woodwork for the baby. My husband thinks that those are all nice gestures but I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable especially with how much he keeps mentioing the baby.


A few days ago, my husband and I found the gender of the baby. The minute we told Will, he started calling the baby a random name he picked and was going to give to his baby if he wasn't infertile. He then started begging us to use this name and my husband said it was a ""done deal"". I refused but my husband called me heartless and asked me to do this one small, nice gesture for his struggling friend to give him closure and honor him after all the things he has done for us. I flipped and said it's my baby not his. Will heard this and left immediately. My husband yelled at me saying it's his baby too and my behavior towards Will was abhorant. He left after him and didn't come back til the morning. He kept saying the same thing and pressuring me to agree on the name but I refused.


AITA for choosing this hill to die on?",0
"I am 18F and in my last year of highschool which is a very important and very stressful time. I have loads of school work to do but it seems like that doesn't matter to my family. I live with my grandmother and my little sister and sometimes my mom and my baby brother visit (weird dysfunctional dynamic, don't ask) and I am considered the only person who can do chores and be sent around for simple things. 

For example I do the dishes everyday and twice a day on weekends (no dishwasher) I am expected to sweep and mop the house on weekends, I do all the laundry, sometimes I am expected to cook and other times I have to clean the bathroom, including the shower as well, I also have to give my little sister a bath sometimes. My mom and grandma will also call me multiple times throughout the day to do simple things like making them coffee or tea with bread and snacks, getting them water, throwing away diapers, warming up the baby's milk, helping my little sister with her homework, folding their laundry and other things. Not to mention the things I need to do for myself everyday such as cleaning my room, ironing my uniform, polishing my school shoes, etc. 

I get up at 5am and get home at 4pm everyday. I feel overwhelmed and over worked and everytime I try to argue this with them they say I'm being dramatic and weak and that everyone my age is doing more than I'm doing and still doing better than me at school. I can't focus or studying for long amounts of time because they will constantly scream my name to send me to do things for them but at the same time they expect that I will be top of my class. I don't know, maybe I am overreacting. 

Am I the asshole in this situation?",0
"My fiancé (m23) and I (f21) have been together for eight years. During the Christmas holidays he took me on a trip to Aspen and he proposed to me. Clearly we're on cloud nine with this huge milestone in our lives, so like I'm thinking if maybe what I'm doing is wrong/ staining something that should be a happy memory.

The thing is that my fiancé has a sister (my same age) we went to school together, but we weren't friends. When my fiancé and I started dating, for some reason she started spreading lies about me like saying I was bullying her at school or spreading rumours about me and her brother. She claims that she wasn't the one to say those things, but I know it was her. 

So yeah, we never really had a good/ close relationship and I can say that it has impacted my fiance's relationship with her as well. 

Now I have to choose those who will help me with my bridal party/ wedding planning. I got my own sister, one of my cousins, some friends and my fiance's other little sister (18) as bridesmaids, but I actively excluded his other sister. 

When she found out about it she said she's sick of me always being so petty and such a drama queen. I told her that she'll get an invitation for our wedding, but that tbh I don't want to spend more time than necessary with her, I am not close to her and I have no desire to make her a bridesmaid. She said that I'm acting immature because this is stuff that supposedly happened when we were in school, and she said again that she didn't and I never bothered to ask for her side. I told her whatever, it's my wedding and I can do whatever I want along other things

Some people didn't like my response either. But what actually has me wondering if I was an asshole here is because I was thinking about it. I am an adult and I'm ready to take a big step like marriage with my fiancé, but she called me immature and it kinda stayed with me you know? I'm wondering if it's time to be ""the bigger person"" and start over, which would make my decision here immature and asshole like. She's always going to be my husband's sister, my children's aunt, we'll be an official family now, so I don't know exactly what the saying is, but it's like extend an olive branch? 

However, I also feel entitled to have those who I truly want as my bridesmaids, I feel that's my right as I'll only get married once and I want it to be perfect for me, and that vision of ""perfect"" doesn't include her as a bridesmaid. Sooo, please give me your opinion

Edit for clarification: the rumours she started about were not just when we were 13, it was all throughout our school years until we graduated 

Yes, my fiancé agrees with me on this because he also isn't close with his sister.

I am close with his little sister, that's why she's a bridesmaid 

She accused me of bullying her BEFORE any of the rumours started, her parents went to our school to talk with our teachers and they told them that I wasn't bullying their daughter, she was just lying for some reason

Another edit because I've seen this is a common theme amongst comments: I would love for my wedding day to be ""perfect"" (I know that perfect doesn't really exist, but the closest to it at least) because this is going to be one of my happiest memories, but I understand this is just one day and what's important is marriage. That is why I was wondering if extending the ""olive branch"" was the right move here because I could make sure (or at least do my part) to have a good relationship with my SIL for the rest of our lives",0
"I won't complicate this. I have a daughter Cara who is not my biological daughter, nor was she my legal daughter until she reached the age of 18 when she asked me to adopt her as an adult. I married my husband when she was 14 and together we have two children. Cara gets along okay with my husband. But admittedly her upbringing means she was maybe not as able to bond with a father figure as she was with a mother figure and her age was also a factor. Regardless, everyone gets along and I think that is the best you expect when you have someone who went through as much as she did at a young age.

Cara is engaged and came to me recently and told me she would like to walk with me down the aisle and do a dance with me while her fiance dances with his mom.  She told me she didn't know how to ask for that without hurting my husband. I told her he would understand and I would be honored to do it.

I did not expect my husband and his parents to take offence. They believe she snubbed my husband and is making it seem like he's nothing. After listening to them complain about this for ten minutes I told them to suck it up and accept that she asked me, her mom, to do both of those parts of the wedding and that I was proud to do it. I dared them to tell me I was less deserving than my husband.

My husband and his parents believe I wasn't very understanding (and downright rude!!! according to my MIL).

AITA?

So to clarify for people because I was not clear. My husband is not her father, he is her stepfather through me. I was married before and she was my stepdaughter who I ended up with custody of but never legally adopted as a minor because her biological mother was alive. She has trauma relating to father figures (two prior ones to be exact) so she has never really considered my husband as such but their relationship has been good considering everything she has been through.

I did adopt her when she turned 18. Not my husband, just me.

Adding some more to this. Had my husband confided in me that his feelings were hurt that would be one thing. But he did not. He went to his parents and then all three decided to take offence to the fact not only was he not asked but I was. And while they never came out directly and told me that I should say no it was implied throughout their complaints. None of which were about his hurt feelings and all about the ""snub"" and how unbelievable it was that I would be filling that role in her wedding.",0
"I (f 29) was raised in a Christian household. With that came gender roles that were ingrained in me at a young age. My granddad however hated that my parents taught us this way and as I got older I did too. Because of this I became very close with my grandparents instead of my own parents. I also have an older brother that my parents labeled “ the second king of the house”. For more info( important) my grandparents lived in a beautiful house that had no neighbors, many trees, and a garden. They payed off the house after years and was very special to them. My granddad also had bad problems with his back and a condition that would get worse until he couldn’t go on anymore. After my grandmother passed he got worse and ended up needing at home care. He didn’t want a stranger in his home so that wasn’t an option ( I think it was due to my grandmother passing). My parents preached that it was punishment for all his sins so they wouldn’t take care of him and were planning on putting him in a home. I decided to stay with him since it would just be easier, my job can be worked effectively at home and he’d get care from someone who isn’t a total stranger. In the time I took care of him we filled the home with the love and laughter my grandmother brought to it. As my granddad got worse not a single call. Not from my mom, or dad, or my brother. We were joking about it once and he said “ maybe I should just give you missy( the houses name lol) instead of your dad, he’s just gonna give it to your brother anyway” he laughed after he said that so I assumed he was joking. Fast forward, the worst happened. I was the one who found him. Had to make the call. All of it. As much as I was pushed away from my parents I didn’t want them to find out the news from a random person. The funeral was the first time I ever truly connected with my parents in years. We hugged and cried together and we were all vulnerable. But then it came time for the will. Now it wasn’t some telenovela with all the dramatics but it was intense. The house that was supposed to be my dad’s became mine as well as many other things that my dad planned on giving to my brother. I was accused of manipulating my granddad into giving it to me and my brother was just yelling. A week after my brother came to the house in tears. He was begging me to give him the house since his was too small for his wife and baby. He argued that because it’s just me and my husband and we don’t want kids I don’t need it. I told him to leave and felt horrible. I feel like an asshole and so does my family. He’s right I don’t need the house, my job pays me good money and I could easily just live somewhere else. On the other hand though my granddad wouldn’t want him OR my dad to have it. I am at a loss here. AITA?",0
"3 Months ago my best friend came over to my place and we were having dinner with my sister. My sister mentioned how she wants to hit the gym and pay more attention on what she eats because she wants to lose a bit of weight for health and aesthetic reasons. My friend then said to her that she doesnt need to lose weight at all and need to accept herself how she is and that she is beautiful as she is and she shouldnt lose weight for anybody, especially guys. I then told my friend its okay, if she wants to make this decision then its her decision and I totally support this decision that my sister chooses to actively improve her health and I also dont see anything wrong in her wanting to change her aesthetics with sport. My friend then said that I basically said that my sister would be prettier if she loses the weight and in general that being „bigger“ or have a belly is ugly and low key accused me of being fat-phobic. She said I should accept my sister how she is , doesnt matter how she looked and even if she is much bigger than she is now. I told her that I dont have anything against bigger people and objectively I find a slimmer figure nicer than a bigger one, but it doesnt mean I am fat-phobic. Thats my preference. Also my sister is primarily doing it for health reasons and its not like she is skinny obessed or something. Conclusion for her: I think bigger people are ugly and I am semi fat-phobic.

Fast forwards yesterday: My friend complained about her bloated stomach and in general her stomach and told me she thinks she gained weight so she will pay more attention to what she eats to lose the weight. I basically called her out because she made a shitstorm 3 months ago at my dinner table and accusing me of being fat-phobic because I support my sisters decision of going to the gym and eat healthier and now she wants to lose weight because she gained. By her theory she shouldnt do anything about it and accept her body how it is or else she thinks gaining weight is ugly and is a fat-phobic herself.

"My daughter has a friend, A (13F), who has been going through some health issues that I don’t want to put here. A’s mum passed away when she was little so it’s just her and her dad. Since he has started dating his girlfriend (we’ll call her C) A’s needs have been pushed to the side a little and he’s just not noticed that A has been struggling. She’s doing better now after getting the help she needed.

However, A’s hair has been extremely matted as it had not been brushed for months. A had been hiding her hair under hats and hoods at home and trying to disguise it at school in buns. She stayed over at the weekend and I only found out about her hair when they came downstairs after getting a comb stuck in A’s hair trying to fix it. I comforted A as she was ashamed about her hair but had hoped that she and my daughter could fix it. My daughter convinced her to tell me about it as she had been scared to say anything to anyone as she thought she would be judged as her dad’s girlfriend has made comments about her appearance when she was going through her health issues. When A was going through her issues, I made it clear to her and my daughter that our home is a judgement free zone and if she ever wanted to come to me or my husband for help then she would get it. A then asked for help detangling her hair. So that’s what I did. We put on some films and worked on detangling A’s hair. It took hours, but it was doable.

When A went home on Sunday, her hair was completely detangled and neatly braided into two dutch braids. She was happy and thanked me for helping with her hair. Then Monday I got an angry phone call from C because she was meant to be taking A to get her hair cut due to how matted her hair was. Apparently C and A’s dad had noticed how bad it was and C had told me that she would get it sorted. C is mad because the salon they were going to had charged her a cancellation fee for cancelling the day of the appointment. C wants me to pay her back for the cancellation fee as it’s my fault for fixing A’s hair when they were going to get it cut out. I told her that I wouldn’t be paying it, I just did the right thing by A instead of going to the extreme option straight away. C then said that A was no longer allowed to be friends with my daughter and they would sue me for the cancellation fee. It was £60 (half the cost of the cut).

My daughter told me that A knew about C wanting to cut her hair and A didn’t want the hair cut which is why she went to my daughter for help. A like my own daughters has long hair, so cutting the matted hair out would have meant her losing well over half of the length of her hair.

AITA for brushing out A’s hair so she avoided getting a drastic cut.

Update: This got more attention than I thought it would. I would just like to clarify a couple things. 1. While I am not going to go fully into A's health issues, the matted hair is the result of a depressive episode. Once things got better, she was just very embarrassed by the state her hair was in but didn't know how to fix it. So she hid it and it got worse. She is able to brush and wash her hair when she's ok. 2. A isn't being neglected by her dad. He knows he hasn't been the best dad to A and is trying to be better when it comes to her. Since A's health issues, he has been seeking help. I'm not going to report a man who I can see is trying to get better as a parent.

A's dad (I'll call him J) came round earlier as he wanted to talk to me. A and C had gotten into a shouting match yesterday because of the cancelled appointment. C had told A that she wasn't allowed to see my daughter anymore until I paid the money I owed - this was news to J - and A told C that she was going to continue seeing her friend. A also told C that she hated her and that if anyone was going to take the place of her mum it would be me because I care about A as a person not just her appearance. J wanted to know what had happened with A and why I owed C money. I explained it all to J and he was horrified to learn that C was going to cut A's hair short instead of helping her. He had been under the impression that the appointment had been to get her hair detangled and wouldn't have consented to A getting a big chop. He hadn't realised how focused C had become on A's appearance with her hair. He told me that he wasn't going to stop A coming around as he knows how important my family is to her. When her mum died and he fell apart, we provided the stability they both needed. I told J that A is always welcomed here and she knows it, but it's her dad that she needs. She needs him to be there for her and to support her through whatever she is going through, having her dad will mean more to her than having me there. J agreed with this, and that he knows he's not been the dad that she needs and is going to try and be better for her. He's asked if I could recommend a family therapist who could help them, and I gave him a few names. Since A started going through her issues, J has stepped up. He's not the same dad that he was when they started but he does still have a way to go to be dad of the year. 

Since speaking with J I've had angry texts from C, furious that I 'went behind her back' and spoke with J when she was dealing with the issue. In the string of angry texts she sent me, she said horrible things about myself, A and my daughter. I'm not engaging with her anymore, she's a walking red flag. I screenshotted them before blocking C and sent them to J's work phone (J gave me his work number when he started dating C because she had been screening and deleting messages before he saw them. She doesn't have access to his work phone.)  My daughter has been messaging A making sure she is ok, and she will be coming to stay at the weekend as she doesn't want to be at home when C collects her stuff. I'm not sure what is going on with that relationship, nor do I want to know but it does sound like J is finally putting A first.",0
"An old friend(non-black f) just texted me(black f) with a short snapchat video of them saying a rap lyric with the n-word in it and then a meme. I assume that they wanted to see how I was doing after all this time; if so a short funny video and meme is a perfectly good way to do that. The issue at hand is that I told the friend I liked the meme but I'd prefer that they dont say the n-word to me. I maintain that anyone can say what ever they want because they have the ability to speak but I (I think understandably) would prefer that my non-black friends do not feel comfortable just saying the n-word around me and calling me that when ever. My old friend took offense to me asking her not to say the n-word to me and went into a fairly standard ""you used to say it a lot in highschool and I dont have to care about your feelings because your soft now"" speech. I also believe she is well within her rights to feel this way, but we just dont have to hangout if thats the case. I just told them that I'm not trying to judge and I dont expose private conversations but I just wanted them to not say it to me is all; and if they feel that way about me then it just is what it is. Am I an asshole here? I've never been one to get insulted by or even care what people say, but there are certain rules I have for my own personal life that I feel dont effect anyone more then regular social rules/life.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone that responded, Im happy to see there are multiple opinions on this so I can at least understand that my concern on whether or not I ATA is valid. After reading everyone's comments, I've decided that if we not close like that where I can trust you then Im not trying to hear you saying sensitive words or topics. I still believe that everyone is well within their rights to say what ever they want but I dont want to stick around for the consequences of someone I barley know doing or saying something possibly problematic; if you are my close friend however, I wont just leave you high and dry, you've earned my trust and friendship the same way I've hopefully earned yours.

"I (19F) live with my friend Will (22M). We've known eachother since birth because my dad and his mom are close friends.

Will is Jewish and he hasn't been able to get home for Hanukkah which has made him a depressed. He initially wanted to do nothing to celebrate and just sulk but I bought a menorah and we've been lighting the candles every night. He isn't religious but it's been fun learning about his traditions.

Yesterday, I didn't not have work so I decided to try make some traditional Jewish food for him since he baked me a cake for my birthday a few months ago. I love cooking but I'm a hazard in the kitchen so I had to start early but I managed to make some brisket, latkes and some (misshapen) challah bread. I burned myself atleast six times but I love learning new recipes so it's all good. I also had a blue shirt that looks similar to the blue that a lot of Hanukkah decorations are so I put that on.

When Will got home, he posted the food on his snap story and I appeared in some of the shots. One of our mutual friends, Nadine (21F) then messaged me and 'called me out' for 'cosplaying' Jewish culture. I can only describe her as the woke police and most of us have learnt to ignore her white guilt and saviourism but this pissed me off so I decided to engage. I told her that I was trying to do something nice for a friend (will) who was sad he couldn't celebrate with family and he appreciated my efforts. She told me that the food wasn't a big deal, but me wearing the blue shirt was 'blatant appropriation' and I shouldn't have done it. This was obviously completely ridiculous and I told her to mind her own business and leave me the hell alone.

She's now shared the conversation with other friends and even posted it to her Instagram activism account, staying that her 'business' is to call out people like me who are being harmful. She's demanding that I apologize and acknowledge my 'ignorance' in order for her to take them down. Other friends agree that she is being ridiculous, but that I was wrong to be rude to her because we know how she is and she had good intentions. Another friend, Robert (20M) even said that I was being an asshole for getting rude to her and refusing to apologize. Will doesn't think I'm wrong and this whole situation has me really confused. AITA for telling her to mind her own business?",0
"So it has been a year now since me and this guy became friends and he had become a super cool dude around me. Every day we hung out the beginning of the year on VC until 6am playing games together and he would eventually make me want to buy a VR headset and I had a blast hanging out with him. But unfortunately he never wanted to hangout with me in person only during VC. He would always say no or that he is busy which made me a little upset but I kept that to myself because he worked a lot.

However recently it’s been 4 months since me and my friend hung out due to me being busy with my new boyfriend and hanging out with his friends and my own that by the end of the week I feel emotionally exhausted to hang out with anyone else.  Recently my friend got mad at me about it and now barely talks to me at work hell he would ignore me and leave the room sometimes when I was there and it was frustrating. People like him makes it harder to wanna find new friends due to them overreacting.",0
"I have been living with a roommate for about six months now. She is ten years older than me and has two small terrier dogs. We get along great. Only one of her dogs is sweet and will let me pet him and play with him, the other… not so much. 

Everytime I get home from work or leave the house I am barked at by the dog who “doesn’t like me” and my roommate’s solution to it is to spray him with water and talk to him in a baby voice saying “don’t do that.” 

Last night I got home from a horrible shift at work (I am a NICU nurse, so you can imagine what I mean when I say horrible) and my roommate’s dogs were in the living room with her instead of upstairs behind the gate like they usually are. The dog barked at me and jumped all over me, scratching me, and then bit me twice. He drew blood and took my skin off. My roommate did not even discipline him or apologize to me, and instead told me that “the fact you didn’t play with him when you first moved in and got to know him is why he barks at you and did that (biting) to you.” 

I got angry and told her I was sick of it, she didn’t train them right and I would be moving out in a week. I told her I do play with them, and when she isn’t home her one dog doesn’t bark at me. It’s only when she’s home that he does, assuming that he is trying to protect her.

"So I (23F) have a LOT of siblings. My dad got married five times and has divorced 4 times, has 12 children in total, probably more that he does not even know about. I know it sounds so hard to believe but we come from a culture where you are asked to have a lot of kids and are even praised for it. I don't maintain contact with most of them, only my half sister and brother. Recently, as in 2 months ago, I got a call from my oldest half sister (41F), let's call her Nadine. Nadine said she was stranded in the city I live in after a tinder date gone wrong, she had met someone online and traveled here to meet them and got catfished. She got robbed and needed some place to stay, so I gladly took her in. In my life, I've only met Nadine a bunch of times, the age gap is too big for us to actually have anything to bond over. She asked if she could stay with me for a while as my roommate, and I told her she can if she pays rent and does some chores, and she agreed. 

In the time she has been living with me, she has been making comments about how I earn my money. I earn a good amount, I managed to buy a shabby house with it, it may be messy, but a home is a home. I earn through an online adult site and some other ventures, and Nadine found it despicable. A week in, she began trying to talk me out of it. She said I was making a mistake, going against god, yadda yadda. I said I didn't need her input on it and that if she has a problem with it she can leave. She kept pressing me about it and I've been ignoring it until today when she asked me to come speak to her. She said that as my older sister, she was going to make sure I stop doing the sInFuL things and choose a more proper path, and that she will inform my parents about how I am earning money (they think I have a desk job). I told her she is full of it, that it is my business. She has no right over me. Well she called up my parents and told them and I am PISSED. My parents have threatened to disown me and I honestly can't understand what she expected to gain from it. 

&#x200B;

So I told her she has 2 days to pack up and leave, and she said I was becoming a pathetic loser and some other stuff. I found that hilarious, since she was 41 with no spouse, no home of her own, she couch surfs her way through life and hasn't held a good job for more than 6 months. She literally got catfished and robbed and had to move into my home as she had nowhere to go. I called her a failure at life, that she has nothing to her name, no one who is even willing to take her in anymore because she has lived over 40 years without a plan or goal. That she should take care of herself and make something of herself before she can lecture me about her archaic opinions. She cried about it and I ignored her and made myself dinner.

Well she said she will move out, and my parents are still pissed at me but can't really do anything to me. I feel bad about what I said, but I also feel its justified. Idk man, AITA?",0
"My husband was laid off. I'm super concerned because we have two young children (one of whom is special needs), and I'm worried sick about the house payment, food, bills, medicine, etc. I have a job, but it's not enough to really keep us afloat long-term by itself. 

&#x200B;

A job came up that my husband would be perfect for. He has all of the experience needed and he would be making excellent money--even more than he was making before. It would solve everything. However, the job involves working for a local politician that my husband doesn't align with politically. I'm really annoyed that my husband is automatically dismissing this job. We \*need\* this. We can't afford for him to be choosy right now. We have to do what we can do put food on the table for our kids, at least until he can find something else. Plus, maybe he can influence some of the things he disagrees with. Maybe he can be the change he wants to see?

However, he's refusing to even consider it while I'm scrimping and skipping meals to save costs. AITA for being frustrated and angry that he's refusing to even consider this job?",0
"For context, I (25F) am my sister's (29F) maid of honor. I recently graduated from college and am just starting in another city and joining the workforce. As expected my finances are tight.

The problem is that my sister doesn't have an exact date for the wedding but wants a huge, expensive wedding. That's her call, but with a big expensive wedding comes a big, expensive bachelorette party, dresses, makeup, etc. We have less than 6 months til her supposed wedding date weekend she wants.

I am currently saving up to buy a car so my finances are not that flexible. I am fine delaying my car for my sister's wedding but I still have a budget. If this were a friend I probably would have politely declined stating that I couldn't afford it, but this is my sister.

Now she is angry at me for asking her for a general idea of how much I should be expected to spend. (For context she has not even asked her friends to be in her bachelorette party yet so I have no one to talk to compare how much they have set aside. I just know I am the maid of honor since that was one of my parent's stipulations for them to contribute to her wedding.) Our father is staying out of this and my mother said that they will help cover any expenses I can't, but I know that would mean dipping into their savings to do so.



(P.S.- I feel like this needs to be said but I don't know where to put it. But she is looking to spend $150,000-$200,000 on her wedding at least. For me I would have to pay for my dresses, she wants me to wear three different ones, makeup, and hair twice (she is having two receptions for some reason). This does not include me buying my plane tickets, hotel, and wedding gift. Not to mention I have to take a week off of work, which is over half of my PTO for the year.) (Our parents aren't rich, my sister is just taking out loans and using her savings on the wedding.)",0
"I paid a trip for two of my friends to rome, i paid their hotel and their flights so only thing they had to do was buy their own food etc. Im not rich- im just a student still.  but the other one is a very close friend of mine and she just turned 18 so i wanted her to have a special birthday. So I decided to buy her a trip to rome with another close friend of ours.


Well their flight company messed up and they had to go through amsterdam in order to get home, the flight left 4 hours early and they were home maybe two hours later instead of the original time.

The company compestated to both of them 200€ so about 400€ in total. They obviously want this money for themselfs but shouldnt I the be one keeping this money for myself? I dont know honestly lol please help me out

EDIT: This subreddit is awesome! thank yall so so so much for helping me with this. We made a split- both of them get 100€ and i get the rest 200€!!<3",0
"Today I emailed my supervisor about the process of putting in my two weeks notice. I'm an RA on campus, and I've been here for about a month. During training (the first three weeks of August), we were working 8am-2am doing normal training during the day and other residual duties during the night like door decs, bulletin boards, room check reports, loft kits, bunk kits, welcome decor, etc. I was exhausted and ready to quit by the end of it, but I saw the start of school as the light at the end of the tunnel. It was not.

I'm a first year RA in a freshman dorm, I was given the hall with almost all athletes (including the entire freshman class of rugby players), and given 48 residents when I was told to expect about 25 when I was hired. Enrollment is down across campus, so they closed half of the dorm halls and filled the other half to maximum capacity and hired less RAs to save money. Since the start of school, I've had to write up about 15 residents for things like quiet hour violations, parties, alcohol, and weed. As a result, the residents hate me and have started to write nasty comments about me on a whiteboard near my room.

Mine and other RAs concerns have not been met with any action from the reslife staff. Before school started we told the staff that we were concerned that alcohol and drug incidents would be worse this year due to lifting covid restrictions, our concerns fell on deaf ears and the RAs are paying for it. I have worked upwards of 60 hours this week on a stipend that only pays me about $200 a pay period.

I texted my friend tonight to express my frustration and let her know that I was quitting. I was met with her accusing me of being cowardly and running away from the challenge instead of stepping up to the plate. She told me that real life and jobs aren't easy, and that things won't get handed to me like I'm used to. I believe she was referencing my scholarship being handed to me, I have an academic full ride (tuition, room & board, meal plan) at the school I attend, and I've worked towards it my whole life. It was not handed to me. She said I should just be happy to have a job, and shouldn't walk away when it gets hard. She's mad at me now, saying I'm acting privileged by quitting my job and she thinks I should stay so I don't let my fellow RAs down. She says the workload I'll be putting on them is unfair and that I should just suck it up for my coworkers sake.

Am I the asshole for quitting?",0
"At a crossroads here, I feel like it's a petty issue.

Backstory; myself/my friend have been best mates awhile, now both 27. We live in separate cities, but always catch up when we can.

He's always struggled with mental issues I believe. The sort of, night is going great and pulls the old Irish goodbye. Wouldn't be a problem, but he'll post something negative on his insta/snap story afterwards. I've tried helping him before (philosophy/stoicism helped me through a lot), but he doesn't seem open to any kind of personal reflection/feedback, even from me. 

Recently, we went to a concert, having a great time, when I've suggested we get out of the mosh, have water, head home. The set was nearly finished anyway, nine hour drive for me the next day, late, so I had to get gone. While we're walking out, I noticed his mood was a little off (this happens in an instant occasionally), but I care about the guy so thought, while I'm filling up my bottle I'll fill up his too. It was in his pocket, he was on his phone, so I told him, ""I'm going to fill up your bottle.""

Im in a good mood, thought maybe some of my mood might rub off onto him. Anyway, I go to hand his bottle back, and he starts directing a lot of anger to me. ""I didn't ask you to do that.""  ""Why would you just take my bottle?""  And then just flat out refuses to have the water bottle back. So I go, ""Okay dude. Anything else going on?"" but he is just fixated on my filling his water bottle for him. I shrug, suggest we leave, and we walked back to the motel in different directions; I took the shorter route, know how important cooling off is, and he was acting very coldly to me so I went on my way. The cold behaviour continued after the 40 minute walk, even when I politely asked him to make less noise/turn off the light as I was trying to sleep.

It isn't the first time stuff like this has happened, but I feel a responsibility as someone who is kinda in control of their shit that I need to be the bigger person and let it roll off my back. I love him, we're best friends, and I'm sure something else was going on/know he has mental health issues, but he always (and has continued to do so afterwards) acts like it never happened, and gets super defensive/obtuse if I bring it up. It would be unusual for him to arrive at a point where I'd get an apology from him without asking.

AITA for thinking I've grown beyond a really good mate, and wanting an apology for his behaviour at the concert?

TL;DR - my best mate acted really coldly toward me for filling his water bottle after a rock concert (certain other things were going on), and I don't know if it's mature of me or not to ask for an apology.

Had to edit for verbosity, so please excuse any grammar. Can clarify below if needed.",0
"Recently moved into a new flat with a person I found on Sparerooom. Before we moved in we talked about how we both were in a hybrid work from home environment, and how that would be fine a few days a week. We also talked about how clean we like to keep the flat, and basically just clean up after yourself.

Fast forward a couple of months, and she's worked from the office maybe 3 days and has made our living room her personal office. Not only that but she is working long hours and is sometimes working until 7pm-8pm. I've been very considerate and didn't say anything and have tip toed around her working or waited to use the kitchen until she was off a conference call. 

However, she's started sending me rude and sarcastic messages about the cleanliness of the flat. To be clear the flat is immaculate, I've had guests over and told them I'll have to clean after they leave(to avoid the messages) and they are flabbergasted because it's already clean. She also sprung on me that she expects the flat to be fully deep cleaned once a week and we should take turns doing that. This was never discussed and I think is quite extreme. However, I still just tried to be a nice roommate and started cleaning and mopping every other week, while I still continue to get snarky messages.

So now the drama, I wanted to have a date over for dinner one night and asked my roommate if there was a night she knew she wouldn't be working late so I could have someone over. She seemed really put off by the request and said she doesn't really know her schedule and she'll have to look. Finally she got back to me that she was going to a show Friday, so I said fine that works. Date comes over I cook a fancy meal, and we clean for 20 minutes afterwards(really setting the mood), then sat on the couch had a couple bottles of wine and moved to my room. Left out were two empty bottles of wine, two glasses on the coffee table, and some missed stains on the counter(beet juice). My roommate gets home at 3am and stomps around the flat(presumably because she's mad about the ""mess"") I got up early in the morning(7:30am on a Saturday for gods sake) and threw the bottles away, and put the glasses in the sink, but missed the tiny beet stains on the counter. 

The next day I got a message about how she's tired of waking up surrounded by stains and bottles. So I sent her a message that said if you can't stand two empty bottles being on the counter for less than 12 hours, and can't stop sending me rude messages than I've been entirely too nice about you setting up a desk in our living room and using it as an office for 60 hours a week and you need to move it into your room. She came back that it's a shared space and that's unfair and she has a right to it as much as I do. I don't know am I the asshole here?

"My wife and I are out of town, I didn't want to post this on my regular account since I've spoken on the sub about what there is to do here and I want to protect everyone's privacy. The timeline here is also not exact just for privacy reasons. 

My wife is 26, we've been married for 5 years and have a great and fun marriage. Her ""free pass"" has always been John Krasinski  which I always thought was kind of a fun little joke between but after the way she's been acting since yesterday I'm starting to think she might be serious. 

So here's how it went down. We were out and I ran into JK (just because I don't want to type Krasinksi out again) outside a men's room. It was one of those ""wow"" moments because it was really him. I sort of gave him a nod and turned around to make sure it was him and another woman came up to him and asked for a picture and he told her bluntly but politely that he was there with his wife and had promised her he was like 100% hers that day. The girl was like ""oh my god that's so sweet, nice to meet you anyways."" So when I got back to where we were sitting I told my wife ""you aren't going to believe this but JK is here."" She was totally hung over but she like instantly had a shot of coke and perked up. She spotted where he was and was like ""oh my god it's really him, of course he's with the hottest woman ever."" I was like ""yeah babe, they've been married for like 20 years."" She replied with ""I know, stupid."" I was like wow...  She grabbed her phone and tried to run over and grab a pic with him. 

I was like no, no, no I just heard him say that he didn't want to take any pictures. She said she didn't care. I grabbed the back of her dress and sort of guided her back to sitting down. I told her what he had just said by the bathroom. She didn't want to believe me and then accused me of asking for the picture and ""ruining it for her."" I told her that actually no a more rational and sane woman had asked for the picture and JK had politely shut her down. My wife snapped at me and told me  ""that bitch obviously wasn't a big a fan I am."" I begged her to at least calm down and we'll wait until JK and his wife are outside and we'll try to politely catch them on the street. My wife got all pouty and put her sunglasses on as I guess her hangover had caught back up to her. Our server came over and asked for our order and in that time JK and his wife had left. Wife went sprinting out of the restaurant with her phone but came back sulking so I guess she didn't find him. 

My wife is pissed, like sulking like a 4 year old and while I thought maybe it was like a ""fun"" thing...it's not. She's legitimately mad. I'm sure she'll eventually get past it but right now is the most awkward time I've ever spent with her. 

Was I the asshole? Should I just allowed her to go over and make a fool over herself even though I had the information that he didn't want to take any pictures? I feel like I did the right thing but she's making me feel terrible.",0
"I have been on the PTA board at my kids school for a while now, going into my fourth year. We have an event every month in the evening’s, where we have always sold coke Diet Coke Sprite and bottled water.
We have a lot of Americans, and a fair amount of diabetic people in the school, and the Diet Coke has always sold very well.

At one of the school events last spring, I was put in charge of the concession table, and very surprised to learn that at a board meeting I had missed, two brand new members had railroaded and pushed for a diet soda ban, citing religious and cultural concerns.

NTA: specifically, they are from countries where food has less chemicals, and diet soda is just not readily available (I lived in one for a long time), and they cited something about the Bible that frankly didn’t really make sense to me.

I asked what diabetic people were supposed to drink, and one of the ladies smirked, “if they want to be diabetic, they can just drink water.“

Although I am thin, I have been a t2 diabetic most of my life. (Thanks DNA, you’re the best!) The dozen odd people at the school who know about my condition, are diabetic or parents of diabetics themselves.

I was absolutely mortified to explain to parents and students, the diet soda had been banned. This is not a school rule, this is just something a couple PTA ladies made up. 

The board looked tone deaf, ableist, and not business savvy, but I look like a dumbass traitor.

We have another planning meeting tonight, and I need to bring this up again. I’m probably going to say that because I’m diabetic, I will not be working the concession table as long as they have this unfair and unkind role. Or, I might say that I’ll just bring cans of Diet Coke and sell them myself.

WIBTA if I did either? What’s a way to not be the asshole here? This is not my first time complaining about ableism at that school.

ETA: these people aren’t Mormon. Please, cut the Mormon-bashing. Those ladies are way to smart to be on the PTA.",0
"A former coworker had been trying to set me up with a friend of hers for a while. We agreed to go on a double date on Friday; my coworker, her fiancé, her friend and I. The whole week she's been telling me that her friend was super excited to meet me.

A few minutes before I arrived to the restaurant we were meeting at, my coworker called me and apologized; they had a family emergency and would not be there, but she assured me her friend would still go and was excited to meet me.

When I met her a few minutes later, however, she absolutely didn't look excited to meet me. In fact, she was showing no emotion whatsoever. I tried to engage in conversation with her the whole dinner but as I later told my best friend ""I've had much more engaging conversations with your cat. At least he meows back at me when I say something"". After dinner, we politely said goodbye and went on separate ways. I didn't even asked for her number.

Yesterday I was talking with my coworker, who asked me about the date. She said ""Why didn't you asked for [girls] number? She said you had a great time yesterday!"" I laughed at this and told her the girl was out of her mind if she thought that was a good time. 

Apparently, the girl was with my coworker at that moment and heard everything. My coworker says I should apologize, because she's a very shy girl and that's why she couldn't talk, but I should apologize and give her a second chance.",0
"I have a son, as the title states, and he's very into looking a certain way. I've been informed it's called an aesthetic, and I'm fine with him dressing however he wants. But my son also suffers from a medical condition (plantar fasciitis) which leaves him with incredibly sore feet after just standings for three minutes. Twenty minutes standing and he's close to tears. 

Now, I am fully aware that the big boots he wears makes it worse. I've let it slide, but before quarantine he just about collapsed while we were out shopping. I've been dreading the talk, because he acts like these boots are his god, and have been the only thing he will wear for three years. 

Anyway, I finally told him that I was going to buy him some trainers. He got a little upset, and I very quickly told him I wasn't getting rid of his boots. He didn't really want to talk to me much for the rest of the day. 

I then informed him that one, possibly two times a week, we would start taking family walks (him wearing trainers) and he wasn't happy about it, but he had that air about him that said ""I won't do it"" and I very quickly made sure he would, it was for his health. 

He started crying, very very quickly. Now, last I saw him cry like this was when we had to inform him that he was no longer allowed to see his dog (it was a shared dog, didn't live with us, story for another time). 

After about two hours of trying to get him to talk, he told me it was because trainers wouldn't match his clothes so he'd have to wear a whole different outfit, which isn't his aesthetic, and he thought that he'd look ugly. Id always known he'd had self image issues, but not this bad. He eventually calmed down and we bought him some nice grey trainers. 

Now, I confided in multiple friends and my older sister, as they all had older children. My sister was a mistake and basically just insulted my son's masculinity (he can be quite feminine, something we encourage). 

But now, one friend told me I was a bad parent for putting that on him, and forcing him to change. I'm genuinely second guessing myself, and if I made a mistake. 

So, was I in the wrong?


INFO: He has insoles, therapy does not work for him, he has trainers now and is allowed to customise them.

Also, I'm a mother of three. One of my children is two years old. Replies will be short, and I may stop replying for a small while, so if you have a question perhaps check the other comments?

UPDATE: I have no idea how many people will see this, but basically the trainers arrived and he didn't like them. I've sent them back and after I get my money back I'll buy him some different ones. 

Now I am working on a second opinion, but I did call his doctor for clarification because a few people were saying changing his shoes probably wouldn't do much. 

He basically told me it was because his boots aren't lace up. Due to them being slip on, they slide about and my son clenches his foot unintentionally to hold it in place which was making the condition a lot worse. Also the sole of his shoe is very hard so the doctor is recommending we buy him a memory foam soled shoe. 

So I was incorrect, he does not need trainers. I'm hoping to find something he'll like in a more boot style, but as someone else pointed out his boots seem like a comfort item, which is why he's so upset. I'm hoping to trade them out for something else, but I'm not too sure it will go down well.",0
"I apologize beforehand, English is not my first language and is my first time posting.

Backstory: I (22M) and my girlfriend (24F) have been together for 6 years. We both like videogames but I play more than her for the following reasons:

1. She gets nauseous while playing games that have a lot of camera movement.

2. She doesn't have a lot of time, she works about 60 hours a week.

3. She doesn't purchase games, she has to help her family with bills.

We've been wanting to play together for a long time so I tried helping her, I gave her my xbox a few years ago and last year I bought her a laptop and shared my steam account with her. But again, she hasn't been able to play because of the reasons mentioned earlier.

Story:

I bought a game called Stardew Valley for myself a couple years ago but didn't make time to play it until I realized it had multiplayer in it, so I thought it was the perfect game for us, and it is.

I told her about it and she didn't think it was good because it didn't look as pretty as Animal Crossing, but as soon as we started playing we fell in love with it. We play maybe once or twice every week for about 1 or 2 hours.

I really like the game and wanted to play longer, so a couple weeks ago I told her that I was going to create a new save file so I could play by myself and she said ""sure, no problem. I'll do the same when I have time."" So I did just that, I played on my savefile when I was alone and played with her on our shared savefile whe she was available.

The issue began this week, she came to my house as I was playing and she saw that I was advancing really fast and I had a lot of things already. She got angry and I told her that it had nothing to do with our farm and that I still enjoyed playing with her and I thought that was it.

Yesterday she was in my room and I went to the kitchen to make dinner, but when I came back to the room I saw that she literally destroyed my farm. My crops were gone, my animals were gone, my buildings were destroyed and I had no money, so a lot of hours getting those things wasted. She had already saved so I couldn't fix it.

Of course it is not the end of the world but I was really pissed so I yelled at her. She screamed back saying that I was supposed to play with her and that I left her behind, I told her that it was not a competition and that I was just enjoying the game, I wanted to play with her and play separately on my own farm, that is why I created two farms.

I just gave her her dinner and told her to not speak to me and we went to sleep like that. Today she apologized and told me that she wants to play, but I told her that I don't want to play with her anymore, heck I don't even want to play Stardew Valley anymore.

AITA for getting mad and refusing to play with her anymore? I can understand her frustration because she doesn't have a lot of free time but on the other hand, she destroyed something of mine just to hurt me.",0
"I (37F) am a work at home mom. We have an autistic 5yr old who I homeschool and a one year old. They both have therapies I have to take them to several days a week. My husband (35M) works outside the home full time. I don’t mind doing his laundry, all I ask is that he put the dirty laundry I need to clean in the bathroom where the rest of the dirty laundry is so that I know to include those items. Lately, he just shucks off his house clothes for his work clothes in the morning and then leaves them on the floor. 

We have a small 11yo dog. We’ve been together 7 years and I’ve had the dog since before we met. He KNOWS that if he leaves his clothes on the floor, the dog will pee on them. She always has. Only his clothes too. She’s spayed, shes house trained, we don’t know why and we’ve never been able to stop it. So of course,  the clothes he’s been leaving on the floor have been peed on. 

Before he brought up that the dog was peeing on his clothes and the smell was getting to him, I didn’t know he was leaving his clothes there at all. His side is his side. I don’t go through his things and I’m pretty occupied by baby care all day. I don’t even see him getting ready for work as I’m getting up when he’s leaving. But somehow he’s saying it’s my fault that the carpet and his clothes now need deep cleaning because I didn’t pick them up and I knew the dog would pee on them.

Update: thanks for the responses! Just to let everyone know, I did have a Frank discussion with him and he cleaned all the clothes, shampooed the carpet himself, and bought a new area rug for that space bc the carpet is black and he wants to be able to see if the dog goes there again even though he used the pet stain cleaner. 

He also did extra laundry. Still not 100% sure what caused the out of character behavior but the lines of communication are more open. The responses here gave me more confidence to bring it all up and I’m glad I did.",0
"A little backstory before the issue: I 36F and my niece 16F are extremely close my younger sister had her when she was 18 and I helped raise her while my sister went to university the dad isn't in the picture. My sister married her current husband J a year ago, ill admit I'm not the guy's biggest fan he's extremely conservative and our opinions tend to clash a bit but my sister is happy so I don't typically say anything. My niece is not his biggest fan and has been spending a lot more time with me.

My niece loves to read, something she definitely got from me. She spends every weekend and most of the summer with me she has her own room at my place. When her mom first got married she was complaining to me that J has started becoming overbearing and inputting rules that were never in place before. Like a much earlier curfew, policing how she dresses, going to church every Sunday, and after going through my niece's book collection telling her that she's not allowed to read certain things. That includes anything having to do with the LGBTQ community, sex, or mythology. She got around the church Sunday rule because she stays with me and I suggested that she send any books that would be considered banned to my house so she can read them while she stays with me. Well it was her birthday a few weeks a ago and J got her a gift card for books she used the gift card to buy the Heart Stopper series which she sent to my house since the book is about a teenage gay romance. She was asked if she had used the gift card and said yes and my sister and J got suspisous that no books had come in the mail yet. They presurred her into telling them about where the books were since it was technically their money and she admitted that she sends books that she cant read at home to me. J kicked her out of the house for this and shes currently staying with me now. My sister wants her to come back home now that things have cooled off with J. I left the decision up to my niece and she wants to live with me now and my sister is pretty upset. J and my sister think I was an asshole to go over their heads and let her send her books here. Most of my family is on my sisters side except for my dad. 

AITA for letting my sister send ""banned"" books to my house?",0
"My daughter is 23 and she requested dinner with us because she had some important to tell us--being my wife and I. 

She introduced us and came out. My wife was emotional gave her a big hug, and told her how proud she was. I on the other hand did not react to her coming out. I honestly did not care about that part. I was honest her partner was cool, and she was very interesting. 

My wife told me I was rude for ignoring our daughter's announcement. I told my wife, that I did not care who she was attracted to all I cared about was if she was happy. I tried to explain I did not care about that stuff, people like who they like I don't need labels for that. Love is love. 

She said my view is slightly homophobic because it shows I am not acknowledging a different view. I do not see it that way, am I the asshole should I apologize to my daughter and her partner?

Edit: For added context, I did not treat her situation as any different from her brothers. I took the time to get to know the person they were with. 

My wife feels I should have treated it differently because they are different situations, ignoring that fact does not help.

Update: Thanks for the input, everyone is right I should have just asked my daughter. I will see if she is free tomorrow for some coffee and have a chat with her. I am sure my wife's words just got to me, but only one way to find out right? 

Thanks again.

Update: Since it always bothered me when people would ghost on threads without giving updates. 

Did not have much time with my daughter she had a prior engagement but we had some coffee. We spoke about the evening, as I suspected she did not have an issue with it, and she also felt it was self-explanatory when she introduced her girlfriend--she corrected me since I said partner they view each other as girlfriend and girlfriend. 

The coming out was more so her girlfriend's idea and my daughter said she was going to reach out because while she had no issues with my reactions her girlfriend thought it was weird how I kind of brushed off the response and treated this situation as if they were a straight couple. 

My daughter did try to explain that is just the person I am. Explained how she preferred my nonreaction verse making it a big deal. She told the story of how she came to me first when she had her first period because she knew my wife would make a huge fuss over simple biology. 

I told her I made an AITA post and we laughed over some of the comments. We are going to arrange another date and this time we will have a more special event for the sake of her girlfriend. Since she did feel slightly offended by being treated as if they were a straight couple. 

My daughter had no issues overall, but I will correct course. She was slightly disappointed I did not make a dad joke about her coming out. I did express that my love for her would never change, and I told her I hoped she did not wait so long because she thought I would think differently. She just told me I never told you because it was not important to her. She knew I would not care either way. 

I doubt I will add more updates after this I might check in every so often. I do appreciate all the varied viewpoints, and please understand it was not my intention to marginalize the hardships LGBTQA+ face in this world, I know it may be a selfish and self-centered view but I simply treat others how I wish and want to be treated. 

I do hope everyone has a wonderful week.",0
"Throwaway because my close friends know my main account. And just to make it clear - all the events didn't happen in the U.S.

Well... I (24M) am the oldest child in a family of 4 - me, my mother and (step)father and my sister J (17F). I am a product of affair, and I knew it since I was 6 or 7 years old. I had a normal childhood - at least I had a bed to sleep on and food to eat, and I was not beaten by a drunken father.

When I was 7, my mother and her husband had a baby girl - J. She became a favourite one in the family - my mother loved her because she was a girl, her husband - because she was of his own blood. Yes, all that ideologies are still strong in my country.

Our family wasn't poor, and J. got all the best - toys, parties, education... I went to a local public school, J. - to the private institution. She had birthdays in the equestrian club, I never had a birthday party in my life. Same with the tech - my only devices were a laptop and a phone - gifts from my grandma on my 12th birthday, J. had her own room with gaming console and wall-mounted T.V. Same goes for vacations, free time and many more...

At 15 I left home and started living with my grandma. She (and my part-time work) managed to help me with my hobby i had since I was 9 (aviation and engineering), I graduated and got a scholarship in a not very bad university.  Now I am an aircraft engineer (my childhood dream) and slowly starting my own life.

My parents were never heard since I left them until yesterday. My mother called me and asked for us to meet and talk together. I asked - why? She said she wanted to restore our relationship, her - as a parent, mine - as a child. My answer was - I never had a good childhood with her as a parent, and if she wants to become a good parent for me, she can start with giving me things I was deprived in my childhood - like a T.V. or gaming console or even money covering my basic needs like transportation (I still don't have a car because I can't afford it). She called me greedy asshole and hung the phone. I just... Don't know who of us is right... AITA?

EDIT: To make it clear - aircraft engineers, especially with a little experience aren't getting paid very well in my country. I am still struggling to pay my own bills and I have literally zero free money, especially after the COVID.",0

My English class had a project to write an essay with the point of persuading people to agree with an unpopular opinion.

My family is Christian, most of my community is, I was raised that way but am no longer faithful. But they still are, and say gossiping is sinful.

I thought it would be interesting to write an essay saying that gossip is good.

I came up with a bunch of arguments that I'll give you for context. 

1. Gossip acts as a warning and helps people protect themselves. For example I wouldn't date anyone who I heard was cruel to their exes.

2. Gossip can reveal other people's values and help determine social compatibility. For example if I met a person who gossiped nastily about LGBT people I would know to keep away. 

3. Gossip can be a bonding experience between friends, it is cathartic to vent about emotional events rather than stew in silence. 

4. ""Gossip"" is a gendered term, men's talk is rarely called gossip. Perhaps the reason that talk is seen as negative for women but neutral for men, is that women's voices are often undervalued and demeaned. Also, some people fear the impact of women sharing their experiences and thoughts freely. 

5. When conversations are called ""gossipy"", it can often be out of suppression rather than kindness. For example, when the church discourages negative talk about religious leaders, that is dangerous. 

6. Yes, some talk is hurtful. But it should be called bigoted, racist, or something specific. Not simply called gossip, because calling it gossip minimizes it. 

I turned it in a little nervous about how my English teacher would react because I felt like I picked a really unpopular opinion. She's always telling students not to gossip, so I was worried she might also take it personally. 

Today, my teacher told me that she and the guidance counselor wanted to discuss my essay in a meeting after school this week. I asked why and she said we'd talk in the meeting. I asked about my grade and she said she hadn't assigned a grade yet. 

My parents were also called, and when they found out i wrote an essay called ""In Defense of Gossip"" they were mad. I wanted to read them the essay but honestly they were so mad I didn't think they'd listen to 15 pages.

They said they didn't raise me this way and that I was encouraging bullying, and saying that I was being provocative on purpose.

I feel that's kinda unfair, my teacher told us to defend an unpopular or controversial opinion and now people are mad I followed the assignment earnestly? 

I guess I can see where my teacher is coming from a little, because it might feel like a personal attack since she hates gossip. And my parents too, it might feel like I never listened to the stuff they taught me about kindness. 

But I feel also like I was honest.

AITA for writing that essay? I had a feeling it would be controversial.",0
"I have this friend and she’s very straightforward. She also struggled with making friends which took a toll on her mental health. She’s nice and sweet but the problem is, she has no filter. I appreciate her honesty but sometimes, she pokes fun at my insecurities despite me coming clean to her a couple of times on why we should lay off topics about dress sizes and body weight because it triggers my body image issues.

So we went to the mall and she wanted to help me shop. I told her that I wear a size medium or large then her first reaction was “Oh my god! You’re a large? I’m extra small. I can’t believe you’re large.” I tried to laugh it off and told her, “Yeah. I’m not petite.” I didn’t think much of it until she started handing me clothes that are sizes small and extra small which I obviously can’t fit into. She also started repeating over and over on how she couldn’t buy this shirt because they only have it in small and it was too loose on her. She then went on about how she could fit into child size clothes. She basically spent the entire afternoon talking about how she was extra small and I was large. I hit my boiling point when she commented that I don’t look Japanese to her because my face is round and big with no v-line. 

She eventually asked my opinion about why a lot of people don’t like her. Since I was so pissed off anyway, I just told her straight, “It’s because you act like a pick me girl and you are overly competitive over pointless things.” She stared at me in disbelief and started crying. I usually apologize but this time, I didn’t. 

Should I call in and apologize?

EDIT: Thank you for all the helpful suggestions and the insights. I might take a break from her then just talk to her honestly when I’m ready. I would just lay everything on her one last time and if she still makes herself the victim, I’ll just get rid of her immediately.",0
"I (24F) have an older sister, Claire (26F) who is getting married next year. Claire asked me to be one of her seven bridesmaids. I felt honored at first, but the more I think about it, the more I don't want to do it.  
  
Claire has always been really demanding and high maintenance. And now she is even more extreme when it comes to her wedding.

I know being part of her wedding party will mean a lot of stress and drama. She critiques every detail about our dresses, hair, makeup, etc. and makes unreasonable demands.  
  
When I tried to gently tell Claire I don't feel comfortable being a bridesmaid, she completely lost it on me. She called me selfish and accused me of trying to ruin the most important day of her life. Now the whole family is pressuring me to give in and be part of her wedding party.  
  
I offered to attend the wedding as a regular guest, but Claire said if I'm not a bridesmaid then I shouldn't bother coming at all. Am I being unreasonable here?

I don't want to cause family drama, but I really think being a bridesmaid will be miserable with how Claire is acting. AITA?",0
"AITA 
About a week ago my(18f) parents told me that we were going to Weymouth(Uk) for my cousins(5m) birthday party. The plan was on Friday night we were going to go down, stay at a hotel for the night and surprise my cousins for the party the next morning,then come home on Sunday morning. I then got a text from my best friend (17f) telling me that her birthday party would be on the Saturday. 

I went and spoke to my parents ,whom my best friend is quite close with, we sent her a video explaining how we would be away on the Saturday. She responded about 10 minutes later saying “oh dw” (which means, don’t worry) I then texted her and said I’m free the previous and following weekends and she responded “I told you I’m busy”. I responded saying “oh ok well let me know when you’re free” she didn’t reply.

-The next day-

I saw her while I was walking my dog, she had just been at the gym and had no makeup on. I asked her if she wanted to come over to mine to discuss when she was free. She seemed happy and said “Yeah let me get home and get ready, I had a shower at the gym so I’ll only be about 20 minutes.” I replied “ok I’ll see you soon.” 30 mins goes by at this point I had gotten home and she lives 2 mins away from me so she must have been home. I texted her “hey did you get home”she says “yes I’ll be 2 mins” 

2hours and 30 minutes later after I cried about her being so late my parents told me to just forget it and go out with them I said ok
 She then texted saying “hey I’m just having dinner I’ll be over in a sec.” I was shocked  she thinks after 2 and a half hours she can just show up  I told her how I was going out with my parents. The response she sent made my angry and upset, she said “ Are you cancelling on me!” No babes you cancelled on me(Obviously I didn’t say that) I said “No just rescheduling” again she left me on read. 

She ghosted me for a week!


The day of her party I with my cousins when I got an angry text from her boyfriend (*Swearing)

Boyfriend: YOU BITCH DO YOU REALLY THINK YOUR STUPID FUCKING COUSIN IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HER SHE HAS BEEN WAITING FOR YOU ALL NIGHT YOU RUINED HER BIRTHDAY SHE IS SCREAMING AND CRYING 

I did not respond
This message hurt me not because I was being called a bitch but because he called my 5 YEAR OLD COUSIN fucking stupid.
  (Also forgot to mention her actual birthday was not for 3 more days yet)

An hour after the angry boyfriend text I got one from her. 

Bestfriend: You’re such a selfish asshole it was my 18th birthday party and you missed it 
I’m sorry I’m such a burden.
        
      Guilt tripping ⬆️

I ghosted and got more angry texts from her and mutuals
On her actual birthday I didn’t get her a gift nor did I  even message her
I got MORE angry text referencing to me as the asshole.

My parents keep telling me it’s not my fault I’m not the asshole but I just need some reassurance.

So please AITA????????",0
"I'm getting married next year. One of my older sisters owns a dress boutique and offered to discount my dress for me as a gift. I thought that was so nice of her and picked out my dream dress. (It's similar to [this one](https://www.davidsbridal.com/Product_chiffon-halter-plunge-beaded-waist-wedding-dress-wg4014_a-line-wedding-dresses) for context). The order is in and I thought that was that. 

For background: I'm the youngest in a huge family. I have 4 sisters and two brothers. Dozens of cousins a few years older than me. You get the idea. I've always loved hanging out with kids and did my schooling in early childhood development and just started working as a pre-k teacher. So, as my generation in the family started having kids, I became their go-to babysitter. And I loved it. I love those kids so much. When I met my fiancee, I started getting close with her nieces too. Needless to say, we're having a big, kid-friendly wedding. 

Here's the problem. I had an idea that my fiancee and I love. After the ceremony, we want to do an activity with the kids where guests (whoever wants to, mainly kids I think will be into it) dip one of their hands in non-toxic ink and put a print on the skirt of my dress. They get to have some artsy fun and I get to have a beautiful reminder of all the people I love being with me on the happiest day of my life. 

I mentioned it to my family while we were visiting, and while some were starting to say it was a nice idea, my sister went nuts. She started yelling that she didn't go to all that trouble to get me a beautiful dress just for me to ruin it after basically an hour wearing it. She spilled her coffee all over the floor and stormed out. Now my family are asking me to re-think and say she has a point about ruining the dress. I don't know much about wedding etiquette or anything, but I figured it was my dress and I could do what I wanted, but did I do something wrong? She's really upset and saying she doesn't want to be a part of my wedding anymore.",0
"Update 2: One of my sisters-in-law gave me more details about why she thought I was TA. Turns out Jerry told our brothers/SILs some very different things than what he told me. I sent her screenshots of the texts that Jerry and I exchanged over the weekend and the past few days. Now she and her husband (my oldest brother) are furious at Jerry.

What we have here is a family of bad communicators (including me) and at least one person (Jerry and possibly also Jessica) who is manipulating/making stuff up.

Update 1: For those who have asked:

* I was not invited to be a bridesmaid because all the other women in their 20s in the wedding party are married, and I am not. Jerry's exact words when he texted me this weekend (so two weeks after he originally told me) were that I would be ""the weird one out.""
* According to Jerry, I was left off the wedding invitation list deliberately, primarily because Jessica felt that I disrespected her by being ""cheap"" (again, Jerry's word) and having a party for her family at my apartment instead of at an upscale venue. (I'm a broke student.)
* Jerry and Jessica went to my apartment to demand an apology for leaving the invitation addressing party without saying goodbye to anyone, and for saying that they were awful to demand free labor. They banged on the door and windows because they were sure that I was home (I wasn't).
* They went to my work to demand the above apology, plus an apology for telling them to not go to my home again, and also for my neighbors calling 911 when they thought I could be in danger.

Throwaway account

My brother ""Jerry"" (M21) and I (F26) were close for most of our lives. We’re two of nine adult children in a very dysfunctional family.

Jerry recently got engaged to ""Jessica"" (F20). I've tried to be welcoming since she started dating my brother, but she hasn't really reciprocated. Once COVID restrictions were lifted, I hosted a ""getting to know you"" party to introduce the women in the two families. I've also taken her family to lunch/dinner several times, and co-hosted a wedding shower for our extended family. I've been careful not to give my opinions on the wedding, and have tried to be supportive as Jerry’s and my parents are causing drama.

Two weeks ago, Jerry called me to say that they were inviting all of their other siblings to be in their wedding party, but they aren’t inviting me. He didn't say why. I told him that I wouldn't be making a fuss and it was their wedding to do with as they choose.

This weekend, Jessica texted me at the last minute to attend an invitation addressing party and to bring a dessert. I was upset at the request (it was a last-minute invitation to a pre-planned event, and they'd already excluded me from their wedding party), but I decided to make cupcakes and stop by briefly.

When I arrived, Jessica handed me a stack of announcements and gift registry cards for the people who aren’t invited to the wedding. She also gave me a list of names and addresses of these people. Lo and behold, my name is on the list of non-wedding invitees. I found the list of wedding invitees, and my name isn't on it so I'm truly not invited.

Here's where I might BTA:

1. After realizing I'm not invited to the wedding, I took my cupcakes and left the invitation-addressing party. I didn't make a scene, but I didn't tell Jessica or her mom (who was hosting) that I was leaving.
2. Jerry texted me about how rude I was to leave when his fiancee needed help, and said I was selfish, spoiled, and cheap. I replied that it was awful for them to demand my help for an event to which I was not invited, and that I wasn't going to be involved in any drama.
3. Jerry and Jessica went to my apartment yesterday while I was gone. They banged on the door and yelled in the windows, so my next-door neighbors (who don't know him called 911. J&J managed to talk their way out of trouble, but texted me angrily. I told them they caused a disturbance in my building and not to come over again.
4. J&J came to my work today, told the receptionist we had a family emergency, and made her pull me out of a meeting. Once it was clear that no one was dead or injured, I told them to leave and not come to my work again.

My entire family thinks I'm the asshole. I think the bride and groom can determine who they want to invite to their wedding/bridal party, but they can’t demand unpaid time, labor, and hosting from non-invitees.

TL;DR: I'm not invited to my brother's wedding, but he and fiancée want my help with the events around it and made public scenes at my home/work.",0
"My son (28) was visiting us for a couple days and was at my house alone babysitting my daughters kid.

According to my son, the other day my 4-year-old granddaughter (his niece) pulled down the TV and broke it. My son told us that he took the TV to the dump as it was shattered and useless. My daughter and son-in-law (my 4yo granddaughters parents) felt very bad for what had happened and paid the cost of the TV that day.

My husband was watching our security cameras and our son's story doesn't hold up. We never see our granddaughter breaking the TV. All that we see is our son taking away the TV that is not shattered. We asked our son about this and he said that the security camera must have cut out the part that shows our granddaughter breaking the TV.

Eventually I got a call from my son's girlfriend that lives with him. She said that she knew what was going on and felt guilty. She basically told us that our son had made up the story about the TV breaking and stole it and took it to their house to watch. 

I filed a police report and his girlfriend let the police into their house to get us our TV back. We do plan on pressing charges against him. He stole our TV and made my daughter pay for it. That is messed up on so many levels. AITA for pressing charges?",0
"In Jamaica at a resort. I’m laying in a cabana with my son by the pool. Was approached aggressively by a  gentleman (Jim) saying that he had reserved this cabana by the pool for him and his wife. I calmly asked him if he had reserved this cabana with the front desk. Jim claims that he doesn’t have to and that his two note pool towels in the cabana was his reservation. I kindly referred him to the clear signage all over the pool area that you are not allowed to reserve the cabanas and sun loungers with your personal items and that unattended items will be removed. He asked who removed them. I said I did once I saw that no one had sat in or used this cabana for over two hours. Jim gets all huffy and he tells me I need to leave. I again calmly tell him I will not be leaving this cabana as I’m here and using it and him “reserving” it with some pool towels was not allowed as per hotel policy. If he would like me to remove myself and my belongings he can plead his case to hotel staff and see what they have to say about it. He called me a fucking asshole in front of my 5 year old and stormed off. I don’t feel particularly great about this whole ordeal but AITA in this situation? 
Thanks AITA aficionados!",0
"My boyfriend and I had moved in together. He's a gamer but I never joined him for that, I have a desk job now, and by the end of the day I'm sick of sitting at a computer desk grinding away at something! 

So I first saw him play after we moved in together.

And what I heard definitely felt.. bad. He used a lot of really sexist and homophobic insults like saying that other players were bitches, calling stuff gay or the f-slur, making suggestive or agressive sexist comments if there was a girl in the game.

I told him how I felt. And he was trying to say that it was normal guy talk. That this is how guys talk when there aren't women around.

Now, I know what normal guy talk is. Last two places I've worked, I've been the only woman on the team. And I'd go out with coworkers plenty and we'd all often get drunk enough they didn't give two shits if they were talking in front of a ""lady"". Not to mention all the times I went walking around on the shop floor in full PPE including a respirator with my short hair and no makeup, with guys not even realizing I was a chick. And I know that shit isn't normal guy talk.

Hell, even when a guy did say some homophobic or sexist crap at work to me (I'm a bi woman who dresses pretty masculine at work) a lot of the team would tell whoever said it to shut the fuck up and get the fuck out if they were gonna be a bitch to me.  Like even in a room of all guys who like shit talking plenty, being a bigot still didn't fly. Chill guys just don't attack people just cause of their gender or sexuality.

I told my boyfriend all that, saying I know normal guy talk from work and this ain't it. And that he wasn't being ""a guy"" he was being a bigot. 

He said it was, that I just didn't know because guys would be different around me. 

I asked him 'what about all the times guys on the shop floor thought I was a dude until I opened my mouth?"" And he said he didn't think that happened. 

I told him it did and literally all the guys he thought were too ""rough around the edges"" and total macho douchebags that I have worked with... Were still a shit ton more respectful than he was being. And honestly I had more respect for someone who says it like it is... Than how he was acting two faced; acting all progressive and nice and soft-spoken around me and dropping slurs left and right with his friends. 

He said he was way more respectful to me than the guys at work ever were and I told him that he wasn't and if he didn't understand that, I was moving out. 

He got really defensive and I had my friend come by with her truck that night. I'm renting a room in a friends share house now and I'm not sure if the relationship will survive. 

He's getting mad at me saying I overreacted majorly. I'm upset also, I'm saying he needs to fix that shit if he wants to repair our relationship.

AITA for moving out?",0
"This is such a ridiculous situation that I feel like an AH just for posting, but my wife is legitimately peeved, so Reddit, tell me if I'm too blinded by amusement to see clearly or if this is objectively funny and not worth punishing our kid about.

My 43M dad 64M used to love taking us on adventures as kids, but he's slowed down recently. He still loves spending time with my daughter, 12F. Okay, so Dad decided to introduce daughter to his favorite childhood shows, and for whatever reason, SHE. LOVES. THEM. Star Trek, Bonanza, the Andy Griffith show, all of it. She's hooked. She thinks it's all fantastic.

Okay, fun fact about my daughter, she loves googling ""fun facts."" Her favorite phrase is ""did you know?"" Like we'll drive past a sign saying we're x miles from some location and she whips out that phone and is like ""did you know x location is the salamander capital of the world?"" It's really cute and annoying at the same time.

So last week she comes downstairs and says ""did you know ABC made Burt Ward take pills to shrink his *****?"" Totally deadpan. Didn't even crack. When I tell you, I WHEEZED. She showed me the article, and yep, they did. The 60s, what a time. Wife was mad. She told daughter to never use that word or we were going to wash her mouth out with soap (empty threat). Daughter pouted and went about her day.

Next day, she told dad, who didn't believe her at first and then absolutely lost it when he read the article she pulled up. I can't remember the last time I saw him laugh that hard. Wife came out, heard what the commotion was about and told daughter if she brought it up again, she was in big trouble.

Well today, one of my wife's friends called while the girls were having a playdate and you'll never guess what my daughter did. You'll never guess in a million years. Go on. Guess. Yeah, she told the story to her little friend, who also thought it was hilarious. Mother did NOT.

Wife is furious now and says we need to come up with a punishment. I don't want to punish her. I think if we stop making a big deal about it, she'll get bored of it eventually. Wife's argument is that she's doing it for attention. Duh. She's twelve. But she's gonna learn about this stuff in health class soon anyway. Might as well get the giggles out of her system now.

AITA for not supporting my wife and dragging my heels on punishing daughter. Wife says even if I'm right, we at least need to punish her for disobeying us. I say, the harder we come down, the more she will push back.

Small update:

Wife and I did end up agreeing by the time daughter was dropped off not to punish her. Instead, we reiterated some sex ed stuff and told her it's important to keep subject matter appropriate to situation. She was receptive to these messages.

Dad comes over for dinner almost every day, and he usually shows up early. So he got here half an hour ago, and daughter set up the TV and they start watching Batman on Tubi (ofc). Five minutes in, Dad leans over to daughter.

Dad: [daughter's name]

Daughter: Yeah, Grampa?

Dad: I can see Robin's *****.

Daughter and Dad both lost it. I look at wife. Her face is totally blank. I can tell she's seething on the inside. She says she's going to take a bubble bath. She's still in there. IDK if I should bring her a glass of wine to mellow her out or leave her the hell alone. Thanks Dad.",0
"My friend (21f) and I (23f) met up with a guy she just started seeing this weekend, and honestly he seemed really nice and I really approved of him over all. We were at a bar and decided we would leave and go somewhere else and while we were deciding, the guys she's seeing put his hand on my thigh and asked where I wanted to go. He did this right infront of her and it made me really uncomfortable but I shook it off. Once we got to the other bar, he approached me again and tried to dance with me and spun me around. I have alot of boundaries with touch when it comes to my friends partners, and when he did that I once again felt really uncomfortable but didn't say anything because it didn't feel right bringing it up. Once I told my own boyfriend about it he got really angry, and told me I should tell her. And another friend told me I should say something too, so I did. She seemed really defensive and told me she doesn't think he's ""coming on"" to me. I don't think he was either but it was uncomfortable for me, and I just wanted to let her know about it. I don't know if I did the right thing here, and I'm starting to regret bringing it up.",0
"I got hired for this salaried job where they really hyped up the work life balance and reasonable hours in the job interview. Like the way that they never expect people to stay late or work on weekends or holidays. 

That turned out to be BS. My boss got my personal phone number off my resume from when I applied and after not long he was blowing up my phone on nights and weekends asking me to come work.

I'd always not answer then when he'd ask on Monday why I wasn't answering my phone, I'd pull out my work phone like ""sorry, are you sure you had the right number? I'm not seeing any missed calls"" and he'd often say he called my own cell so I'd say that I don't really use it much, I leave it home a lot, and when I do check it I've usually got like 40 missed calls and my voicemail is always full so I probably miss stuff unless I'm expecting a call at a certain time. And that if he needs to reach me he should try my work phone because I'm very careful to follow up on any call to that within 1 business day.

He asked me how he could reach me outside of 9 to 5 because he sees I leave my work phone on my desk at night and over the weekend. I said that honestly I'm not glued to any phone on the weekend so if he needs me to take a call on the weekend, could he make it a meeting request and put it on my calendar, so I know to be available. Or if I know I won't be available to take a call, I can suggest an alternate time to call. 

He said that wasn't really gonna work for him, more often things come up last minute and when he calls people on the weekend it wasn't planned. And that he's not calling for a teleconference meeting, he's calling asking people to come in. 

I said that on the weekends I usually have commitments that were made one to three weeks out and I'm not often able to cancel a previous commitment with under a day notice. So if he needs me in on a weekend it'd be best if he could schedule that three weeks out so that I know not to make conflicting plans.

He said that wasn't possible and I said okay, he could try and reach out and I'd answer the phone if I heard it ringing, but I wasn't always on the phone so I might not catch it always

Anyway, I've gone back to ignoring his calls and my coworkers have gotten kinda frustrated with me saying that coming in on weekends is part of the job and that I wasn't pulling my weight. I said that I don't know what job they signed on for but in my job interview I was promised regular hours and took my pay based on regular hours so I'm working regular hours. 

My coworkers got frustrated and said that if everyone did what I was doing nothing would get done. I said maybe nothing should get done then, if it's coming at the cost of y'all not being home for dinner with the family. 

I don't really think my coworkers see it as an option to say no, so they're angry at me because I'm doing it and they're not comfortable doing it 

AITA for not working evenings or weekends?",0
"I live in a college town in an apartment complex across the street from campus. Like literally walk across the street and you're next to the fence of the track field. I really like our apartment, it's nothing fancy but we've really made it our own.

 Now, onto the problem. We have noise sensitive neighbors. Ever since the new season of Rupauls drag race started airing my roommate and I have been hosting weekly watch parties on Friday nights. And every time we host we get a knock on our door asking to keep it down. Our rent is cheap so our walls are made of paper so any noise that does seep through the walls can be annoying. However, we only have about 4-6 people over once a week on a Friday night, we don't blast music, we live on the first floor, and anytime we even think we might be getting too loud we quickly shush each other and turn down the tv volume (although I admit we tend to stay up late, we are either watching something with the volume low or just having casual conversation). 

I'm getting frustrated because it's a college town on a Friday night in an apartment complex less than a block from campus and I have never once complained about my upstairs neighbors jam sessions with their band when I'm studying, or my next door neighbors having loud sex at midday when I'm trying to nap. I get needing to get up early for work and anytime someone knocks on our door we either leave or just call it a night. I have had my fair share terribly loud neighbors but it's just apartment life, pop in some earbuds or headphones. Maybe I should invest in some soundproofing... AITA?",0
"Before I start this I want to make everyone aware that I have fully medically transitioned. Ive had Top Surgery, Ive been on Testosterone for almost 7 years now and I fully pass as a male. So Im a nanny, I sadly had a really hard time in school when I was younger due to my mental health and couldn't keep up with my schoolwork causing me to not be able to get into college.  So I decided instead of going to community college I would use the money I saved for college from working to fully medically transition. It was great, I had finally felt good in my body and was truly happy for the first time. Money was scarce and I love kids so I decided to start babysitting. One of my First jobs Was a nice single mom, we'll call her Lily. Her husband had died pretty early on in the pregnancy so she's been alone from the start. Her kid- Lets call him Ryan is a a pretty hyper kid. And Before you say ""Isn't every kid a little hyper?"" no. I mean this kid is ***hyper*** like he is bounce off the walls hyper. So when she came home one night from a long night at work to a peaceful sleeping child she was overjoyed, and she has continuously told me that is one of the main reasons she hired me. I quickly became Ryan's full time nanny. Teaching His mom How to make things like brushing his teeth or eating fun for him. She always praises me and tells me what good of a man I am and how she is so impressed on how feminine and motherly I am to children. Which yes, kinda rubbed me the wrong way.

My mother every once and awhile comes and visits, and this past weekend she was in town so she decided to come visit. We were walking around the local farmers market catching up when we ran into Ryan and his mom. I have weekends off but it is always nice to see Ryan outside of when i'm babysitting him so I went and said hi and introduced the two to my mom. Lily and my mom hit it off immediately and my mom asked that they become facebook friends. Now I don't have facebook  so Ive never actually seen my moms posts. So It was my surprise when Lily sent me a Facebook post about my transition- made by my mom. Lily went off on me, She started cursing me out, calling me slurs of all kind, and telling me I should be ashamed of myself. She told me that The only reason she hired me was because I was a Man and she wanted for Ryan to have a father figure in his life. She continued to lecture me about ""how ill always be a woman."" and how she cant believe she let a monster touch her child. I am shattered. I cant believe that this woman that I trusted and that was becoming one of my closest friends was a transphobic monster. I have been cut out from her and Ryans life completely and she has blocked me on everything.

I admit I know it was wrong to not tell her that I was trans but I consider that something very private due to it being something that I can get harmed for. I know it is not my fault for what Lily believes but I still feel guilty about letting Ryan live with that woman. AITA?

"I have 2 kids, 2f, 4f. I fucking hate how everyone thinks of me as being just a mommy now. I don’t get to be my own person. I’m just mommy.

Husband doesn’t face this. He gets gifts from everyone that have to do with his hobbies. Me? I get a bunch of mommy shit. Tee hee, mommy needs wine! 

And like matching outfits. I don’t mean like, one of those cutesy matching pajama sets that the nurses and horse girls wear in their staged Christmas insta pics. I mean like, people actually think I’m going to go out in public wearing some cutesy matching outfits with my toddlers. As though I think they’re mini versions of myself? Or dolls?

From the time we got to the in-laws, it was “mama” this and “mama” that. At some point, my SIL said it and I said “You know my name is (Carmen), right?” she just looked at me funny and said “Of course, silly?” I said “So why do you keep calling me “mama”? You aren’t going around calling (husband) papa?” SIL just looked at me like I had 2 heads and was like “Um, okay.” 

This went on all over Christmas. Here you go, mama. Want another slice, mama? 

At that point I was just like “Do you guys mind calling me by my name instead of calling me mama?”

The same SIL as before did the whole golly-gee doe eyed thing and said “But you’re such a good mama!”

I said that I’m not JUST a mom. I gestured to the things that husband got for Christmas from them, and said “Why didn’t you guys get him anything that says  “papa”? Everything you gave me is somehow related to me being a mom. Why does HE get to be his own person?”

MIL grabbed my hand and squeezed it and said that she was sorry that she made me feel like this. She was just “so excited” about being a grandma and she never really thought of things like that.

I was feeling a little better until SIL2 and SIL3 started going after me. One of them did that whole “Are you okay? Do you need to talk someone? You sound so angry, it isn’t healthy” faux concern thing that’s meant to shame you for having any emotional response.

The other one was angry and saying that “is being a mom somehow beneath you” and “do you think you’re better than the rest of us?” and all that.

When we finally left, he asked me why I’d kept it in for so long, and I said that I haven’t. No one listened to me before. I’ve said these things plenty of times. I’ve always asked them to call me by my name and not some disgusting nickname that boils me down to giving birth. He nodded, but said that I’d put a big pallor on the weekend and that I need to apologize for the outburst at some point.

I said sure, as soon as SILs apologize to me for dehumanizing me for years. 

We’re at a stalemate. AITA?",0
"**throwaway account**

Okay so I first met my friend *Jane (F29) studying abroad. We were really good friends during our travels and after college we actively stayed in touch visiting each other in our respective different cities.

I met her bf *Bob (now husband) when they first started dating and have met her college friends and parents.

Bob and Jane decided to move to my city right before Covid so during lockdown we were in each others bubbles - we’ve celebrated each others birthdays, we’ve had Friendsgiving, Christmas parties together etc.

2021 Bob and Jane got engaged in August and when they came back I threw them a engagement party. I bought her this wine glass that said “wedding planning wine glass” and every time she used it she would text me a photo of her with it.

In 2022 I threw Bob a 30th birthday party - but then this was also the first year I wasn’t invited to her birthday.

I had texted Bob asking what the plan was and he told me they were going out of the state for her birthday - however on instagram I seen them posting pictures of them renting a cabin with some friends…so I felt awkward.

Then I wasn’t invited to the Bachlorette party - I didn’t find this too big of a deal because Jane has some really close childhood friends and sorority friends but then nothing about the wedding.

The wedding happened this May and it was a big wedding - like 200 people probably and I wasn’t invited. I was really hurt to say the least but I didn’t say anything. I just tried to move on - I haven’t talked to them really since before the wedding - they didn’t wish me a happy birthday and they couldn’t attend my birthday shindig cause they were out of town.

I’m noticing that if I don’t reach out to either of them, they don’t reach out to me at all.

Now Bob has reached out and asked me to plan Jane’s birthday party cause he says “I’m the best at planning these things” and I told him I was hurt about not being invited and he said “well we had limit space don’t make it a big deal we want you to be at her birthday” 

I really don’t want to do it and I don’t really feel any desire to be friends with them - am I being a petty a*hole?

EDIT: to clarify about the Bob’s birthday party - Jane asked me to help plan it - that was the last time I’ve seen them in person (march 2022).",0
"I'm 22 years old. my sister is 26 and has 2 children a 2 month old and a 2 year old. I always thought she should not have gotten another could because she can barely take care of the other one and most of the time asks other people to take care of them because she can't do it alone. Our mom is one of the people who goes and helps allot. Definitely now that the babys born. 

Now for the vacation part. I booked a vacation to the beach a year ago it was quite expensive. But this is something I really wanted so i saved up for it. I asked our mom if she wanted to go with me. She said yes I booked and payed for 2 people. A month before we left for the vacation. My mom said my sister was also coming with us because her boyfriend was away that same week on a bike vacation. 

There wasn't really a question in it they just announced it. Afterwards i went to our mom and said my concerns about how i was afraid i would have no time for myself and i would have to babysit all the time. ( Something about me I'm high sensitive and i get overwhelmed very quickly by constant loud noice and being an introvert being around people mentally drained me to the point i can't do anything anymore but just sleep. They know this)

Where now 4 days into the vacation. And everything i feared came true. I have to constantly keep my 2 year old busy while my mom and sister are on there phone or taking care of the baby. Even when I go somewhere else to be alone for a second like lay on my bed or something he follows and keeps asking to play. I love him but it get to much for me. The only way they leave me alone is when Im sleeping so i have been doing that allot. With makes that i wasn't able to do anything that i wanted. 

My sisters told me today I'm Ruining her vacation because I make a long face all the time. I don't know if that's an English expression but in dutch it mean I'm not happy all the time. 

I was so annoyed i told her what do you mean ruining your vacation i paid for it. This is my vacation. She began yelling and said that just because i paid for everything doesn't mean I can sit here and ruin it for her. I said you invited yourself i didn't ask you to be here. And said that they promised I would not have to babysit. She began yelling louder and said i haven't touched the baby while we where here (that's a lie i have given him his bottle a few times and held him while he slept and cried plenty of times.) I told her who has been keeping the 2 year old busy. She got more angry and said isn't that normal for you to want to play with the 2 year old as his aunt. Our mom was looking at me like I've kicked the children. Because how could I complain about playing with my own nephew. They stormed out and yelled that there really something wrong with me and i should think about what i said. 

I've been crying non stop and have no clue what to do anymore. They don't talk to me. And I'm stuck here with them until Friday. 

Am i the asshole?",0
"


Pleased read the full story.

My husband's brother (BIL 37) and his wife (SIL 35) struggled with infertility for years after trying so much for long they decided to stop. But started...sort of living the experience of having a child by doing the things that parents do like getting a nursery (they removed it now) buying bany cothes, toys, attending school shows etc etc.


I'm 7 months pregnant, and BIL & SIL has been asking many questions on what's it like to be expecting. It was bothersome with them getting involved but I grin & bear til they requested to be with me in the delivery room to experience child birth. I said no and stood firm but later discovered that my husband ""volunteered"" his place to give his brother and his wife both a chance to have this experience. We had a fight and I told him off.

BIL & SIL came over later to try to ""talk me"" into it, I nicely said no but they pushed me so I blew up telling them their fertility problems aren't my fault (harsh I know and regret saying it) and told them to get therapy. Sil started crying, Bil asked me take time to think but I rudely said there was nothing to think about and my mind's already been made. 


They left and my husband starte raging, after yelling at me about how this is his child too and how rude and dismissive I was to his grieving and strugglig brother and wife, he told me to look him in the eyes and tell him if I would be happy to ruin his brother's marriage when I can do this small, yet graceful deed and help BIL and wife ""process"" their trauma and finally make peace with it. I felt so much anger I cried, he told me to get over myself already and stop being purposefully selfish and petty.

We're not talking now and he says it stays this way til I say yes, I might've acted cruel but I just wanted him as the father of my child to be with me and don't feel comfortable with BIL & SIL being there.",0
"My ex (35M) and I (36f)divorced last year. In the beginning we were pretty civil;things have changed & he's pretty hostile with me. We have 2 kids together. 

I have primary custody of our kids and have them about 75% of the time. The decree states the kids are to go to school in the zone based on my residence. Since I had moved out after our divorce, I'm in a new school zone. I have made him aware over the summer I need to follow the decree& transfer. He was very against this. Ultimately it's my decision but I try to get his input before decisions are made. I made sure the kids were okay with this transition to a new school, then registered them for school. I texted him to tell him they were now registered for the new school. No response. 

The next day the school had a ""meet the teacher night."" I texted him the teachers' name. No response. One of our daughters wanted a pink streak in her hair, I texted him to ask if he was okay with that, no response. There were a few other texts I sent with no response from him. 

I thought this was so bizarre bc pretty much all summer he's been harassing me. bc of this I have retained a lawyer to do a modification so a judge makes us use a parenting app to text.It *should* limit the harassment and abusive texts. 

AM of the 1st day of school came & I was getting the kids ready for school. My phone was dnd. Checked the time & I had 17 missed calls from 7am - 7:25. Then he called again. I told him I'm doing their hair but I'll put you on speaker. He starts berating me telling me I ruined this special moment for him and he wanted to see them off. He made it seem to the kids that I intentionally left him out of loop. Even tho our homes are in diff school zones, he lives close. I told him we are leaving for school in 10 min & he can meet us there. We hung up, I texted him the teachers' names again

He didn't show up. Later I got many abusive texts. He said I ""f-ed up"" his chance to see them off. He told me he needs to take custody of the kids for ""what I've done"". I asked why he waited until the morning of the first day of school to make arrangements w me.He said he blocked me bc I called his new gf's son a friend of our kids instead of brother. My kids had never said brother but call him a BFF. He said I disrespected him & his family & this was my punishment. Him blocking me is like, #GOALS. /s bc I know the kids need contact w him, but it was nice those few days not hearing from him. 

I feel like this is completely on him. Had he not blocked me, he would have received important texts regarding the kids and info on their new school and teachers' names. He also could have made arrangements the night prior after he was done ""punishing"" me (lol). All he did was punish himself and his children. What if there had been an emergency? 

I could be blinded by my frustration w him, but I need to know, AITA?",0
"I (f29) am a huge nerd and bookworm so my books collection ir rather impressive.

My boyfriend of 3 years (David, m32) and I have just moved in together and it proves to be more challenging that I originally thought it would be.

 

As mentioned above, my book collection is rather large but he never mentioned anything about it and the books will be in my office anyway (I work from home). However, there seems to be a slight issue he has (always had?) that he only now mentioned.

I was raised trilingual, and I learned English later in life as well, so technically I speak four languages with English being my weakest so apologies for any mistakes. Because of that, my book collection is rather diverse, including books in all four’languages. If I can, I prefer to read the book in a language it was originally written in and only reach for translations if I don’t speak the language. 
This has never been a problem and David never mentioned anything about this until now.

He was helping me unpack the books and I had noticed that he put all non-English books in a separate pile. I asked him about that and he said we didn’t need them and to throw them away. 
I said that you never throw books away, you donate them instead but I didn’t plan on getting rid off any of my books.

He argued that it was pointless to keep books not in English as they only take up space and they’re only for show and no one but me even reads them.

I told him “r hey’re my books, I could consider downsizing my collection if it was a space issue but since we have the space and they’re in my office, I am not getting rid off them.”

He got really annoyed so I told him that I didn’t need his help anymore.

Yesterday, I went for a coffee with a friend and when I got back home, I found my book shelves to be mostly empty with some candles and figurines placed where my books used to be.

I asked David where my books were and he told me it was a surprise and I came back home to early. His mother came over and help him get rid of all my ‘useless’ books. The bagged them up, put it in his car and he was about to take them to the skip. I was absolutely furious and he told me I could always replace them with books in English.

I grabbed all my books and went to my office. I installed a lock to my office door so he can’t throw them away but I am so very confused about all of this. To top this off, his sisters called me, one of them screaming her head off because I am an inconsiderate c-word and to get off my high horse and to stop pretending I am better than everyone else. Am I the asshole here? Am I really wrong about not wanting to get rid off my books?",0
"I (17M) don't have a close relationship with my dad. I would go as far as saying he doesn't even really deserved to be called my dad. My bio dad, yes, sure, he is biologically my father. But he was never a dad to me. When I was younger he was always working on spending time with his buddy's. He'd go on vacations with friends but not with us. He wasn't even around for my birthdays.

My mom got sick when I was 9 and my dad was all emotional about it when he found out. He wasn't around when she was diagnosed so he was the last to find out. But he didn't change. It was only when she died a year later that he was distraught when she died. He tried to fight over not taking her body and then for 3 years he didn't take care of himself and lost his job and everything. His parents helped him pay bills and groceries while my maternal grandparents took care of me. He wasn't around. He wasn't a good dad. He mourned mom and pleaded for forgiveness but never took the time to be a better dad. He just regretted not being better to mom.

He slowly got his shit together and two years ago he met Helena and they got married a year ago. Helena has two kids 5f and 4m. They don't have dad's in their lives and my dad has stepped up to be a great dad to the two of them. He takes them to the park, he buys them stuff, he reads to them, helps with her daughter's reading and stuff. All the kinds of things an actual parent would do. All stuff he never did with me. When I saw him do that stuff with them, I decided that as soon as I was 18 I was out of here and would never look back. I don't care if he changes now, I won't ever be okay with him being a good dad to kids who aren't his before he tries with me.

The only reason he started reaching out is because Helena's daughter wants me to be her brother and seeks me out. So I avoid being around. The few times I was around and she asked me to do something I said no. She'd get upset so dad would try to invite me along and when it didn't work, he suggested we have ""boys nights"" with Helena's son. Then two weeks ago dad and Helena told her kids to invite me to a ""sibling movie night"" and when the kids were out of earshot I told them they are not my siblings and I am not theirs.

A week ago dad tried to talk to me about how distant I am and how I refuse to interact. He told me I'm being really hard on him. I told him he was never a good dad to me and why would I give him an easy time. I said why would I like seeing him be a dad to them when he never was to me. He tried to defend it. I told him he isn't even their real dad but he was mine. Dad accused me of dumping on him. Then Helena interjected and told me I shouldn't dismiss her kids and my dad's relationship like that and shouldn't be so hard on him over it. I told her none of this concerned her and she needed to stay out of it. They told me I was being a dick and shouldn't hate that Helena's kids have a dad and I should be glad for them and shouldn't be so disrespectful.

"I (33M) recently decided to delete my WhatsApp account for personal reasons, including privacy concerns and a desire to reduce screen time. I communicated my decision to my family, providing alternative ways to stay in touch (e.g., Signal, landline phone calls).  
However, some family members, especially the older ones, have expressed significant anger and frustration over my decision. They feel I've disconnected from them, making it harder for the family to stay in constant contact.   
Despite my efforts to explain my reasoning and ensure we remain connected through other means, the backlash has been strong, leading to arguments and accusations of selfishness.  
I understand change can be hard, but I also feel it's important to make choices that align with my well-being and values.   
AITA for prioritising my preferences and privacy over the convenience of family group chats?

"I (18M) am the oldest of four kids. And frankly, I hate it. I was diagnosed with Autism when i was 16, but my younger brother (8), was diagnosed at a much younger age. Because of that, I was seen as ""copying"" him. I was definitely not. To my parents, I don't ""act"" autistic, whatever that is supposed to mean. 

Anyway, me and my brother, as stupid as it may sound because of the age  gaps, don't really get along. He has developed a mindset where he can push just enough to not get in trouble, but push me and my siblings buttons. He understands the word no. He understands the word stop. Does he listen though? Not at all. This is because of my parents. They constantly use the excuse that ""he doesn't understand what he's doing"" and are always telling me to read a book on autism. 

My brother CHOOSES not to respect boundaries. You can tell him no nicely or not, and his response will be to tell you to shut the f* up. (thank you mother for telling me to do that enough time for him to get it.) Today i reached the limit when he was constantly grabbing at my crotch and running away laughing. I kept gently shoving him away with my foot and telling him to stop, and my mom got pissed off and yelled that he doesn't understand when i said he shouldn't be doing that, and proceeded to call me an asshole of a sister. (I am a transmale, my mother is extremely transphobic as well.) 

You can see my problem with this. He's gonna grow up to think touching people inappropriately is okay and my mom is gonna cry and say ""He doesn't understand!"" when they are sitting in a courtroom. Am i the asshole for any of this? I've been trying to teach him right from wrong and i get yelled at.",0
"
Just a heads up: we don’t live in a western country, so please try to see it from a non-Western perspective, instead of bashing the culture, focus on the specific issues.

*******************

My father died many years ago, and my mother didn’t remarry. She is now in a good political position, something like a mayor in Western countries.

For the last couple of years, she has been seeing one of her old classmates. The thing is, she is trying to keep this relationship under the wraps, but they’re not very good at technology. I never snoop through her phone, but sometimes use it when she asks me to, and you can very easily see his messages coming up while working on the phone. 

Yesterday she asked me to use her phone and I noticed they’ve been unsending/deleting messages to each other, I think they’ve been sending each other nudes or pictures like that. I found that they’ve been booking hotels too, which I can only imagine is for sex. 

As much as I hate seeing my mom with this person, and finding these explicit things, I cannot really stop her because she’s a grown woman and it’s her decision, I can’t stop her from seeing someone just because he creeps me out because I can’t force her to be alone for the rest of her life just for me. 

But the thing is, if these pictures ever get out, she’ll be in big trouble. Because of their callousness, people have already started to suspect things, one of her other schoolmates has told her to not become like our last mayor, who had to retire because of a sex. I don’t trust the guy, I wouldn’t put it past him to save the photos or record their time together just for the thrill of it. My mom has dated other people in the past (I found out the same way) and so it won’t be surprising if she loses interest on him and moves on. And I fear he might start blackmailing her with the pictures or videos when he faces rejection. He just really gives me bad vibes, my uncle who has just started to get a whiff of things has also never liked him before, and finds him problematic. 

So will I be TA if I just tell her that I don’t want to talk about her relationship, but she should try to be more careful as she’s not tech savvy and might not even realize that she’s putting herself in danger? If the people in our town find out she will have to leave politics and might be socially ostracised too. I will specifically tell her that this isn’t about the morality or ethics of the situation, and simply about the political strategy, will that be too bad?",0
"I (F30) absolutely love chocolate mousse, I will choose it every time it is an option, and it has been my birthday dessert every year since I was eight years old. I know there are other birthday dessert options out there, but why mess with a delicious tradition?

I gave birth to my beautiful baby boy three days ago, and he was born a week after my birthday. Given that I can't have raw eggs during the pregnancy, chocolate mousse was off limits for this birthday. My husband (M31) asked if I wanted to celebrate my birthday on the day with a different dessert, but I said that I would rather wait and do a proper birthday celebration with the baby, and I can then have my chocolate mousse, as per.

My husband agreed and said that he would plan something low key, but it would be nice to be able to celebrate my birthday with the baby. To be honest, this was something I was really looking forward to doing as a new family of three.

The hospital released me yesterday, and my husband had organised for flowers and some balloons to be delivered to the house in the afternoon. This was really nice of him, and it was nice to do something small for my birthday with the baby.

I thanked my husband for doing this for me, and we had a wonderful time together with the baby while we got all settled. Once we had everything sorted, I quickly popped out to the shops to get some milk and bread and saw that they had chocolate mousse cups. I bought some thinking my husband and I could have some birthday dessert. Especially seeing as my husband hadn't organised any dessert or sweets.

When I got home with the chocolate mousse, my husband immediately got upset saying that I clearly didn't appreciate the celebration he threw for me, and that I had gone to the shops with an ""alterior motive."" I told him no, I appreciated his effort, but I saw chocolate mousse at the shops and that had been the only thing I had really wanted, so I bought it. I had figured he couldn't get any on relatively short notice so it wasn't an issue for me to buy some for myself.

My husband said he had actually not bought chocolate mousse on purpose because ""if the raw eggs aren't good during pregnancy, then they would be just as bad when breastfeeding."" I told him that he didn't get to make that choice for me, and I didn't understand why he couldn't stick to our agreement. All I wanted was chocolate mousse, and I had been very clear about that when we had discussed birthday plans. If he had a concern, he could have raised it with me then instead of just deciding that I don't get chocolate mousse.

My husband told me that I was letting my hormones get the better of me, because it was unreasonable to be this argumentative about chocolate mousse. I was quite dismissive of this when I spoke to him, but the more I think about it, the more I think I was maybe being a bit too dramatic and I could have gone one birthday without chocolate mousse. Was I the AH?",0
"Throwaway so it’s not linked to my main. 

I went back to my parents house to handle some family affairs for a month and had a nice couple, we’ll call them B and A, watch my house and plants. I live in a cold climate so I explained to B and A that the house needs to be lived in and heat turned on regularly (tiny home with a pellet stove as only heat source) in order for it not to freeze. I’m on well water so I can’t leave the faucet running as others do to prevent freezing. 

The agreement was that they would stay in the house and were given full access to everything, including my new  car to drive. About a quarter of the way through my trip I get a message that they had just gotten back to the house and that the water won’t turn on- pipes were frozen. Come to find out that they hadn’t actually been staying at the house so the heat hadn’t been on for who knows how many days. Of course multiple pipes had burst- I am still waiting to find out the extent of the damage but have already purchased one expensive replacement part.  

A week later, the car ‘dies’. I am told that the battery died from the cold and it needs a new one. A new car with a new battery… I have never had a problem with the car battery in cold weather, including colder temps than what they saw while I was gone. Not being able to troubleshoot anything from afar, I bought a new battery.  

My plants are ruined. I had about 40 houseplants that I have had for years, all frozen and dead. Not a huge monetary loss there, but a sentimental one for sure. 

I am really upset to have trusted these people with my home only to return to this devastation, not to mention the added stress while I was away. 

AITA for not paying the full amount that we had agreed on beforehand?",0
"I (26f) got braces a few months ago. My orthodontist’s office has different contests every month (for example: guess how many marbles are in the jar) where patients can win gift cards or toys.

At my most last appointment I decided to enter the contest (the first time I had done this). I didn’t think it was that big of a deal— I’ve seen other adults do it— but when I mentioned it to my sister she said that I’m an asshole because the contests are meant for kids and if I won then I would be stealing prizes from children.

But does this really make me an asshole? Should I just not enter the contests from now on?  I feel dumb even asking this, but I’m not good with social situations and I genuinely don’t know if it’s rude for me to enter. I’m a patient there, and there are a lot of other adult patients, so I don’t see how what I did is wrong. My sister is making me doubt myself though. AITA?",0
"This isn’t my real account I made another one for this post.

So for starters, I’m 15F. I have always dealt with awful body image and have eating disorder tendencies. Although I haven’t ever been diagnosed with one.

My mom today made a comment in passing about how tight my yoga pants are fitting and she made a comment a couple days ago about how I should start exercising again because my butt was “flabby”. 

Today, that was my final straw. She has always made comments in passing about my body so today I tried to sit down, in a calm voice, and firmly tell her to stop making comments about me and my yoga pants. And I did tell her exactly that until she abruptly cuts me off, and tells me how cruel I am to make her feel bad now, especially since she’s already been feeling down recently.

She’s now giving me the cold shoulder and I do feel bad for bringing that up at such a bad time in her life right now but her constantly making negative comments on my body makes me feel even worse. I don’t know how to deal with it cause I already hate how I look.

So Reddit, AITA?",0
"A little context, my (28M) wife (27F) received a very large sum of money from her parents to use as a down payment on a new property. I wasn't in a financial position to commit to a mortgage because I'm a student, and I plan on being a student for the next couple years. While I have a little bit of income through scholarships and part time work, it's nowhere near enough to commit to that kind of purchase. My wife decided that if I didn't want to commit to a mortgage, that she would just buy the property herself, and use the income from her other property (that her parents bought for her) that she rents out to pay for the new condo. The condition to this was that I had to sign away my legal ownership of the new property, as I would not be paying for it. I agreed, we already have a pre-nup, this just continued the trend of keeping our finances separated. After closing on the property and moving in, my wife then informed me that she needs me start paying the property taxes as a form of ""rent"" for me living there with her, and while we've been splitting rent our whole relationship, it's rubs me the wrong way that she had me give up ownership on the property, but then expects me to help pay for the property. The money going toward taxes may as well be going toward the mortgage, and at that point what is the point of me giving up ownership instead of just owning the condo together? FFS we've been married for years! I feel like I'm being financially exploited. I don't make much money over the summer since I'm not attending summer classes, and she knew that going into it, but in order for her to cover what she owes to the bank she even demanded that I give her the $300 that my parents gave me for my birthday and I told her no! Am I the asshole for refusing to pay?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Previously when we were splitting rent we each paid $1100. When she agreed to buy the condo I agreed to pay for the insurance and all utilities. She wants me to pay her $1400 every month on top of all of the utilities, splitting food, etc.

UPDATE 2: I feel like I need to explain better. I was never expecting to ""not pay anything"". We each have separate bank accounts, but also a mutual bank account. She uses her personal account for the rental income from her other property, I use my personal account for my disability income from the VA. Any income that I would have ""saved"" by not paying rent would be put in one of the joint accounts, as our income from our jobs is shared. While we were renting, it came out of our joint account. My problem is that this is taking money from our joint bank account and putting it in her personal account to then be transferred to the bank for the mortgage, or to pay property taxes or whatever else she decides to do with it.",0
"I pulled onto the highway and proceeded to get tailgated so closely that if I touched the breaks it certainly would have been a wreck. I was in a dump truck (F-550 with a dump bed) and could only see the back tires of her vehicle in my side view mirror. When I pulled out there was clearly enough room for me to pull out safely; at minimum 200 yards between her car and mine with a speed limit of 55mph. She easily could have merged into the other lane seeing that there was little traffic and a clear lane. She tailgates me for an 1/8th mile then merges into the other lane and shoots me the bird. I see she is a delivery driver and is heading back to the restaurant, a place I visit frequently, so I pull in with her to confront her about the situation. As soon as I get out she starts cursing me. I go into the store and talk to the manager and try to explain the situation. The whole time the driver is being loud and super defensive while still cursing me. I stayed calm; the manager recognized me. The manager tries to calm down the delivery driver with little effect. I see it isn't going to help if I continue talking about what happened. I told the driver I understand making deliveries and driving in traffic can be frustrating and perhaps that she was just having a bad day. I ask her to apologize and it would be as nothing happened and I would be on my way about my business. The manager very respectfully asked her to apologize and seemed to be on my side. The driver refused  and said I was in the wrong for pulling out in-front of her and that she wasn't going to apologize. I thanked the manager for listening to me and left without a word. I wrote to the concerns department an email about the situation that night. Today I get a call from their Regional Manager. The RM tells me that the driver has been fired after speaking to the store manager and was concerned that, if not terminated, would have done that again or possibly had done something similar to the situation at hand in the past. I explained to the RM that I didn't want anyone to get fired; more like a write up or something. The RM tells me that she does not meet their quality of customer service or values and see's her as a future liability now. I feel bad, I honestly did not expect her to get fired. I told my friend about the situation and he said ""why shouldn't her actions have consequences?"". AITA?",0
"My friend (20M) and I (19F) both go to school in the US, but we are both in a foreign country in Europe to gain work experience. The internship is unpaid, but the school provided a small stipend to pay rent for those with financial need. My friend and I both got the stipend.

We have a week and a half left here. My friend suddenly told me he needs to fly to Austria to see his mother (he’s a citizen of Austria, but our school is in the US) because she’s sick. She had cancer in the past, and he said they think it might have come back.

He has no more stipend money, so he asked me to loan him $110 for the plane. I found out he’s actually in Paris with his girlfriend. My other friend showed me his private Instagram story. His mom is fine.

I got upset at him since he deceived me, and he admitted it and said “but you wouldn’t have given me the money if I told you the truth.” I said he needs to give me back the money so I can eat, because I’m stuck here another week with basically no money for food. He is ignoring me now, and my other friends are saying it’s warranted because of my harsh words for him.

"My (f26) fiancé (m28) have been together for four years. He’s been friends with “maya” (f30) for six years. They’re fairly close but she doesn’t like me much. It’s usually not an issue, some people just don’t mesh. We don’t mesh. 
Edit to add: there’s no heavy animosity and we can be near each other fine, we just don’t talk when we are. We don’t actively hate each other, just prefer not to hang out together. She isn’t against us getting married and likely would say yes to being a bridesmaid to make him happy but isn’t pushing for it herself 

We’re recently engaged and he’d like her to be a bridesmaid. I don’t. He wants her in a dress matching my bridesmaids, on my side, participating in the things we’re doing. I said absolutely not, she doesn’t even like me. I’ve seen wedding photos where one bridesmaid clearly doesn’t want to be with the bride and I don’t want that. Plus I really only want the women closest to me as bridesmaids. I suggested she wear a black dress to match the men’s tux’s and be a groomsman. He said that will look dumb and he doesn’t want to do that. Because he’s dead set against including her on his side with the men and their activities and I’m dead set against having her with me and my bridesmaids, he’s said I’ve effectively said she can’t be in the wedding. I argued he’s just as much at fault for not budging as I am but he said I’m the one being unreasonable. Mind you his only reason for not wanting her with his groomsmen is “that’s dumb just let her be a bridesmaid.”

"This happened in 2019 but recently came up.

I (21f) live in Canada, and I was planning a trip to my native country in 2019. My cousin (23 at the time) asked if I could bring some items back. She explained that her father's side of the family (unknown to me) was having a wedding, and that buying cultural clothes ([sarees](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0018/4975/3712/products/2247-10671529322240.jpg?v=1571726279)) in our native country is much cheaper than buying it here in Canada. She asked for 6 dresses, and agreed to pay for the items + a little extra for my troubles. I agreed (mostly on the basis that it's for family).

It was a pain. I had to compromise on my own clothing, shopping etc. in order to make space for her stuff. I made it back to Canada and to her credit, she paid me the agreed amount.

Now here's the kicker:

I was scrolling though Instagram a few days later and saw a post from her business page. She sells sarees at a slight discount relative to those sold in Canadian stores. Sure enough, the next few images were the 6 dresses that I had hauled over from 14,000 km away. She called it the 'Wedding collection' and marked everything up, to the point where selling just 3 dresses would cover the full cost of everything I got + the 'inconvenience' amount she provided.

I saw red. She took advantage of my kindness, and even if the wedding was real, she obviously didn't use any of this stuff and it was clear that it was pre-meditated.

This is where I may have been the asshole. In my anger, I immediately commented on her Instagram post, telling the truth about how she lied to me as I brought all this shit back for her, and that I could prove it. Plenty of people DM'd me and I provided.

Within minutes, she called me and gave me an earful about how I just screwed over her entire family because they were depending on this income. She's got two adult brothers (late 20s), and her parents (early 50s). IMO, someone can work. I told her that I would've still helped her if she was honest with me about the business, but that lying to me and adding me to her supply chain is shitty as fuck. The conversation ended, and so did our ties.

Ever since then, her business has seen a considerable decrease in public interaction, and some still leave comments about the shit she pulled. People have thanked me for speaking up, as she had done the same to them, but they stayed quiet to preserve ties. Others have called me an AH for destroying the business of a relative. IMO, the business was destroyed the moment she started slithering, and it was only a matter of time before someone spoke up. I do feel bad if I genuinely screwed over the rest of her family, which is why I'm wondering if I should've just shut up.

So Reddit, was I TA for speaking the truth?

Edit: Wow this is really blowing up! And I understand that there are mixed feelings about it. Don't worry, I recognize that I may have overshot my response to the situation. I'll explain my judgement to bring it up publicly, and hopefully that helps everyone make their decisions.

I can definitely see why I was rash for bringing it up publicly. I do still think that, even though it was an asshole move on my part, dealing with it privately wouldn't have gone anywhere. If I had brought it up to her first, (as from her natural character) there's a big chance she could've blocked me off the only social media that her business is on, so I couldn't have spread the message to the poor souls buying those clothes. I feel like I got very lucky that she screwed up and posted it to the page that I was following. If I had brought it up to her privately, she would've realized her mistake and been more cunning with the way she went about this in the future (i.e. make sure she blocks the ""transporter"" from the page so they have no idea). I felt like I took this one mess up, and didn't let go of the chance.

Also, I think the whole ""she would've used it as a lesson learned"" thing would've only really applied if she was unknowingly doing something wrong, and was willing to take criticism or learn from a situation. However, seeing that she has repeatedly lied to people, (and she was 23 years old at the time as well), it was clear that she was doing this with malicious intent. As in, she knew she was lying, she knew that it was wrong, and still went with it. That didn't sit right with me.

Edit 2: A lot of people are asking why I didn't just say no. I have detailed this a bit more in the comments, but essentially, there was a massive family expectation for me to help her out because of this supposed wedding. There was a lot of pressure and guilt tripping that resulted every time I tried to argue that I needed space in my luggage. Stuff like ""oh you can't do this for family cause you need to shop SOOO much right"", ""if you can't even do this for your cousin, imagine what happens when your parents get old. Guess they'll end up in a senior home cause you can't make space for them too"". It gets brutal and this kind of stuff is deeply rooted in my culture.

My husband (26) is a very particular guy. He has certain things that he deems are a must and will fight tooth and nail for it. Example, never leave any thing in his car. If you go inside with a full and and groceries and leave the receipt by accident, it’s a problem, even if it’s a once in a while things where you forgot.

Another one of these things is his parking spot in the drive way. My brother (18) lives with us. My husband and I both pay for everything equally. And my brother moved in due to unfortunate circumstances from not having reliable parents. He’s generally never home due to always being at work and when he is we usually don’t see him pass the catching up.

My husband have asked my brother in the past to stop parking in his spot in the driveway and to park on the street 5 feet from our mailbox. And he will continually correct him if either of these rules are broken. Recently my husband and I got home from his sisters roller derby game, found my brother and his spot. My brother had stated that he was just pulling in real quick to drop us off some food on the counter and he was about to leave. But my husband wouldn’t have any of it. And stated that he (my brother) is to never park in his (my husband) spot no matter the circumstance. And what does he (husband) need to do to help him (brother) understand it.

Of course in front of my brother I do not say anything and I stand by my husband. But behind closed doors I expressed how angry this had made me and how childish I thought he was being. I told him I understood if my brother was playing at the park there all night, but this is a situation where he was coming here to drop us off some food and was leaving and he didn’t need to be so rude. Let alone have such a ridiculous rule to never ever park in his spot even if it’s just for two minutes. My husband took this as mean not being on his side. And threw it in my face that he pays to live here and my brother lives here for free so he should be able to enforce this.

So am I the asshole for not being able to understand where my husband is coming from.",0
"My dad and I (20F) went to church this past Sunday, and as soon as we sat down, 2 kids (probably 8 or younger) immediately looked at me and whispered to each other. The entire time we were there these kids would just look at me and laugh, and I admit I look unconventional so I said to myself that kids will be kids and tried my best to ignore it. They continued to whisper and laugh, not trying to hide it at all, and even when I would stare at back at them, they persisted. I probably made eye contact with both of them more than 5 times. 

I got the idea of talking to their parents afterwards to confirm that those kids were laughing at me because I was not gonna let myself get disrespected, especially by children. However, I should have known that their parents would act immature like their kids.

Church had ended and they were walking away. It happened so fast, but as soon as I said to the parents that their kids were looking and laughing at me and that I wanted to know what was so funny, they got defensive and didn't want to listen. After that I dropped it, but I did not anticipate my dad jumping in and trying to reason with them. Still, they were not listening and explained that their kids go to CCD (religious school) and would never do that. Now, we are outside the building and both my dad and the kids' dad start to yell at each other. This is when I started to regret my actions. The kids' dad yells ""Go back to your country!"" (we are Asian) which is the cherry on top so I ended it by dragging my dad back to the car.

I am completely mortified by what had happened, and I feel like the AH for opening my mouth. AITA?",0
"Throwaway.

My girlfriend’s brother owns a small cafe and bakery. It's a relatively new place, but I recommend it to everyone who wants a place to go. Everything there is good quality and it’s very cute. It’s worth mentioning that my girlfriend and her brother are very close and my mum knows this.

This past weekend, my mum was in town and decided to visit the cafe with a few of her friends. In the middle of the afternoon while my girlfriend is at work, I get a very distressed, angry phone call from my mum, demanding to speak to my girlfriend. I’m very confused and I could tell that she was crying, so I tried to calm her down a little before I tried to piece together what happened.

Once she’s ready, she starts ranting about how terrible the cafe was. She claims that the staff treated her terribly and how my girlfriend’s brother embarrassed her in front of her friends. I ask her to elaborate, and she explains that she didn’t bring any money to pay because she thought it would be free because she is “a friend of the owner.” Because she didn’t have any money, she was forced to ask one of her friends to pay the bill. 

To be fair, I found this all a little funny and absurd so I laughed. Looking back on it, I probably shouldn’t have done this as this really, really aggravated her. She got mad, and proceeded to call my girlfriend a terrible person “who was never going to be apart of the family.” I got mad, telling my mum that it’s not my fault that she’s broke. After that, she hung up.

I thought it was fine, but then I found out that my mum left a pretty bad review on the cafe’s website, harassed the cafe, and left my girlfriend a string of badly written text messages. I feel bad, because I don’t want my girlfriend - or her brother to suffer because of my actions.

EDIT: I’ve apologised to my girlfriend and her brother for my mum’s behaviour. My girlfriend doesn’t blame me, but I still feel terrible.",0
"Sorry for the long post! But here's my problem: we asked my sister if we could move in with her, and to her absolute credit she said yes. Her partner has serious anxiety issues, he won't even go to the bathroom downstairs if she has guests over in the living room. So he absolutely could have said no, we don't want them here because of x y and z. So the fact that they agreed is wild and I am grateful 
... But my problems start. When we get there we'll paying an equal half split of the bills and will be living in the livingroom which isn't small but also definitely isn't big , and there's some rules that my sister has put in place. She's going to move all the furniture out of that room, except the sofa... Which is huge and takes up a large portion of the room itself, we aren't allowed to bring a bed base as there's no room, she's suggested we should put the mattress on the sofa and pack stuff under on of the corners that wouldn't be supported otherwise. We aren't allowed to get rid of the sofa as it's been in her partners life for ages, we also aren't allowed to move it to another room.
Today she messaged saying that she talked to her partners brother for us, and we can leave our car at his place while we live here... His place is the next county over. 
She explained that it's because the street is almost always packed with cars and that we can't inconvenience the people who live here. And I think that just threw me for a loop, the sofa thing already stresses me out because we've had to throw half our stuff away already so that we don't clutter her house up, so in essence I feel like I'm moving my partner out of an emotionally abusive situation with his mum, into a bad living situation where we won't be allowed to have access to our own car the entire time. I tried to explain this to my sister and she got super angry calling me a ""f**king creature"" and saying ""well, sure, park on the street if you're happy with inconveniencing the nabours then fine. But you can't park within three houses either side of our house and that's for certain"" and I get that we'll be new to the street and people have been living there years, and all of a sudden we're trying to fit a whole car there. But I just feel like even though we'll be paying half the bills, it feels like she wants us to pretend we don't exist. So far we have to throw half our stuff away, we've binned anything that could have been seen as sentimental because there's no room, we have to throw away our furniture that doesn't fit, we have to throw away our bed base as it won't fit with the sofa, and now she doesn't want us to have access to our car because it would be an inconvenience to the people already living on the street. 

Am I being an asshole about this? She didn't have to say yes to us, she could have told us to take a hike, her partners anxiety might skyrocket with this as well. And once we move away there's likely no moving back. So have I just messed us all over by insisting that we leave?",0
"So my aunt for some reason thinks she decides other  people's interests for them. She just gifts them a bunch of stuff from it, even if they like something  else. She's done it since I was a kid.  
Ex: my mom barely even drinks Coke but she has tons of Coke products. A clock, a shirt, a blanket,  a bear, some cups,  etc.. 

Lately she's been getting my 15 year old brother Minecraft stuff. Which he doesn't play.

I don't like star wars, never have. I tried watching a few of the movies and they didn't interest me. 

Since I was 11 or 12 (I'm 17 now)  my aunt gives me something star wars related for my birthday or Christmas.  I litterally have a shelf in my closet I put the stuff on because I won't wear it, and have no use for it but every so often she'll bring it up to my mom so it's nice to have just in case.  

We've told her countless times that we appreciate the thought but those aren't things we're interested in.  She just brushes it off and says ""those are popular""  or ""everyone likes star wars "".  I've  tried telling her not to buy me anything but she still does. 

Well, yesterday she came over for dinner and my mom said something about going shopping the next day.

Then my aunt started with ""well he has a bunch of shirts I've given him over the years that I never see him in so he definitely doesn't need shirts"". I just sorta sat there. 

Then she looked at me and said ""why don't you wear stuff I give you?"" 

I said ""because it's in my room"". 

She got up and barged into my room, uninvited.  Then said ""I don't see it"".  So I opened my closet. She said ""you have it hidden in your closet?""  I was like ""yea, I don't like star wars as I've told you a million times, so I stick it in my closet"". She said ""you might not like star wars but you should at least use it and appreciate the gift"".  I just stood there. She said ""either start using it or give it back and I'll give it to someone that's not ungrateful"". 

So I grabbed a box and put it in there and gave it to her. 

She said ""I can't believe you're being so inconsiderate and hurtful "". And left. 

My mom said she can't believe I would do that. She said I should have just put a shirt on or some of the stuff out on a shelf in my room and then put it back when my aunt left.

I'm just sick of my aunt acting like she can force us to like certain things.  She asked for it back so I gave it back.

"So I left my wallet in my best friend’s car over the weekend. Every time we set a time to meet she cancels, changes the time, or has an excuse as to why she can’t meet for me to get my wallet. I offered to go to her house..:but she’s “never” home. So I told her I’m just going to have my debit card, and the other cards I have in my car wallet canceled and/or reported as stolen. She flipped her shit and told me I’m a bitch and an asshole for doing that and that it shows how bad of a friend I am for not trusting her, and how I’m bullying her by treating her like a theft and criminal.

Hey all, I wasn’t expecting such an overwhelming response. The wallet has been returned, it was left with the security guard at the entrance gate where I live.  
But thank you to everyone who took time to respond and give advice and their opinions on this situation. It was greatly appreciated. 

In regards to the cards, and as to why I canceled them was because with my bank you get same day replacements. 

The friendship has been ended it was a mutual agreement. I should have been more mindful of her red flags, and I should have taken into account that she was never really a friend and was more so using me.",0
"I (34m) have a 16 year old nephew Luca. Luca is my sister Gwen's son. Gwen's relationship with Luca's dad ended when he was just a baby and his dad died soon after. Gwen was in a relationship after he died for two years but that ended when she wanted her partner to marry her and adopt Luca before he'd remember life without him. I remember my sister being distressed about Luca not having a dad and my parents and my other sister told her repeatedly that he needed a good mom who focuses on giving them a good life and she was enough. She didn't take it on board for at least another year and then she suddenly declared she was going to be single until he was an adult. That lasted all of a year when she met her husband Rich. Rich had his own two kids who were 12 and 10 at the time. Luca was 5 when they met. Gwen and Rich were dating for a year before they married and it was one of those dynamics where everyone could see it was not what they were presenting to the world but they didn't care. Rich's kids did not like that he remarried and they took an extra special dislike toward Luca because he was forced onto them.

It created a very painful dynamic for Luca. My family would step in and ask if Gwen was sure it was good for Luca. That Rich's kids didn't seem too fond of Luca or that Luca seemed to be left out by the older kids. She would say they are slowly warming up or that Rich was handling it.

Luca and I really bonded around this time. He would come to me and I would let him vent and give him a place to share his frustrations and fears. He mentioned countless times that Gwen or Rich would get his stepsiblings to bring him with them and they would walk away and leave him behind places like at the mall or the park. I would help him tell Gwen and she would blow it off as nothing to worry about since Luca was fine. I told Gwen that Luca was really struggling to find his place when she was telling him one thing and the kids were telling him another. She told me he would listen to her since she's his mom.

Last year Luca came to live with me after he asked and I had spoken to some people who could help. It wasn't easy but he's happier now. Through the legal fight for me to get custody, he was diagnosed with depression and it was revealed his experiences in the home contributed to it. It had also harmed his self esteem to an alarming degree, according to a court appointed therapist. A few days ago Gwen and I ended up in the same place and she told me I interfered in something that was not her business. I told her that Luca deserved a better mom than her and she needed to not talk to me when I was the one there for her son and not her. She burst into tears and left. She told our parents and other sister. Our parents said I was right but our other sister told me I should have walked away without saying that to her. Gwen even emailed me a whole letter saying why I was an asshole and how I had broken her heart.

"I’ve been with my wife for 8 years now. She has primary custody of her daughter, Santana (9). Santana sees her dad, Mark every other weekend and some holidays.

As I’ve been one of Santana’s primary caretakers for the past 7 years (since I moved in with her mom), I’ve taken care of her more than Mark has and we are quite close. My wife and I went onto have 2 children together, who are now 5 years and 18 months. I’ve been a stay at home dad since the 5 year old was born. As a result, I’m the one making lunches, driving kids to activities, etc. That includes for Santana. 

Mark has always felt insecure about my place in Santana’s life. I’ve always encouraged her relationship with her dad, while also been a place she can go to in order to vent about both her parents. I’ve never asked her to call me dad, but I’ve made it clear I love her the same as her siblings. And she’s also said she loves me and considers me her second dad.

Mark also mocks me for my SAHD role. My wife always shuts him down and I just ignore him. He has in the past jokingly called me Santana’s nanny and I just roll my eyes and say “whatever you think, Mark”. I really don’t see him much as my wife will take Santana to her dad’s and pick her up. 

However, yesterday, my wife was sick and asked me to pick up Santana. She really couldn’t get out of bed and I knew Mark wasn’t going to drive out to us (he’s refused in the past). So, I went over to his place to pick her up. 

He was throwing a BBQ and had some family there. I had never met any of them. Santana ran into my arms, excited to see me and shouting my name. A few people looked at Mark curiously. He laughed and said “That’s Santana’s nanny”. I shook my head and said “I’m her step-father, Greg. Nice to meet you all.” Mark turned red and barely said goodbye to Santana. I didn’t think much of it outside Mark just being Mark.

However, Mark texted my wife later saying I “humiliated him” and given I’d likely never see those people again, I shouldn’t have said anything. My wife told him he’s overreacting and he then texted me, saying I had no right to correct him in his own home. He asked what was the big deal in his family thinking I’m her nanny?

"I have a habit of making my own meals to work, simply because I love cooking and health related issues.

So I just started a new job in a new company three months ago. And seeing me making my own lunch everyday has gotten me some attention from some colleagues, with that I was able to talk and mingle in a new environment. My colleagues tend to ask things like recipes, how long did I take to make it so and so; just small talk questions

Everyone was okay except for this one girl from the same department from me, which I will name her as Sally (27F), a junior designer. From the first day she saw my lunch, Sally has thrown in a lot of comments like how envious she is that I could cook my own meals etc. It was fine until after one week later, she started asking me questions like ""so when will you make me lunch?"" I was taken aback but I thought she was joking and waved it off with a smile and a nod.

After that, at least once a week, Sally would ask me the same question again and sometimes she'd even say things like, ""you still owe me a lunch made by you"" or she'll whine about me not wanting to cook for her. I've kindly turn her down everytime she brings up about this issue.

Last Monday, she offered to pay me if I make her lunch, for 3 dollars. I told her no again and she was visibly upset. She told me it's not that hard to make her lunch since I'm already cooking for myself every day, single and I am being unsociable and unfriendly by not making her food. 

Since then, she has been passive aggressive towards me. As well as not willing to cooperate at work when I hand her new tasks. It has made me feel bad about it and I have no idea how to go about this, should I have just made her lunch just to keep the peace? 

This feels horrible and I don't know how to deal with it :(

Edit: After reading all your comments, I think I will try to talk to Sally about this ad if that doesn't get through I'll have to discuss this matter with a same-ranking colleague or my supervisor 😔

"Hi! 
So I 32f have a sister 34f, we both have two kids. Mine are J 9f and M 7f, hers are H 9f and K 8m. 

We have had very different styles in parenting. I was never harsh on my kids nor did I mistreat them. I had rules, routines and taught them disrespect from a young age, but that don’t mean that I did not treat them with love. I have raised them to be the kids they are today and they are very well behaved, so great in school and have many friends, are polite and respectful. My sister had a completely different style when it came to parenting, she let them choose everything, it was always like they were in control of everything from the age they were around 2 years old. I never judged her for this, what worked for me and what I wanted to do was different from her choices, and that was fine by me.

However, she always judged me, she would often tell me that my kids would grow up to hate me because I was strict. I never really cared because my kids always seemed to be fine by this. 

The argument took place a couple of days ago while we were out for dinner with our parents to celebrate my mothers 70th birthday. While we were at the restaurant, her kids started demanding stuff, K threw a tantrum because the table next to us got their food before he got his. He was rude to the waitress and H told me “no one really cares, you know?” When I gave my mom a heartfelt speech about how much we all appreciated her and loved her. During the dinner, my kids behaved well, they were polite, had patience and well, behaved very good for being seated at a restaurant for that long. When we were leaving I told my kids that I appreciated them staying calm even though the food took a long time to come out (J has adhd and can often get a bit overwhelmed when she has not eaten). My sister heard this and told me that I did not need to brag about my kids in front of her to minimize her as a parent. I told her that I did not mean to do that and that I was sorry if she felt like I meant it in that way. She left and later texted me telling me that she was sorry, but that she gets overwhelmed with her kids and don’t understand why her kids behave the way that they do. I texted her back saying that she could maybe try a different parenting style with more rules and with her being more in control then her kids, that maybe they will behave differently after a while. She responded telling me that I always do this, that I have always seen myself as the better mother between us two and that if I don’t have anything nice to say about her or her kids and think that everything is her fault, then she will just stop talking to me altogether. I responded by telling her that I don’t think of her as a lesser parent.

She has not talked with me since this and I am starting to feel like an AH because every kid is different and just because something worked for me does not mean that her parenting style is wrong.

My husband is turning 30 next month. It's a big deal for him clearly and he wanted to rightfully be ""pampered"" and feel special on this ocassion.

But the thing is that he came up with a list and called it ""birthday month expectations"" I didn't know what that meant til he started reading the list out loud which consists of things he expects from throughout the entire month.

To give few examples:
A. He is not to be asked to do any type of chores or clean or cook for a month.

B. He gets to play with his xbox for hours on end without me interrupting or nagging him about it.

C. He is not to pay his part of rent this month.


D. He gets to go out with his friends whenever he wants.

C. He gets to skip any given workday and sleep in without being bothered to wake up to drive our son to school or do any emergency fixes.

In other words he wants a month long vacation and time off from his responsibilities as a partner and as a father. I said are you being serious right now and he made a face and said "" oh no worries this will only last for a month [""my birthday month""]. I called him ridiculous and said absolutely not I do not agree on anyhing on that list and said that his expectations for his birthday month was out of line. Now I have to mention that we both work but I do the majority of household chores and the majority of our son's care as well as the majority of rent, bills and internet payments and I can not afford to do what he's expecting me to do because we're struggling already and I need his help especially now. Not for him to make demands. He pitched a fit giving me grieve about how I'm being selfish towards his wants and that in my place he would've agreed to do all he could to make my ...[""Birthday Month""] the happiest month of the year for me. I argued that birthday month is unheard of and just flatout ridiculous but he said that I don't understand because his parents did this for him for years and so did his friends [he never told me] so as his wife I should be happy to do it as well but I declined and refused to take it and keep arguing about it but he hasn't stopped talking about how disappointed he was that I treat his birthday like that and has been avoiding being near me making me feel like maybe I went too far here.

"I (19f) lost my dad when I was 7. My mom was never super close to my paternal family but they were regulars in both of our lives because they stayed in mine after losing dad. Mom almost remarried 2 years ago but he bailed before the wedding, but not before they had two children together. His family wanted nothing to do with my half siblings and and my mom had a big argument with her parents 5 years ago and they no longer speak (the argument was over my uncle who mom went no contact with when she was 17). So when mom had two more kids and their dad bailed, she expected my paternal family to welcome them into the fold and adopt them as part of the family.

They did not. I never expected them to either but after moving out of my mom's, she has been pissed whenever I see them and celebrate something with them and my half siblings are not welcome. Right now there is a big issue over Christmas. I'm spending it with my paternal family. Mom is struggling for money and she wanted my half siblings to join my paternal family celebration. She asked my grandma and grandma told her it wasn't happening. Mom said they are family. Grandma said they were not her family. Mom then complained to me and called my paternal family heartless. I told her she had no right to be mad at them. She told me she had a right and if I was a better person I would be furious with them for excluding my siblings. I told her I am old enough to know that being my half siblings doesn't make them my paternal family's grandkids/niblings.

"I’m Asian, more specifically one of the only Chinese people in my grade, which has been absolutely fun these days. 

So the girl in question, has been racially harassing me since the beginning of lockdown, when she dmed and said “did the bat taste good? thanks a lot you fucking freak”. I reported her to my school, and they literally just dropped it because they said tensions were high, and she couldn’t be blamed because her uncle had corona, some BS like that. Then I got repeated messages like that from fake/newly created accounts, that I suspect were from her, and I just kept blocking them until I guess she gave up because I wasn’t reacting. 

My school district has chosen to do in person, massively dumb imo, but whatever. On the literal second day of school, she walks up to me while I’m in the lunch line and says in a thick asian accent, “Are you eating bat dumpring or dog noodle?” 

Other people around me fucking laughed, and I’m sure I don’t have to explain this, but I felt fucking humiliated. It finally felt like I got her off my back for a little while, and she comes back as soon as school starts, and I already know my school administration isn’t going to go to bat for me. 

I don’t know a lot about this girl, since obviously I try to avoid her, but I did know that she had shitty teeth, lived in a trailer, and was very poor. I’m ashamed to have stooped to this, but I just wanted to show her how I felt for once, so I said, “I’d be less concerned with what I’m eating if I were you, and more worried about your diet, since you’re the one who needs to figure out how to brush her teeth in a trailer with no running water. Stop trying to get sent to a hospital when you can’t afford healthcare.” 

Other students nearby told me I went too far because “it wasn’t her fault she was poor” LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT I WAS ASIAN?!?! She literally fucking cried, like I didn’t cry everytime she called me a fucking chink. She’s left me alone ever since though, which doesn’t matter since I plan on transferring anyways.",0
"My (19f) boyfriend (20m) has been slowly buying parts over the last 6 months to build me a gaming computer. Today was the day he finally put it all together. When I got home from school today he was so excited to show me and the feeling was mutual! He ended up going to the store for about a half hour and I decided to put my desk together, I grabbed an old tv we had in the basement, propped it up on my desk and set up my keyboard and mouse alongside a few decorations I had saved for this moment. 

When he got home I was super excited to show him my set up. He couldn’t give less of a shit about it. I was under the impression he was going to the gym with his friends tonight, but he canceled last minute. I was happy he was staying home, so we could play games together for the first time ever. Until he changed his mind again and decided he was going to go. My disappointment was obvious but it’s not that serious. He got frustrated with my disappointment and started to have an attitude with me. I told him it wasn’t a big deal and I didn’t mind he was going, I was just a little disappointed that I got excited to play games with him and he changed his mind. 

I asked him to help me plug it in before he went because I didn’t know which cables went where. He let out a big sigh and angrily started plugging everything in. He started to talk to me like I was annoying him and I asked him what was wrong and he snapped at me. Saying he can’t do anything and that he just wants to spend time with his friends after building me a computer all day. At no point did I try to make him stay home I was just a little disappointed he didn’t want to play games with me. I asked him not to speak to me like that because it makes me upset when I’m talked down to. It makes me feel worthless. 

He told me he was just stressed and insinuated I was ungrateful for the computer. I felt as though I had every right to tell him not to speak to me like that. Once again he tells me he just wants to hang out with his friends after spending all day doing something for me. I tell him, just go because he was about to make himself late arguing with me instead of leaving. Then, he stormed off. Could I have done something different or should I have just let him take his stress out on me since he spent hundreds of dollars buying me a computer? ",0

AITA for refusing to attend my sister's wedding due to a scheduling conflict? My sister, Emma, is getting married in a few weeks, and I've been excited to be part of her special day. However, here's where the dilemma begins.

I'm a medical student, and my final exams are scheduled to take place on the same day as her wedding. This wasn't my choice; it's a university-mandated exam date. I've been working tirelessly for years to get to this point, and failing these exams is not an option.

I explained the situation to Emma, and she was extremely upset. She accused me of not caring about her, being selfish, and prioritizing my education over her big day. She even said that I could ""find a way to make it work"" if I wanted to. Her and my parents are putting a lot of pressure on me to reschedule the exams or find a way to attend the wedding.

I feel caught between a rock and a hard place. I don't want to miss my sister's wedding, but I also can't jeopardize my entire medical career because of the scheduling conflict. AITA for choosing my exams over her wedding, or is she being unreasonable in her expectations?",0
"So there is a small park near my place that I take my dog to to play with his ball since we don’t have room in our apartment. Sometimes there is an older woman there with her two golden retrievers. One of her dogs *always* takes my dogs ball and refuses to give it up until the owner pries it out of the dog’s mouth. She has recently started asking me if when we’re at the park together if I could just hold the ball so her dog won’t take it. If you’ve ever had a dog that wants to play fetch you know that you can’t just hold the ball away…
I have been politely saying that my dog needs exercise/stimulation so I try and throw it in our little corner of the park but her dog will still always come and take it.
The last few encounters she has been making a big deal of “Oh I JUST got here but I’ll leave since this ball is an issue” and I feel bad that her dogs aren’t getting to enjoy the park time and maybe I should take my dog elsewhere to play so she can stay? 
Idk I just feel so bad that she gets annoyed but surely it’s on her to train her dog to not take other balls? ",0
"For a little backstory, I (24F) and my sister (26F) have never been crazy close, but we get on well. 

I found out I was pregnant with my daughter (unplanned) about a year after she announced she was engaged. At the time the invited were sent out, my daughter wasn’t born, but she would have been at the time of the wedding, so I called my sister and asked what the rules were in regard to children. She said it was child free. 

I made arrangements for someone to have the baby on the day of the wedding, and thought no more of it. 

For some additional context, I was extremely unwell my entire pregnancy, and almost died giving birth. Not once did my sister ask how we were, not even when the baby was born (not even a text to say congratulations). 

She was 4 months old by the time of the wedding and my sister had met her once and that was only because I went down to see her (I live 100 miles away). 

We get to the wedding and turns out it’s not child free. It’s not even baby free. This broke my heart, and I was so angry, so I just left the wedding and went and picked up my child and drove back home. 

2 weeks later my sister calls me and asks why my husband and I left, and when I told her, she kicked off saying it wasn’t personal my daughter wasn’t invited, the other babies were invited as they were her family. I just told her that her niece is also her family and hung up. 

Some of my family think I’m TA and should have just sucked it up for my sisters wedding but my friends are on my side.",0
"Pretty sure I know the answer, but I’m told my general approach and emotions around these kind of things is Not Normal due to a seriously messed up childhood and the type of work I do. So, crowdsourcing an opinion on my AHness from strangers.

I (28F) have had two miscarriages. The first one only I and my GYN know about because it happened almost as soon as I knew I was pregnant. It was actually a fortuitous thing, because it was not a good time career-wise, so it saved me some trouble. The second pregnancy was planned and it happened much further along and my husband and his family had a lot more time to get excited about it. They were devastated. I was not happy about it, but it was more of a “damn it, I have to start over” kind of thing than the “we lost a baby” perspective. After having the don’t count your chickens before they hatch lesson hammered home often, I just don’t think of fetuses as people or emotionally attach to them or the idea of a baby until it’s born, I guess. I was very annoyed by everyone spouting platitudes and trying to console me when I wasn’t even feeling particularly upset. I tried to be respectful of their grief, but at a certain point I asked not to be party to those discussions because it was done and I was moving on. My ILs and MIL especially were very upset that I wasn’t sad or grieving and some very inappropriate things were said.

Now, I’m pregnant again. My husband is over the moon, but agreed to hold off telling his family until we had passed certain milestones. We told them two weeks ago and they’re beyond excited. The problem is that I’m not. I’m doing my thing, getting my ducks in a row, and not investing a lot of emotional energy into the whole situation right now. I know they want to celebrate and document everything, but it’s getting on my nerves already. The last straw was when my MIL and SILs wanted to throw a baby shower, but to be honest we have everything we need from last time and it would just be a party for the sake of a party. I said I was fine and I didn’t want a lot of fuss like last time. MIL blew up and said that if I was going to be so cold about the miscarriage the least I could do was be happy and celebrate things going so well this time, and that I was ruining their and my husband’s excitement. I told them to have the party they want on their own time but I wouldn’t be there.

So, the ILs think I’m a giant AH and will be a terrible parent. My husband hasn’t gone that far, but he did say that it’s really weird that I’m so sanguine about the whole thing and wants me to just let them have the baby shower for me because they’re trying to be nice.",0
"I've been thinking about this but haven't done anything yet and wanted some outside opinions.

My Grandmother was the middle of 3 and inherited a Grandfather Clock from her mother, who was also a middle child, when her mother died. My Grandmother had seven children and my mother is the middle one. It was stated for decades that my mother would receive the clock when my Grandmother passed.

I am my mother's only daughter (of two children) so eventually it would've passed to me as well.

My Grandmother died in 2010 and at some point a couple of years before her death (from lung cancer so she knew this was coming) she got upset about not wanting people to fight over things and donated the clock to the church she frequented and was eventually buried at. When she died, no one fought over anything. We all got some of her paintings. One cousin got the piano, another got her dining set, some got letters from old relatives, etc. etc. There was no issue with anything for anyone as far as I'm aware.

We just had the funeral for my uncle at the same church this fall and they still have the clock. That thing was in our family for close to two hundred years before she did this and I'd like to buy it back, with a hefty ""donation"" to keep it that way.

I don't want to upset anyone but I'm afraid I will if there was a lot more to the story than I know and am honestly afraid to ask and have my heart broken.

So WIBTAH if I bought it back?",0
There is this little girl(10f) who has been coming over the last few days to play with my son (6m). Last night she stayed for dinner uninvited but whatever she was there. Well this morning after I had made my son and I breakfast she came over after we had long sense been finished eating to play. My son about 10 mins after she arrived came into my room and asked if we could make her breakfast because she didn’t have any. I told him if she’s hungry she can go home to eat. I didn’t say this to him but it’s not my responsibility and since I’m a single mom and it’s just me and him I just buy food for the 2 of us also groceries are expensive rn. AITA?,0
"My husband M32 and I F26 both work. We used to work together on chores and\ cooking. But recently he has been doing pretty much nothing. Note I'm pregnant and I feel sick all the time. Despite that I do all I can. He lost his pet (bird) 2 months ago and that's when he stopped doing anything in the apartment. I understand he's grieving but I started thinking he's using the line ""I'm grieving"" to skip chores. He works 3 days a week. I work long hours (nurse) and everytime I come home to take care of everything. I kept my mouth shut thinking he's depressed and in grieve but he goes out with friends. Laughs on SM. Plays boards games and watches Netflix nightly and is relaxed to the fullest.

Last night I came home at 9pm. He already had dinner and left dishes in the sink. I cleaned up. Ate dinner and went to bed. He was already asleep when I walked in. The conflict started when I saw that my side of bed was wet. I woke him up to ask him about the huge stain on my side of bed. He told me he spilled milk while he was watching YOUTUBE on my side of bed and forgot to clean it up. I was stunned. I yelled at him and asked him if he was serious when he said he'd clean it up tomorrow and told me to sleep on it. I started calling him inconsiderate and quite frankly a user since he keeps arguing that I'm cruel for not leaving him alone to grieve his beloved. I told him he didn't care that much about his pet since he's having fun and playing games. He looked at me shocked. Asked if I was done with my lecture then he couldn't believe I questioned his love for his pet. Then went outside.

We pretty much haven't talk since then. I slept on the mattress on the floor since the bed socked the milk stain. He took the sheets to clean them up and I felt guilty for what I said to him. He seems hurt and acts as if he is shocked by what I said. Amita here?",0
"My parents are both out of the country and they took the cars with them and my school doesn't have busses that come to my area since I live in a obviously rural area since we have a tractor, while my school is in the suburbs a bit far away. To deal with this, I jsut drove to school in a tractor. I didn't see how it would be a problem, it takes up no more space than a pick up truck and the parking lot is rarely more than halfway full other than on major school events.

I drove to school several days on the tractor and on the third day the principal comes out and says I need to go home with the tractor. I explaiend that I live 35 kilometers away and that is not an option. He says he doesn't care and I told him no, I'm going to get an education and I don't care what he says. I ignored him as he's screaming at me. He then called the police. Police came to my classroom and they made me come out. Later turns out there's nothing they can do as there's nothing in the school rules or the region's laws about driving tractors to school and its allowed on public roads.

Principal the next day says I need to stop, I told him to go fuck himself. He then tells me to go with him to the principal's office and I continue to tell him to go fuck himself. He calls my parents to discuss displinary actions, and jsut like last time he called them my parents said ""im at a work trip, I'm getting paid 400 euros an hour, I don't have time for this petty shit, unless you can pay me more than I don't want to fucking hear it"" and he hung up. In the end all they could do is give me detention for ""disrespecting authority"" which I didn't even show up to becuase those dumbasses forgot to put me in the system on the detention list online.

Fuck my school and fuck my principal.",0
"Long story short I can't carry to term. Any time I was pregnant resulted in a miscarriage/sudden loss, and one time it was at 24 weeks. I'm okay with this. I'm not as maternal as I thought I would be, and am happy to be childfree, even if it was not by choice. I understand these are the cards I was dealt.

As such I keep mainly to myself. When we were working outside of home, three woman in my office became pregnant. I was more than happy to celebrate with them, etc well into their late terms, and celebrate when they had their kids too with gifts. 

During these times we'd talk about pregnancy cravings, etc. Id talk about mine, and we'd laugh about it. Only one person in the office knew about my situation. Now thatbwe work from home we communicate basically through text, another is pregnant. And we started talking about it all again. 

The one person who knows my situation in my office messaged me privately telling me to stop talking about when I was pregnant,  because I'm not a mother and since I won't be I shouldn't contribute. Not gonna lie, truth kinda hurt but I understood why she said that. However now I feel like the AH for ever talking about it, and maybe she's right.",0
"Hi everyone, my (36M) brother (40M) and his wife have been struggling with purchasing a home for some time. They have previously rented. My brother asked me back last summer if they could live with me and my wife in our new house we purchased in Fall 2021. My wife and I are well off, both have high paying jobs, no kids, and our house is bigger than we need. I told my brother that it should be fine and asked how long they need to stay. He said until the end of the year which should give him enough time to save up some money and pay off some credit card bills and look for a house. Agreed upon time was from August until December.

At first, everything was great. I love my brother and his wife and I enjoy spending time with them. Over time, though, I noticed that the timeline wasn't adding up. They moved in a bunch of stuff, took over our pantry, and stored stuff in areas I told them I didn't want it. It didn't appear they were making much effort looking for a home either and when I asked him about it, he said mortgage interest rates are too high. He bought a good bit of stuff too like a 3090Ti graphics card, expensive collectibles, etc. I'm not judging him on what he spends his money on but the whole point of this was for him to save money. I'm not charging him anything at all to live here and I even paid for their meals a few times.

In November I asked him what his plans were. I told him it takes a long time to close on a house and this would go past the December date we agreed upon. He said he now needed to stay until the summer. Once I heard this, I realized that once summer gets here, the date may get pushed again for as long as I allow. I work from home so having someone here most of the time where previously there wasn't has been a change for me. As much as I appreciate spending time with them, I was ready to have my privacy and quietness back.

One night we let them know that we'd be happy to extend the deadline to the end of February but summer will be too long. He seemed to take it okay at the time but things have gotten weird. I understand that he's hurt and feels like his brother is kicking him out because essentially, I am. In the past few weeks, they have been mostly standoffish. They will talk to us some nights and on others they lock themselves up in their room. They decided that they aren't staying until February and have already packed up most of their stuff and moved it out. They do have arrangements to stay with their parents until summer. Today, their food was given away to one of their coworkers instead of being offered to us. We haven't received any thanks or anything and now I feel like we're going to be portrayed as the bad guys to our families for kicking them out. I did this to help them but it seems it has backfired. My mom has already guilted me by saying ""This is your brother, are you sure you can't let him stay longer?"".

"I live in a semi detached home

Got new neighbours January 2024. There was a lot of banging and thudding when they moved in.

2 weeks go by and everyday from 9pm neighbour appears to finish work at this time comes home and slams the front door, back door, wardrobe doors etc they echo through my home, they thud bang upstairs from 9pm and up till 2-3am it’s at random times it’s erratic. I can hear the noises in my living room and bedroom, so loud at times I hear it in my kitchen the furthest point away from them.

I decided to write a diary and see if a pattern appears, at end of January I have a log of it happening 2100-0300 daily.

I was so stressed now that I knew I had to inform my neighbour but I struggle to approach people so I asked my landlord to come with me and help explain that the noises of thudding banging after 11pm is too much…

My landlord agreed and we spoke to my neighbour and they accepted the noises but my landlord mentioned otherwise we will have to take legal action if it carries on. The neighbour said it was their dog making a noise as it’s a puppy.

Next day neighbour stopped me and said sorry for the noises but we got hard wood laminate upstairs and don’t want you to notify our landlord as we had complaints of noise from our previous address, I said okay it’s just maybe our internal wall is single brick? he said water under the bridge and maybe we be friends, I said I would like that.

A week went by and the noises tamed, but then they retuned more excessive and louder, but now their dog would bark 10mins long on and off till midnight and beyond to a point I started recording a diary again and recording video of it happening on my phone.

it appears his female partner who would come home 9pm and bang, slam, thud till 2am as it would only happen when she was in attendance.

Went on for 2 more weeks and then it got extreme, 2am they was STOMPING so loud it was frightening to hear that I just implusely shouted out loud back STOP! EVERYDAY YOU BANG SO LATE! WHY! .. it went silent for 30mins then suddenly I was greeted by two LOUD RAPID STAMPING shaking the walls, I didn’t react as I was just so flustered why? I didn’t sleep till 4am as I was so stressed then 7am I was woken by the same loud STOMPING and STAMPING behind my bedroom wall.

I didn’t react I just got up, got in my car and saw my landlord. They said put a formal complaint to their landlord with descriptions of their actions and times and report it to your council. 

So that’s what I did I made a formal complaint to their landlord and reported it to my council.

But soon I sent the letter and reported it to council I felt bad, but I feel I already expressed my concerns verbally and if I don’t complain this will just happen indefinitely. 

Side note they just let their dog mess in the garden, there must be x25 piles… and counting

AITA for reporting them for noise nuisance? I am from the UK England",0
"A few months ago, my (F32) brother Mario (29) got married to a lovely lady, Kate (29). Kate and her family are nice people, but they’re extremely formal, and can be a bit cold. My family, on the other hand, is extremely casual. We love to joke around and poke fun. I think if Kate’s family were to describe my family, there would be comments about propriety and lack thereof.

The day after the wedding, Kate’s parents hosted brunch at their house. When I arrived, I walked into the living room. Sitting there was Kate’s dad, her grandma, and my other brother. On the coffee table, there was a large serving platter. On the serving platter, there was a dip that had been prepared in a mold. You don’t see a lot of dip molds these days, so [here’s a visual](https://www.createdby-diane.com/2010/07/how-to-make-dip-more-appetizing.html) to give you an idea of what I’m talking about. This dip was a little different. It was about a foot long, in the unmistakable shape of a penis and testicles.

When I saw it, I thought I had misjudged my brother’s new in-laws. Food in the shape of dick and balls? What could be funnier than that? They had clearly been hiding their great sense of humour all this time. As soon as I saw the dip I burst out laughing.

“Something left over from the bachelorette party?” I said.

My brother’s father-in-law looked me dead in the eyes.

“It’s a lobster,” he said.

As other guests arrived, it became clear who was in my family and who was in Kate’s family. My family were all making thinly veiled penis jokes, while Kate and her family ignored us and pretended there wasn’t a giant dick on the table.

“So creamy,” my cousin said as she dug into the shaft with a cracker.

“They should have put some sprouts around the base,” my aunt said.

For months, I’ve been telling people the dick dip story, and anyone with a sense of humour thinks it’s hilarious. Last weekend, I had some people over to my house, and as a joke, I decided to make my own dick dip. Out of respect for my sister-in-law, who lives in a different city, I did not post any photos of the dick dip to social media. Some of my friends, however, couldn’t help themselves. Kate saw photos of the dick dip on a mutual friend’s Instagram story, and now she is upset.

I haven’t heard from her, but my brother called me and said I’m disrespecting her and her family. He says I need to apologize. In my opinion, I didn’t do anything wrong and Kate should lighten up. It’s a dip in the shape of a penis. Relax.

AITA for making a dick dip?",0
"I've been living with my roommate for about a year now. He's a nice fellow and we get along just fine. His girlfriend is often around and is also a very nice person. We never really had problems so far.

I don't generally stay at home for long periods of time, it's essentially just a sleep/eat place. I work a lot of hours and a lot of overtime. It's the nature of my job, since I'm still new on my work place and all that.

Usually, I get home around ten or eleven in the evening and leave my home at eight. So yes, I work a lot and don't really spend a lot of time there. Yesterday, I managed to receive some good graces with my boss and he told me I could go home early (Around six, and yes, I know it's not really early, but for me it is.)

I got home and I was already craving some unhealthy food and my bed. It was Friday, so yeah, I was looking forward to it. My apartment isn't that big and our door opens up to the living room. 

Once I pushed it open I unwillingly saw my roommate and his girlfriend having sex. In our living room, in OUR couch. They were startled and I immediately closed the door in front of me, and said through the door ""Go to your room"".

After some sounds I hear his door close up. I opened the door and that was it. I mean, it's embarrassing to walk in on someone, but that can happen, it is not the end of the world. 

I went to the bathroom, had a shower and went to my room to watch some Netflix, and thought that was it. After a few hours my roommate took his GF home and came to talk to me. Initially, I thought he would apologize for being... less than careful.

However that wasn't the case. This dude started to get mad at me for not ""Letting them know I would be home early"". He said that his GF was completely ashamed and I should APOLOGIZE to her.

Now, I'm usually a very calm person. But this dude, is right here telling me to apologize for getting in MY HOME early. While he has a PERFECTLY good bedroom. The apartment has a very good sound isolation due to how it was constructed, so if they wanted to go wild there I would be none the wiser.

They actively decided to do it in a place where exposition was possible. So I told him flat out. ""Nah man. You're the idiot who tried to do something stupid while sharing an apartment. You didn't tell-me you were planning on doing that. I had no way of knowing. I'm sorry your girlfriend is ashamed, but I'm not apologizing.""

Things escalated from that point. There was a lot of angry remarks and things said. He started to call me and asshole for not being considerate.

Now, if he hadn't been such a stupid person, I wouldn't mind apologizing to his GF. I understand it's a embarrassing situation and I don't particularly have anything against her. But he got on my nerves good.

So, I want to ask, AITA for simply not trying to take the blame for something I had absolutely no fault on?",0
"Hi, I (19f) and my bf (19m) lived together for a while now and I’ve never been happier. A little context he and I are gamers. Like hardcore gamers. We play nearly every day.

"I 25F, my ex 25F got into an arguement about me going out with a friend the day her uncle (who she was not very close with but her dad was). Some background my ex and I dated for 2.5 years and have been broken up for 5 months. We decided to remain friends. My friend 26M and I dated back in high school and have remained friends. My ex's uncle passed on the same day I was suppose to go out with my friend for his bday with some other friends. She works rurally for work and was out of town when she told me the news and said she was coming back here in a couple of hours.

Now here's the AITA part, I told her I had plans to go out tonight. But if she was coming back then I would only go to the first activity for a few hours and be done around the same time she returns. She got super upset I was going out with my friend because she thinks theres something going on between us or that we like each other (there isnt, he has a gf and a child and im not interested). She said some nasty things to me that I'm desperate for male attention to be ""wanting so badly"" to go out with my friend group who are all male and that I want to still be friends with an old ex. Among some other things she said, she also said we're done being friends if I go out even for the first activity, because I'm not prioritizing her and am instead prioritizing a guy. Despite me saying I would make sure I'm available when she arrives. It upset me and I told she needs to stop trying to control me and who I hang out with and it's none of her business to be saying things like that to me. (The control part stems from some previous incidents we had). 

I don't feel like I am being an asshole for choosing to still go out for awhile, but I feel like maybe I shouldn't have said anything to her because I was upset. AITA?

My wife 23f wants to live in Florida not because of the interest but solely because her parents .

My wife currently in the navy but getting out late next month. We have built a life together cars, house, 2dogs, rarely do we ever fight, disagree sure we are humans after all but never name calling or anything of the sort. 

We have been planing to move back to Japan. I was all for Japan because I knew it would be safe for her and our future kid. After discussing it she was against it because she didn’t want to live in a different country from family. I obliged and realized she’s got a point and was okay with that. 

Next I wanted to move to Texas, again we can afford a nice house, a safe area and we can still live our normal lifestyle. She stated that she hates Texas after her time living there. As much as I wanted to move to Texas I understood her point and said okay that’s fine no worries.

Her parents decided on a whim that they want to move to kissami FL. I have no problem with her parents moving they are adults, allowed to make their own decisions. Now that her parents are moving to Florida she wants us to follow. Also we found out that she is pregnant with our first kid. 

I realized the area that her family is moving to is not somewhere I want to raise our kid. I don’t think it’s a good area and it won’t be safe for our kid or her (my concern). 

I expressed to her about what I think and that it’s not a good idea to move there. So my wife’s mom (call her Jill) is telling her that she needs to move with the parents, and that if I loved her I would follow her.

I expressed that I’m not taking away her family and we can always come visit and see them and vice versa, but Jill is telling her that if she moves to PA then she’s never going to be happy and always depressed. Basically filling her head up with lies. Yet she claims that what ever she wants she’ll support it.

After sitting down and talked about our future together or separate, I still want to be in the kids life and heavily involved. But at the end of 4 days my wife said that she’ll trust me and move with me. 

She proceeds to tell Jill that she wants to stay together and continue building our family. Jill proceeded to call her names and claim that have fun being manipulated and depressed. I can’t believe you’ll stoop that low. Naturally my wife got upset, and was like I’m going to lose my parents. 

Then tonight she told her that if she lives in PA she Is going to be white trash. Then proceeds to ask me why PA, and I told her because I was injured in the marines. PA we don’t have to pay property taxes which is huge. Then Jill tells my wife if she moves to NJ they will stay instead of moving to Florida. 

So AITA for not wanting to live in Florida to be close to her parents, and am I responsible for causing this argument and almost divorce? Please be honest I do truly want what’s best for my kid and her, but more importantly the kid.  ",0
"For context I 18(F) was best friends with we will call her E 18(F) for a year before this incident. E was dating a guy I will call him J 36. We were both seniors at the time. Nobody thought she should be dating him but she didn’t listen. She did the devils tango with this guy the first time she meet him. I didn’t know at the time. We were at school and she told me a few weeks later so she took a pregnancy test because there was no precautions used. It ended up being negative. E decided to draw a line on it and make it look like it said pregnant right in front of me mind you. She started telling everyone she was pregnant. The councilor eventually got told and made her tell her mom. At this point we were not friends after E faked her pregnancy test but, I didn’t feel it was my business to tell anyone because they would eventually find out. E then started telling everyone she had a miscarriage and had some gross picture of the miscarriage about a month after she was telling everyone she was pregnant. She started telling people I called her a whore and other things because she was pregnant and that’s why we weren’t friends. So I told everyone including J about the whole thing and faked the pregnancy test right in front of me. So AITA for telling people E faked her miscarriage.


Edit: I forgot to include while we were in the bathroom when she took the pregnancy test E told me she lied to J and told him she was on birth control. That is why J didn’t use a condom. ",0
"Throwaway Account

Okay this is a bit messy but please stick with me.

I (26f) have am my mom's (54f) child and only daughter to my dad who she met after breaking up with my uncle ""Bob"" (53m) who had cheated on her with my aunt ""Jane"" (51f) and was pressured into marriage by their parents finding out Jane was pregnant with my cousin ""Amelia"" (32f). I'm not sure about all the details but from what I've gathered Bob started sleeping with Jane because she was willing while my mom wanted to wait until marriage. My grandparents were very religious and traditionalists.

My mom was devastated and cut Bob and Amelia out of her life for years and went LC with my grandparents after they retried pushing for reconciliation after Amelia was born. Eventually, my mom met my dad and got engaged and I guess by that point she was truly over Bob because she invited him, Jane, Amelia, and their son ""Bob Jr"" (28m) to the wedding. Jane was bummed out that she couldn't be a bridesmaid or that my mom made my god sister her flower girl instead of Amelia and there was an argument. Before the wedding there was a sit down between my parents, Bob, Jane, and my maternal grandparents where my mom said that she was willing to have some type of relationship with all of them but only under the condition that they all agreed to never speak about the past again.

From that day on me and my cousins all grew up together and never knew the truth and I thought we were all one big happy family. So I was surprised my mom wasn't as sympathetic as I thought she should be when it turned out that Bob had been cheating on my aunt multiple times with different women. They later divorced after Bob had gotten one of flings pregnant.

Bob moved away and barely saw my cousins but he always sent me cards, presents, and messages. I also didn't find out until later but he actually paid for my college in secret so I didn't have any debt while Amelia and Bob only got partial help from him.

Recently my uncle Bob passed away and his lawyer requested that I attend the will reading and I went to more so support my cousins. I was floored when I realized that I got almost everything. That's when the secret came out and it was revealed that Bob never got over my mom, was still in love with her, and always as me as the daughter that should've been his.

It took me getting a DNA test to prove that I was my father's daughter to convince everyone that my mom never slept with Bob, and during that time my cousins and Bob's other children said some really nasty things to me. After some time had cooled off I looked at the total value of my share of around $400,000 (after fees) and agreed to just give 50% to my cousins. They weren't happy and felt that as Bob's legal children they should get EVERYTHING, wouldn't hear about accepting any less, and called me a greedy witch with a b. AITA?

Edit: Just to be clear neither my mom, dad, or I knew that Bob was the one who gave me money for college because when I was applying for stuff Bob sent me a link to an organization that a ""friend"" of his knew about that gave money for school. The place seemed legit and asked me to show my college acceptance letter along with a 300-500 word Personal Statement and a copy of my transcripts, and that I'd find out in about two weeks if I got it. After he got the stuff I sent Bob googled the average of the school I was going to go to and mailed me a check for that amount. The check was sent to a P.O. Box that I had and that's how Bob would send me the money every year.  


Edit 2: Also Bob did leave his children something. 

Amelia got $20k

Bob Jr. got $10k plus a car

Bob's other son $10k plus his other car

Bob's other daughter got ownership of his small beach house (she's the only one who lives in the same state as it)",0
"My parents got divorced in 2018 and are both remarried now, my dad's wife is pretty chill, she's really young and we get along well. She can't have kids, she and my dad travel, she's super cool, and I like her. My mom's husband is sort of strict and he's really into his kid. He's supposedly mildly autistic (he knows better than to do what he's doing, he's 17 and he goes to an Ivy for university) and he's the main reason why I'm moving out of my mom's. 

My mom's husband's son has made me into what I guess I would call his special person. He's constantly following me, he doesn't give me any privacy, he has absolute meltdowns when I try to leave the house or go out with my friends, he slams on the door and screams when I'm in the bathroom or when I lock my door, my stepdad took down my door because I locked it to get away from his son and my mom was silent and didn't defend me because I've realized that I'm only living with her because I take the heat off of her and I'm suffering because she doesn't want to deal with him. 

This isn't the way I want to live my life, I feel like a prisoner and I constantly walking on eggshells, I didn't sign up for this and I'm not interested in being the primary caretaker of some man's nearly adult child who he won't take care of or discipline, his son manipulates people into giving in because they don't want to argue or fight, and he pretends to not understand but he's going advanced psychology classes at an Ivy League, he has to know what he's doing and how he's making me feel because I've looked in books and read them and I'm autistic and I've explained in ways that make sense to me but he doesn't care about what he's done to me.

Anyway, a few days before Christmas, I told my mom that I wouldn't be coming back to her place in the new year and she got heated and yelled at me and told me that I didn't have a choice, she turned on the waterworks and my stepdad called me a selfish bitch, and she had a complete meltdown where he had to get her water and she was crying. I simply told her that I turn 18 on 1/2/2021 and that if she wants to go to court, I'll see her there. She's been texting me now and blowing up my phone asking me to come back but I just send her that Chris Evans ""no, I don't think I will"" meme and I feel like an avoidant piece of shit.

"I 47(M) married to a 46(W), and we have two kids, ages 11 and 14. Both my wife and I work full-time jobs with limited vacation time. Over the years, we've joined my wife's family on several extensive vacations. Her parents are retired and enjoy organizing big trips. My side of the family mostly enjoys in town get togethers.  While I generally can get along with anyone and keep the peace, on these trips I go with the flow, but ultimately do not really relax. 

I find myself increasingly weary of spending all my vacation time navigating complex family dynamics. So, when a big trip to Europe with her family was proposed for this year, I expressed to my wife that I'd prefer not to spend my vacation that way. I did not say that she could not go, I just did not want to spend my vacation time this year that way. She was disappointed but understood and informed her family we wouldn't be joining.  
  
A few months later, the situation shifted. My niece wants to celebrate her sweet 16 with a cruise, and our kids are very close with their cousin. Knowing how much this celebration means to everyone on my side of the family, I felt it was important for the kids not to miss out. My wife, who gets seasick and dislikes cruises, was understandably reluctant. I suggested that I could go with the kids, allowing them to be part of their cousin's special day, even though I'd personally be happy to skip the trip if it weren't for wanting to support my niece and not disappoint our kids.  
  
Now, my wife's reaction has been mixed. She's shown understanding by agreeing I should take the kids on the cruise, but she's also been displaying passive-aggressive behavior and lamenting being left out. Moreover, she's has been making passive comments about the decision to not join her family in Europe, framing it as a double standard. It's important to note here that while we've participated in numerous elaborate vacations with her family, we've rarely done anything comparable with mine, usually opting for shorter, more local gatherings.  
  
AITA for deciding to go on the cruise with our kids, leaving my wife behind due to her aversion to cruises, especially considering the imbalance in how we've historically allocated our vacation time between our families?",0
"Like many people who are preparing for their wedding, my fiance and I are trying to nail down a menu with our caterer. Our wedding is coming this summer, and we are at the point where we need to make decisions about our menu. Our caterer allows us two entree choices for the wedding menu- we definitely want one meat option and one vegetarian option because we have many guests who are vegetarians. 

The problem, though, is one of our invited guests, Luke, will be bringing his girlfriend, Lisa, as his plus one. I do not know Lisa very well- we've only met about three times. In our limited interaction, she has made it very clear that she's a glutenfreegan (a gluten free vegan). The hangouts we have attended are memorable because she always brings baked goods, serves them to everyone, and then as soon as we finish eating them she smugly goes ""HA! That was gluten free, dairy free, and vegan! See? It's not so hard"".

Back to wedding planning, the menu we were ready to submit to our caterers included a cherry duck breast with leek mashed potatoes for the meat option , and a mushroom cream sauce pasta entree as the vegetarian meal. Luke texted us asking if we know what we will be serving, so we told him what the projected options are. He told us Lisa will be mad because the vegetarian option still includes lactose (cream sauce) and gluten (pasta). He gave her my phone number and she started- unsolicited- texting me alternatives that I should change my wedding menu to.

I sympathize with Lisa, it is hard to have dietary restrictions. But changing an entire menu just for her doesn't work. The only vegetarian options we were given by the caterer all include pasta, and I am having a hard time finding ANYTHING that would fit for her special dietary restrictions but still serve the needs of other guests. WIBTA if I didn't change my wedding menu just for her?",0
"

Long story short, my BFF (34yo) is divorcing not amicable and is suppose to move out along with her two kids (boy age 6 and a baby girl age 2). Although her ex it fairly well off and She is used comfort but is ready to be free at all costs. We live in Europe so she will only have minimal support financially.

As She was desperate to find a siutable place, my husband and i had a flat rented out,which was going to vacay, so I offered it to her. She's seen it 6 years ago. It has a morgage so she will only have to pay this, which is half the ammont for a similar flat.

The condition for the rent to be minimal,was we'll only make slight adjustments when the tenants that inhibit it leave.Sadly, those people left the flat in an awful state, so we ended up exceeding the budget for it 3 times. We used extra effort to renovate it as fast as we could, so she can move out quickly and we dont lose a full month of rent. She saw it a week ago and was ensusiastic and even got the key, so she can start do some cleaning, purchase a bunk bed for her kids,ect. It is livable, although it is not new, but it still can be rented out for around 50% more than the morgage. She will need to deep clean it herself, including some nasty stuff in the bathroom, deal with bad tiling, buy the desired bed for her kids on her own.. We will need no pre payments from her side, nor she will start to pay rent till the end of this week. We don't know if she will stay for six weeks or for an year, and neither does she.

Yesterday I got a call from her, complaining about the general condition of the property. She complained a lot, and wants us to pay for a professional cleaning, to change the rusty mirror in the bathroom, to change some of the appliances in it. I agreed they are not new, and that I can arrange some additional budget for a cleaning help in the next week, but this is it. She argued that nobody will be OK with this flat as it is, that even if I rent it to a stranger it must be ready to move in, that now she is grossed out by some parts of it(like the distance between the tiles). I try to be understanding, but felt really crushed, because she told me she is the one doing the favor to me by renting it now as it is, and having to accept those things. It felt like she was making a mistake, like she struggles with all the work she is doing, so I explained to her that it is not too late to drop it and find a different place to rent. But for this price that is what I can offer. My husband is saying that I put my friend above our family, because we legit can actually profit from the flat to at least cover some of the expenses we have done. We feel like we are the ones doing her the favor, and he doesn't want to pay a dime more for that flat. So, reddit, AITA for knowing the place do need work done, but not willing to do it because these are the conditions and she can take them or leave?",0
"So, I(M14) have a crush on a girl(F14) in my class. She gave me a gift recently and I thought I would make something for her. So, I stitched a bunny(for the first time, since I've never stitched before) and packed it up in a gift box. My mom now demands that I give it to her since she wants my first stitched toy. I explain to her that I had already made it for someone else and can't give it to her, but would be more than happy to make another one. Moreover, the first one looks horrible so she wouldn't enjoy it. But she insisted. I held my ground and didn't give it to her. It was the last day of school and I would only see my crush after the holidays. I gifted my crush the toy today and she loved it. AITA for refusing to give my mom the toy?

Edit 2: please everyone I don't want to paint a bad picture of my mother. This is just so that I can feel that I didn't do her wrong. She did help with it a tiny bit, and she can be amazing at times. It's just some times she fights about small things. I love my mother, I just wanted to know of what i did was morally wrong.

I'm not trying to say you can't give your opinion, just holding my mother's honor. I should have mentioned a few stories of her being amazing too, but I didn't. My fault.

Edit 4: removed edit 3
Moreover, my mother and sister have ganged up on me and are fighting me. My grandma is standing up for me, but I feel genuinely horrible. My mom asked for one person from anywhere in the world to tell her I am right, little does she know there are now over 50. Thank you Reddit, you've made me have hope during a harsh time in my life.

Edit 5(this is getting a bit excessive, sorry): there are now over 100 people. Oh my god, thank you so much for all of this help. I appreciate everyone's perspective!

One last edit: due to my mom spying on me, I can't respond to any more comments lest she sees this. If I have something important to adress, then I will adress it. So sorry!

Edit of end: I guess this is it then. Yesterday night(its a new day for me now) my sister tried to convince me that I should have had my priorities set straight and give more priority to family than friends. I said that perhaps I have friends set on a higher priority, and don't want to change that. She ended up crying, saying that loyalty is a two way street, and my mother has given up everything for me, and I should be ready to do the same. I feel horrible.",0
"Back story: I'm a 29M and I've been in EMS for almost 7 years, but I've only been a paramedic on a department for about a year. Now onto the story.

This happened a few shifts ago. We got a call at 0600 for a pediatric full arrest. When we got on scene, my heart dropped. The parents said that they put their 6mo to bed last night and then went to bed. When dad was about to leave for work, he opened the door to see his baby before leaving and noticed that the baby wasn't breathing.

I stood there for a minute thinking about how I was going to tell these new parents the bad news. The baby was cold to the touch, pale, and lividity had set in... their baby died in the middle of the night. I tried to convey my sympathy to them and told them that it wasn't their fault and tragedies like this happen. The parents were understandably inconsolable. 

The rest of the shift was silent. When I got home, I kept running that conversation with the parents in my head over and over again.I called up my friend and asked him if I could come over to talk.

I went to his apartment and we talked for hours about it. I was just an emotional wreck because this was my first infant death. He tried to get me through this as best he could, but then his fiancé came home from work. She came in the front door and instantly started complaining that she had the ""worst day ever"" because a customer gave her attitude.

When she walked into the living room and saw me, she said ""I had a bad day and I don't want people over so you need to leave right now."" When my friend said that something terrible happened to me at work she looked at him and said ""All he does is sit around, watch TV, and play Xbox. How terrible can it be?"" My friend and I were stunned. She kept going on and on about how I basically do 10 minutes of work on my 24hr shifts and she works so much harder than me. I was already in a bad place emotionally and hearing her say all those things just made my blood boil.

I finally looked her in the eyes, and said ""You don't know what a bad day even looks like! You were mildly annoyed for 5 minutes and that's it. I had to look 2 new parents in the eyes and tell them that their baby died last night while they were sleeping! Just the THOUGHT of knowing they called us to save their baby and I was powerless to do anything kills me inside, but I know that, no matter how bad I feel, they are feeling much much worse. Now tell me, do YOU still think you're having a bad day?"" And then I stormed out.

My friend called me a few days later to check up on me. I was doing better by then and had more time to process everything. He went on to say that he had a long talk with his fiancé about what happened and said that what I told her really messed with her. She has been crying on and off since I left. I feel like I may be the AH because I lashed out at her in rage and I could have handled that better. So AITA?",0
"I payed college tuition for all three of my kids(27f, 29f, 32m) because I have the money and I wanted to. My older two studied Computer Science while my youngest one decided to study Fashion Design. I wasn’t really supportive about the Fashion Design degree at first and tried to warn my daughter that the job prospects for it wouldn’t be that great but she was insistent that, that was what she wanted to study so I paid approx. 60k for her to get her degree. However, afterwards she struggled finding a job in her field and the one’s she did find didn’t pay well so she came back to me and asked me to help her get another degree. I told her I could help her take out a loan but I wasn’t paying and it caused a lot of problems between us and she went no contact. She ended up going to community college part time while working as a server with the help of her boyfriend.

I helped my older two pay for their weddings and my youngest daughter recently got engaged. She started talking to me and her mom again and we were excited about the wedding. However, she started planning for things way out of her budget that her older sister/brother were able to have at their weddings. Her mom and I were worried that this wedding would not be good for her financially and decided to talk to her about it. My younger daughter told us she thought we would pay for most of it and was planning on having a high end wedding close to what my elder two had. My wife and I told her we were not going to drop 30k to pay for her wedding after she went years of no contact with us. Furthermore, my elder two paid for most of their own wedding, we just pitched in about 5k for each of them. They both make good money, well into the six-figure range. My younger one got super angry with us and complained how it wasn’t fair that her siblings got better things than she did and said we were playing favorites. AITA for not paying for her wedding?",0
"I inherited a house a few years ago after the passing of my grandfather. The timing was perfect as I had just graduated and it wasn’t that far from the area where I wanted to work.

About 2-3 years ago a development company bought a bunch of surrounding property to build a semi-gated community. The fence for the community ends a good few yards away from my property but isn’t closed all the way.

Now that people have moved in I’ve been getting HOA letters about fees, my lawn, and my house paint. I tried emailing the HOA president but they never got back to me.

I crashed the last meeting they had and explained that my house wasn’t part of the neighborhood and therefore not part of the HOA. The president and board members tried to say that I was because of how close my property is.

It isn’t, and I have documentation from the development company and the county saying it isn’t. After the meeting the president emailed back and said that regardless of the particulars I should still try to conform to the rest of the community because I was bringing property values down.

I know that I was very lucky in getting my home and I don’t want to negatively affect others, especially considering the current market.

AITA for not listening to the HOA?",0
"So my husband (M30, Dan, fake name) is part of a group that regularly gets together to have game nights (Magic the Gathering for those wondering). The group (7 guys, all M 28-32) rotates who hosts, with us hosting the most recent at our house. Once the guys start playing I will usually hang out with any wives/girlfriends that tag along or do my own thing. This time around no SO's joined so I was working on my own mtg deck (I also play) in the living room while the guys were playing in the connected dining room. A few noticed what I was doing between games and started asking about my build and eventually invited me to join in on a game.

&#x200B;

Now the newest guy, Paul (M28), has only been to our house once before so I haven't gotten a chance to know him as well as the others. He was originally at the other table but started watching my game once his ended. Paul pretty quickly started making little snarky comments about how I was playing, calling them ""friendly tips"" but would be things like ""wow, OP really doesn't seem ready to play if this is her deck"". It was making it hard to enjoy the game which I guess Dan picked up on because he told Paul to cut out the commentary, and that if I (OP) wanted help I would ask. Paul stopped during the game, but after the match was over made a comment to some of the guys that ""Maybe OP isn't ready to be jumping into matches if she isn't ready to hear criticism,"" that I should ""expect to hear comments if I'm going to make a deck that bad"", and I shouldn't play if I'm that sensitive.

&#x200B;

At this point I was pretty pissed so I told Paul if he had this big of an issue with me he was no longer welcome in my home and needed to leave. He tried to say it was my husband's game night and I couldn't kick him out, but Dan backed me up and told him he should pack up and go. Things got kind of awkward after he left and most of the guys took off not long after.

&#x200B;

I felt pretty solid in my decision, but today Paul has been blowing up their group chat saying he is pissed he got kicked out, and that I'm too sensitive for not seeing he was trying to help me. Most of the guys have backed me up, but 2 are saying I took his comments too hard, that he's just a blunt guy that means well, and that I need to apologize since he won't come back to any game night until I do. I've also gotten messages from the other guys partners who've said I probably should have just sat out instead of joining the game since it's ""guys night"", and that I need to suck it up so I don't make things awkward and ruin it for Dan.

&#x200B;

I don't know guys. I didn't feel like I was wrong in this but all the comments have me second guessing myself. Am I the asshole? Should I apologize to Paul for the sake of not ruining Dan's game night?",0
"My future SIL Liz has turned into a bridezilla and is going to war with everyone over every stupid thing.

My natural color is red. I love my hair. Liz is a blonde but she loves to have red hair and in fact ever since meeting me she's been dying her hair almost exactly my color. I don't mind, I think it's weird that she does it but I don't have a monopoly over this particular shade of red and she's free to do with her hair whatever she wants.

Well, she asked me this week that I should dye my hair to a different color because she wants her hair to be unique in her wedding, she offered to cover all the costs as well. I just said no because it's my hair, I don't want it changed.

I told my brother and he told me to do whatever I want because it's my hair, he said he'll talk to Liz to get her to back off. Well it didn't work because Liz has come to my parents and they've taken her side! They say it's her special day and we need to be more accomodating and it's important for our future relationship that we get along. I believe I am accomodating, she can do whatever she wants with her own hair! How is my hair any of her business anyway.

My parents tell me that I should be the bigger person. I don't know why an 18 year old should be the bigger person compared to the 27 year old Liz. They told me I'm making this minor issue into a big problem and I should just do what she wants because it's her wedding.

"I've never told anyone irl that I (15M) don't like being homeschooled but I thought I'd just mention it to my mum, not so I could go back to school but just so she knows how I feel I guess.

I said ""I don't like being homeschooled"" she didn't say anything for a few seconds and then asked me why I said it for no reason, she said I can just go back to school (she said it in a kinda mocking way though idk that's what it felt like at least) then she left the room.

My dad said I really upset her because she already feels like it's a bad idea and now I've said that it made her feel worse. I didn't mean to upset her how tf was i supposed to know she'd react like that and yeah I'm sure it sucks way worse for you than me. I'm not trying to sound selfish or anything but fucking come on.

My mum always asks me what's wrong when I look down or whatever and the first time I actually tell her, it's my fault? I feel so stupid too because my plan was to never tell them how I feel about homeschooling because I knew it would upset them, I don't even know why I said it It was such a dumb thing to do. I don't know if I'm in the wrong or not.

&#x200B;

I work and own a dairy farm i asked my brother if its ok i take his son to work with me whenever i Babysit otherwise i would get nothing done (i have proper safety precautions in place and he only comes with me in the tractor because it has a proper car seat) he said its fine my nephew loves the animals he makes all kind of excited noises and i try to encourage him to pet them when i hold him (they are all vaccinated and dosed regularly and calm again cleared with my bro) we spend a lot of time together. My brother and his wife have been trying to get him to say his first words although its not simple and they don't exactly make it easier, instead of mamma or dadda they coax him to say Mother and father and my nephew just dosent get it he's a baby and those words seem kinda complicated for a baby.

We where all over at my parents house for a Sunday get together and i was sitting playing blocks with my nephew, He suddenly looks up at me and starts going B B B B B BE BE i thought it was just normal baby talk then he gets more aggressive repeating those letters over and over again then He starts going N N N N N, he then shouts BEN and points at me and laughs BEN BEN BEN (my name) my brother and SIL start yelling at me saying i was coaching him and how i was being selfish, they immediately pick him up and My brother yells at me ""you took away his first word that was supposed to be our moment"" they storm off to another room they stay in there for about 10 mins and then come out and leave but as they are leaving the baby looks at me again and shouts in the playful baby voice BEN and points at me again my sil shouts at her son so her son starts crying then she shouts at him more starts crying herself and they leave

My parents think I'm an ass and i shouldn't have been teaching him my name, but i havent the only time he hears my name is when anyone else says it. they think i should apologise to My SIL for ruining why should have been a mothers special moment. But honestly My SIL dosent act like much of a mother, she dosen't work i have her son 5 days a week i refuse to take him on Saturdays and Sunday's because i want to get some nitty gritty work done and she throws fits about it, at family events hes always offloaded to me, to play with to feed (she pumps always has I'm not judging her for not doing direct breastfeeding btw) to calm down any tantrums and to change when he goes bathroom in his diapers.

what do you think reddit

EDIT: the argument that SIL had with her son went something like this 

SIl: say mother 

baby: Baby noises B B Ben more baby noises

SIL: SAY MOTHER 

Baby (with tears in his eyes and kind of sobbing): MMM M M B B B Ben (he said ben quitely this time)

SIL: NO YOU IDIOT SAY MOTHER NOW 

Baby (now crying): BEn ben ben 

SIL: (not so nice words that i dont feel like repating) SAY MOTHER

Baby (no full on crying and sniffling): dosent say anything

"**Throwaway. Please don't repost this somewhere else (my mom doesn't have Reddit but does have Instagram, etc. and I don't want her to find this as I do give out some identifiable details. Thank you!)**

I (24F) and my fiance (24M) have been together since our sophomore year of college, so around 5 years now.

For context, my mom (50F) had an affair with a coworker when I was 16, leading to my parents' divorce. She has been single ever since (going on dates but no serious relationships). I have a good relationship with my dad and his new wife. Sadly, my fiance's mom passed 2 years ago due to cancer and his dad (53M) has been single since.

My fiance proposed last year but our wedding was delayed due to COVID. Our families had never met up to this point because his family lives in South Carolina, whereas we're in North Carolina (where we went to college), around a 3 hour's drive away from his dad. 3 months ago, in January 2021, we decided that it was time to have our families meet for the first time to discuss our upcoming wedding in June 2021 (held in our backyard, COVID appropriate, immediate family only). My dad and his wife, my fiance's dad, and my mom all met at our place to meet and discuss the wedding. This went well, albeit there was some tension between my mom and my dad.

This morning, out of the blue, my mom called me and announced that she had eloped. I was shocked as she had not been dating anyone to my knowledge. Upon questioning, it turns out that she and my fiance's dad had been dating in secret since that meeting in January and had married in secret yesterday, making my fiance my ""stepbrother"" (I want to throw up just thinking about this). She said that I should now cancel my wedding because it would be inappropriate to marry my ""stepbrother.""

I'm absolutely horrified. I shouted at my mom, saying she ""just loves ruining my life"" and called her selfish - first she cheated on my dad, and now she went and married my fiance's dad, knowing full well I was about to marry my fiance.

My mom then said I was still young and I'd have the chance to meet someone new, but she's old and ""has to take every opportunity she's got,"" and so I was an ungrateful b\*tch for not approving of her ""marriage"". She then accused me of wanting her to die alone.

I don't think I'm the asshole, but I just wanted to make sure because ultimately I don't want her to have to be alone even though I think she did that to herself by hurting my dad. I think I should be allowed to marry my fiance as we met first. I'm also 12 weeks pregnant with my fiance's kid so that complicates matters more (we haven't told anybody yet).

AITA for being mad about my mom marrying my fiance's dad and because she said I can't marry my fiance anymore?

**Edit: I don't know much about whether it's legal to marry your ""stepbrother"" so if someone could confirm that would be great.**

EDIT 2: Mini update, we just called his dad. Apparently, he sees no issue with my fiance and I staying together, it was my mom who had an issue. Honestly, I still don't know how to feel about this because this still feels kinda gross to me. Will probably be going low or no contact.",0
"I’m 24 and I’m going to start this off by saying my mum is my bank manager.

I was drinking and not going to walk 5 miles. 

This isn’t the story. It’s just to set it up, so you know what I’m dealing with. 

Well my savings account has quite a bit in it - that was out there by myself, various members of my family for years of Christmas’s, birthdays and such. My mum haaaaates me spending any of that money. 

My fiancé and I are planning to move and we had to put down a holding deposit and a fee to take it off the market. I think it was all in all around £170. I would also like to point out that due to current circumstances we aren’t working and are just getting money from furlough. I didn’t have the £170 in my account but I thought wait... my savings!! 

I told my mum that I was going to dip into them and she went crazy. She said that she would rather me not to touch it, but she would send me ‘Christmas money’ and that will be for the house too. 

Ok! Sounds good to me. Thank you!

Well I ring her. She’s at costas, she will go for a drink and then do it when she straight away gets home. I say ok thanks, just that the letting agents closes at 4 because of it being Christmas Eve. 

(She doesn’t trust ping it or phone banking and likes to actually sign in and such on her laptop. I know. Old school)

She says ok. 

Time ticks by... it’s now 2. 
I ring her again. She’s now getting her last bits for Christmas Day. I say ok again and she tells me she will do it in 20 minutes.

The house place is calling me as I said I would be able to pay it straight away.

It’s now 3:30... I say fuck it and dip into my savings. We pay the holding fee and whatever and I breathe a sigh of relief.

Within minutes I get a call from her and she’s yelling at me that I’ve dipped into my savings. By now, I’m annoyed and I yell back and say that we have given her a few chances and she knew it needed to be paid by then. 

I say what she needs to do would have just taken 10 minutes. Just sign in, send money and that would have been it. She calls me a money grabbing spoilt child. I call her a dinosaur lol

I hang up. 

She’s now still not talking to me. My fiancé thinks that I shouldn’t have gone off at her and I should apologise to her. I kept ringing her on Christmas and she didn’t pick up once. I’m now leaving it until she contacts me. My dad thinks I should reach out and says ‘I can’t be like this with her’ 

I personally don’t think I should. I have no problems going into my savings account. It’s not like I was off getting beer or clothes with the money in it. Plus she knew that there was a time that we needed to pay things. 

Also she had been home multiple times before she would then leave and go out.",0
"My ex wife (30f) and I (30M) are still stuck in this long drawn out divorce going well over a year and a half already. My mom hasn’t shut up about convincing me to take her back because we’ve been together 15 yrs. My ex had an emotional affair for 5 months but because it wasn’t a physical one my family feels we should've worked it out since that’s what my ex wanted.  

8 months after leaving her I met my girlfriend Alice (28f) then when we decided to become a couple I went ahead and officially filed for divorce. My girlfriend is over 5 months pregnant with our little guy, but my mom hasn’t supported this at all even though she always complained about wanting grandkids.

We moved in together 2 months ago and right now my mom has regular appointments for physical therapy 3 times a week. I’ve been the one taking her because it’s an hour drive and she can’t be behind the wheel that long. Usually she makes the short drive to my place then we go to her appointment.

Sometimes I get there late so Alice lets her in to wait for me to get home. First time my girlfriend said my mom called my ex right there in front of her and was passive aggressively talking about how our place looks. Then she says she told my ex that she misses our old house. I told my mom that was extremely inappropriate. She acted like she didn’t do anything wrong since it’s not her fault my girlfriend was “eavesdropping” on their conversation….that she would obviously hear because they were in the same room.

Stupid little things like that. Bring up my ex wife or something from our past. On Monday she was over again waiting for me. We got into this big fight when Alice told me she’s done trying with her. 

My mom told her to stop trying to get some kind of approval, it’ll be a waste of time because I won’t be around her once I supposedly come to my senses about my ex and have a “real” family. I really don’t know what set off this kind of reaction out of my mom but knowing her it was probably random. My girlfriend was extremely upset. That made me see red. Safe to say my mom didn’t go to her appointment because I sent her home. 

My brother agreed to take her instead but I’ve also refused to help my mom in any way since she claims she doesn’t believe the family I’m making with my girlfriend is not real. She’s on a fixed income that barely cover half her rent. Since she doesn’t work my brother, sister and I pitch in every month on everything so she’s covered.

They’re coming down on me because they can’t afford to take care of her themselves. And while they get she is way out of line she relies on me for financial help. My mom has told me I can’t punish her for her opinion just because I don’t like it. Honestly her talking to me makes me want to help even less. But still I wanna know if that makes me an asshole since it does fall on my siblings too.",0
"i (19F) live with my fiancé (22M) and my best friend (17F) is gonna be moving in with us once she graduates HS. she comes over practically every weekend which isn't an issue at all, but yesterday she brought some stuff over from her house so she could bring it it and start setting up her room. 
she brought over an aloe plant and a ZZ plant (both of which are toxic to cats) and i made a comment about how we need to keep the cat out of her room. both my best friend and my fiancé keep getting really upset that im bringing it up and saying ""she'll (the cat) never learn if we don't let her in there."" 
im starting to get really frustrated because i really don't think it's out of the norm for me to be concerned about my pet eating plants that will 100% make her sick if ingested, but my best friend insists that her cats always chew on these plants and they're still completely fine. i'm just not sure if im overreacting or what, but i need some outside perspective.

"Some background: I was diagnosed with severe anxiety 14 years ago. My office has been home working for the past year & we have a lot of video and voice call meetings.

About 2 weeks ago I had a talk with Supervisor A (SA for short) & told her that meetings, especially meetings just to socialise make me extremely anxious. (Note: every email mentions these are optional meetings.) I can push myself through work related meetings because I know it’s what I’m being paid for- but these social meetings are killer for my anxiety. 

I said that I felt pressured to join these “optional” meetings because of how some of the incite emails are worded. I told her I’ve been hounded to join, & I always cave because of the pressure. Both the pressure and the meeting make me so anxious that I sometimes get physically ill. 

 She replied that I need to look like I’m a “team player” and that I should just show up but not say anything and just listen. She also mentioned that if I’m looking to transfer to a different department (I need to because I moved far from the office) that I need to show I’m a “team player” when it comes to meetings. 

Ive tried to just listen in but it still made me very anxious because people still asked me random questions even when I mentioned I was only listening in and not engaging. 

Yesterday I had a killer headache and messaged the group that I wouldn’t be in the catch-up. SA messaged back “not even just to listen? Ok” which came off as very passive aggressive to me. 

Within 5 minutes SB (who is aware of the talk I had with SA) emailed the team and said we wouldn’t be having a meeting (Likely due to some of the team being on annual leave and then I said I couldn’t). He added: “we put these in place for your benefit and to break up the work day- so it’s up to you if you want to take the opportunity to have an hour to talk to your coworkers.” 

This morning there was an email from SA to the entire office to setting up yet another weekly “optional” socialisation session. (Note: I am now up to a minimum of 3 of these per week minimum split between the department, team, and office). She added that when it comes to working from home, it’s important to be a “team player.” 

This immediately didn’t sit right with me because I have never heard her use this term except in our talk 2 weeks ago. She then added that “you may not feel like you need the support of your colleagues but they may need yours.” I had told her that I always cave to these “optional” meetings because of the pressure put on me. I feel like she is now using this against me as well as implying I am not a team player if I don’t attend, and that people NEED to talk to me. The amount of pressure implied by these comments makes it feel like it’s not optional. 

AITA for not wanting to attend these “optional” meetings?",0
"I’m a 41M single dad with a 13 year old daughter Lacey. My wife died in childbirth and it’s just been me and Lacey all her life. My sister has been a big help in raising Lacey, and we do keep in contact with her maternal grandparents. 

The issue started a couple of months ago when Lacey started her period. I knew this day would come so I spoke to my sister, my female best friend and my mother in law to be well prepared. I gave her the talk with her grandmother and aunt there, I buy her pads and tampons, I even have midol and heating pads ready for Lacey when she needs them. 

The problem began when I began to notice a smell coming from Lacey’s room. I went in to investigate and found pads and tampons openly disposed of in her wastebasket. I checked her bathroom and it was worse. She had her bloodstained undergarments in the tub.

I took out her trash and did my best to get rid of the smell, but I didn’t know what to do with the underwear in the tub. Later, I noticed bloodstains on the couch. It took a while of cleaning but I got them out. I figured that was the end of that.

It happened again last month, when I noticed Lacey’s room was stinking again. And I saw she didn’t even wash the underwear from before. The bathroom was unbearable at this point. Then earlier this week, I saw bloodstains on the couch again.

I sat Lacey down and told her that she had to learn to properly dispose of her feminine hygiene products and wash her underwear as the smell was becoming too much. And to be careful of getting bloodstains on the couch or anywhere she sits. I also noticed her sheets had a lot of bloodstains and brought this up too. I also let her know that it was okay to get blood on things as long as she washed them, and I wouldn’t be upset if I saw her bloodstained items being washed.

Lacey immediately blew up at me saying that periods aren’t gross and that I was period shaming and that I needed to educate myself on menstruation. I then got texts from my sister and MIL scolding me for making Lacey feel ashamed of her bodily functions. 

But I honestly wasn’t trying to convey that periods are gross. I was trying to convey that her hygiene needed to be addressed and that the smell was becoming unbearable. I just wanted to make sure that Lacey knew how to properly dispose of pads and tampons without it smelling, and that I wouldn’t be annoyed if she washed her bloodstained items 

AITA here? Was I period shaming my daughter?

EDIT:  so I’ve mentioned it in a few comments. I talked to my sister and mil and explained my side. They apologized for misunderstanding and like you guys, have given some good cleaning tips and they’ll talk to Lacey and help her out with the pads and tampons too

EDIT2: so many people here have suggested it and I’ve asked Lacey if her period pain is unbearable or just normal cramps, and left the choice to her as to whether or not she wants to see a specialist but the option is there for her!

EDIT3: We have washed the sheets with hydrogen peroxide and purchased some oxyclean for future instances should we need it. Many of you have also suggested period underwear, which again, I have asked her aunt and grandmother about and they’ll be able to give her more info about those as well as different hygiene products she can use.",0
"
Quick backstory: I M18 met and the girl I was seeing F18 (let’s call her sarah) met when we were 15. I would go as far as to say she was my first love. We went out. She ghosted me after we broke up back then, it was messy. However we became friends again a while later, we were on and off for about a year, (she would always stop talking to me),before I met someone else who I dated for a year. She got in and out of a relationship around the same time as me too. We met again towards the end of summer and things rekindled again. I fell for her very hard and she told me that she felt the same. However neither of us wanted to rush into a relationship straight away. That being said, we were very intimate with each other and we meet each other whenever we could. Things were great for about 2 months before one day something just flipped and all of a sudden she started treating me a lot differently. She didn’t want to see me as much anymore and told me that it was school and she needed to focus on that. However there were many instances over the last months where she was just nasty to me. She didn’t want to see me anymore and any time I brought up the idea of seeing each other, it’d be quickly brushed aside. I tried to talk to her about it on numerous occasions, and one time she just laughed at me. 
Recently I’ve been keeping my distance from her because it was just getting toxic. Last night we were both out, we talked a bit but not a lot, I wanted to leave it up to her to approach me. I saw her talking to my ex girlfriend at one stage (they didn’t know each other). Turns out they were talking about me, and Sarah was apologising to my ex girlfriend for some reason.  Later that night, I went to find Sarah to talk to her and when I found her, she was making out with another guy. I walked away, met her later and she acted like everything was fine. I said “I saw you making out with another guy, we’re done” and I stormed off. She found me later and a conversation ensued. She said “we aren’t going out, what’s the big deal”. Me and her had both agreed to be exclusive 2 months prior. Anyways, I ended up just laying everything out to her, how she’s treated me, how it’s made me feel, how I’ve lost all respect for her after I saw her with that other guy. I felt so sick of pretending I didn’t care that I just had to let it all out. I left then, and she texted me this morning. I laid it all out for her again, this time ending it with “i feel like such an idiot for letting you back into my life” and “I wish I never met you” before blocking her. She messaged me on WhatsApp later on, I ignored her initial messages, but she persisted, saying things like “I’ve been crying all day over the things you said to me”, (I just told her how she made me feel) “you mean so much to me, weve been through so much together, you can’t just stop talking to me”
I told her that im done forgiving her, and that she should stop texting me. am I the asshole?",0
"So I have been living with this dude for about 3 months and it has been a bumpy ride to say the least, but that is a story for another day.

Now because of unrelated reasons I made an agreement with him regarding my rent so I could essentially move out on a whim as the rental agreement is monthly if that makes sense. But I assured him that it would be likely I'd stick around for at least a year unless shit happens.

Well my roommate lost his job last month, I'll let you guess why, so he has been living of off his savings. His girlfriend also lost her job and has no savings so he moved her in.

Now at first I had no real issue with this despite not even being asked, after all I felt bad for them both but my patience has been wearing thin.

While I have my issues with my roommate as is, his girlfriend is ten times worse. She showers so little she literally smells sour sometimes, she pretty much hogs the living room for herself laying on the couch watching TLC, she literally eats everything in the fridge and replies with ""Oh whoops, sorry dude"" when I point out she has eaten my food again, she does absolutely nothing around the house despite obviously not working and so forth. Long story short, it feels like a broke Jabba the Hut has moved in to our place.

So after yesterday which was the second time this week she ate everything(Which was supposed to last  me a week.) I lost my shit, called my parents, loaded everything I own in their van and moved out and I informed my roommate via text that I won't be renewing the rental agreement.

Since then I have moved back home for the time being and my phone has been blowing up.

Roommate was apparantly relying on my money next month as his savings are running out quicker than expected(Guess why) and he is freaking the hell out saying shit like how I can't do this, hell even Jabba herself has reached out with an apology alongside a promise to be better because obviously she is realizing their predicament.

So Am i the Asshole?",0
"My mum and I do not have a good relationship. We used to be  close, but she always wanted me to be ""perfect."" She liked to control every aspect of my life, especially my love life. 

She introduced me to my ex-girlfriend, ""Kim,"" and pushed us together. Kim and I dated for a few years and had a child together. (which I now have primary  custody over). Though my mum wanted our relationship to be perfect, it was far from it. The years I spent with Kim was the worst years of my life, and I'm much happier without her. 

My mum thought Kim was the perfect girl for me. She was so upset when we broke up and grew angrier when I got together with my wife, ""Rosa."" Rosa is an amazing woman, but my mum refuses to get to know her because she's not Kim. I did not invite my mum to my wedding and I do not speak to her often. 

About a week and a half ago, Rosa and I went to dinner at this fancy restaurant. The dinner was supposed to be a nice evening away from everything. In the middle of our date, my mum and Kim come up to us. It was awkward but I assumed that they would say hello and then leave. 

My mum and Kim started to chat up Rosa. It was simple questions at first like, ""How is work?"" or ""How is your family?"" But even with those questions, I could tell that they weren't really listening. Their questions turned into passive-aggressive comments. My mum was saying, ""You look so pretty, dressed like you are single."" (She's not dressed ""appropriately"" for a married woman.) or ""It must have taken you hours to look half decent."" I thought it was mean for no reason.

Rosa wasn’t offended but rather taken-aback with how they were acting. She was, rather politely, asking them to leave us alone but they were not understanding. 

My mum told Rosa that she couldn’t leave us alone because “as a woman,” she knew that Rosa needed protection, seeing as she was ”dressed like a hooker.” Kim laughed and agreed with my mum.

I was frustrated. They had interrupted us, only to be rude and insult my wife. In frustration, I told them to get the fuck out of my face and to never contact me ever again. They left, cursing me out under their breath.

We had tried to enjoy the rest of our night, but my mum and Kim dampened our celebrations. My mum and Kim are still mad at me and want me to apologise. Rosa does not want me to do anything I don’t want to, but thinks that this may affect Kim and I’s  co-parenting situation.",0
"I (m32) have two older brothers (m38 and m40) and a sister (f34). Note the age differences. Our dad passed away 5 years ago in our hometown (a more suburban town in Wisconsin).

Our family was relatively modest when my brothers grew up, so they were cared for a lot by my parent’s families who are very conservative. My dad personally, was not. By the time me and my sister were born, our dad’s career was doing great and we were well off. Me and my sister have Master’s while our brothers didn’t go to college despite the funds and chances.

My mom had been trying to set my sister up with a churchgoer’s kid. This didn’t progress until around the time my dad died and my sister came back and helped with the funeral. My brother’s families are both in town as well. I worked in tech in China then and live in SF now and since the funeral have been mostly LC with everyone except my sister. Honestly, I was very close with my dad and there was obvious favoritism towards me which the others didn’t like. So, my mom and oldest brother now technically live in my house.

My sister somehow ended up leaving her career and moving back. She married the man my mom set her up with in 2019. I honestly was in shock at the wedding. I really didn’t ever see my sister living on a farm and becoming a stay at home mom. I knew for a fact my mom and brothers had a huge part in this, because there were a lot of “she’s back home” posts. Later I found out that she had pretty much given all her savings to her husband.

Late 2020, my sister, straight out of the blue started calling me and just “chatting” about things. I of course, love this. Early in 2021, my mom told me she was pregnant. I immediately asked my sister about this and she kinda broke down. In short, the husband has been abusive, she’s broke and my family and her in laws haven’t helped. My oldest brother wailed at her about how his wife went through the same thing and my sister should stop thinking she’s special. The first time she called me, he had kicked her out of their home for complaining about their finances. This was fairly common.

This is where IATA: I basically yelled at her too. I told her that she had a career which she can still go back to and I can help her move back to NYC (where she worked / studied before). And that the pregnancy wasn’t the end of it and there were other options.

The next day she asked me for 5k which I sent to her without asking. I didn’t hear much after and didn’t intrude coz it was a total mindfuck. A month later my sister told me she had gotten a new job in NYC and filed for divorce. The pregnancy is also no longer on the table.

Now my family has been blowing up my social media calling me all sorts of shit. I’ve in general called them shit back as well and the home might be on the market soon. My sister needed to switch apartments and got a restraining order against her ex and well… things aren’t great, but I’m happy my sister is better. So AITA?

Edit: I messed up a date and fixed some grammar.

Edit: Wow, I just woke up and did not not expect a response like this. Thank you everyone, this helps a lot!
I saw a couple of posts mentioned they had been in the same predicament as my sister and I’d really like to say that you aren’t alone. Please, please reach out to those you have ever been close to.",0
"I (F13) have classes at noon and ends around 5:00 pm. My sister ( F18 ) is a smart and an academic achiever so she usually gets big money while I'm a high average student, well this happened today.

My sister who has been suffering from a stomach ache for the past 3 days ( I think ) texted me around 4 pm ( which I was in class and we were learning about important topics.

I came home with a bag of French fries and later helped my sister on folding the clothes, she then told me "" I texted you about buying a drink with ur money, I'm going to pay it back yknow ""
I was confused since my phone was on low battery and couldn't access my phone since my teacher was discussing, and I didn't trust her. It's just I had a previous experience on her loaning my money and not paying it back and she still hasn't gave me the money.
So I told her "" You could've just bought it yourself when ur stomach isn't hurting, you've been here for 5-6+ hours and only on 4pm you decided to text me when you can just buy it somewhere. "" I said somewhere since there is a literal store with the drink she's making me buy like 2 houses away.
Even though my stomachache hurts I can manage on going to a store and bought the drink to help to ease the pain.

I was mad since She's making me buy something with my own money, but whenever I try to make her buy something for me and say I'll pay it back after I get it ( when she pays my stuffs I ordered, I always pay it back after I arrived ) she gets mad at me because why would I order her around.
But when I get mad at her for making me buy something with my own money she expects I will do it? Never.

Am I the asshole?
I might have overreacted a little bit, but I was honestly tired since after I came home, I ate my food ( I didn't even finish it ) and she ordered me to do stuffs and that when we started arguing.",0

"My Mother (50F) has started to act strange.for example with a bit if context, my room is not the most organised place but it is not messy, I (18F)  am in my last year of school currently and at the time of the story I was revising for my mocks, I had left the house for only three hours to go out with a friend I had not seen for over a year, but when I got back my room had been cleared of all my belongings, excluding my bed, desk, mirror and my side table which she had emptied out.

 For me this came as a huge shock as I had gotten good grades recently of A\*BB, my psychotic mother(not a doctor just a thought) had put all belongings in bin liners very carelessly might I add as a lot of my things were broken due to this. I at this point was crying my eyes outs my room is the only place that I have control over, she had gone through all of my personal belongings such as my diary, vapes and cigarettes all of which she knew about previously.

I had to call her when I did I screamed at her calling her sick for taking everything out of my room in her words 'if its not gone by the morning(atm it was 10pm) I'll just burn it'. I was not okay like wtf it had all of my school work in from the last 6 years which would take me years to make up for. ill shorten the next bit for convenience, I moved things to my car and the next day I went to my best-friends house.

However, my sister was in on it too she (19F) I was close with and came to my room in the night and screamed at me calling me ungrateful and how full of myself I was to even think I would cry over that all my things had been taken for my room.

AITA for being ungrateful for my mother 'cleaning my room'",0
"On mobile, format might be weird. 

Background: I've been living in my house for about 5 years now when my neighbor moved in two years ago. Let's call him D. D rented his garage to T. This is when the screaming and yelling matches started. 

When he rented to T, I began hearing arguments about rent, threats of eviction, gossip, everything. I know the amount of T's rent, her friends, her job, D's business, his friends, etc. They yell EVERYTHING to each other. On top of this, when T is late on rent or left the gate open, or when D doesn't clean his yard or check mail, they will scream at each other and call each other profanities. This occurs at any time of day. I've heard them at 7 a.m. to 12 a.m. it occurs daily. Cops have been called several times to their residence. 

Back to T and D. I have two dogs. One is a lover boy and he's 7. I've had the younger one, Delta, for almost a year now and he's just past a year old. He loves talking to me. I've trained him to not bark indoors. When I let my dogs out to play, I let them run around the yard and let Delta bark. 

The situation: Delta barks when he hears someone knock and will bark at the neighbors when they yell at each other when he is outside. Recently, T has started screaming ""STOP"" at Delta. He does not. Now, I may be biased since I don't care for my neighbors, but T's voice sounds like a shrill banshee needing to mate. She Is high pitched and whiny. D's voice isn't much better. Anyway, I haven't told them anything. I haven't bothered or yelled at all. I thought T was yelling stop at D, but realized it was at my dog. I brought him inside and tested it the next day. Sure enough, I let the dogs out and Delta starts barking at T because he hears her. She's yelling STOP again. After, I hear her yell at D, ""fucking weirdo won't take care of their dogs. I can't stand that barking, you hear that shit?"" D agrees. Now, I take care of my dogs. I play with them and walk them and they are my babies. They're happy. 

The third time T yelled at my dogs to STOP, I yelled over the fence that she has no right to yell at my dogs and to leave them alone. She laughed and yelled back that ""I should take care of them"". 

I can still hear them yelling daily, especially when my dogs play. Now, when I'm outside and they're outside yelling, I grab my speaker and place it on the tree right next to the fence, put it on its loudest setting and play the 10 hour screaming goat on loop. It drowns out their screaming. I figure that I've put up with their voices and screaming for two years and that I'd rather hear a goat screaming rather than them. I don't play it any time, only when they're yelling at each other. 

I told this to a friend and they're calling me AH and petty. 

Tldr: neighbors scream at each other constantly, turned to screaming at my barking dog and I drown them out by playing the 10 hour screaming goat back at them. AITA?

Edit for clarification: I don't let my dogs bark all hours of the day. I'm outside when they play and it is more yelps of playing than barking. Delta barks more specifically when the neighbors are yelling and stops when the goat screams start.

For those asking about what I've been using for the goat screams, I use these two audios: https://youtu.be/PUT3SWIQd_Q

"Background information on me: I(20) have mobility issues that occurred in part because of a fall down a flight of stairs when I was a teen. I ended up breaking my foot, damaging tendons in my ankle, and the cartilage in my knee. I hadn't realized that it was a severe injury for multiple years and by the time I went to the doctors and got physical therapy, they could only try to salvage what muscle I had left. I typically use a knee and ankle brace at work, and either a cane or a wheelchair when I'm just away from home.

Now, for the story. My friend, J(24) had their birthday yesterday. They invited me around a month ago. I asked if it was okay for me to bring my wheelchair, to which they said yes. I took my own car so that I could fit it in the trunk without being a bother to my friend on their birthday. J invited 3 other people to their party, (not including their partner), and we all drove to a city a little over an hour away to meet with J's partner at the end of the night.

I was awake from 9 am until around 1 am, and had stayed up late the previous night painting a gift for J. Going without much sleep for a long period of time can exacerbate the amount of pain that I'm in. Around halfway through the day, I was already feeling exhausted, but J pulled me aside and asked if I could leave my wheelchair behind for the mall. J said a bunch of stuff but it basically boiled down to ""Please don't bring your wheelchair because it will inconvenience us.""

I had already been skimping on using it for the previous few activities because they just weren't wheelchair accessible. At the time, I was thinking ""oh, it's my friends birthday, and I haven't been to a birthday party in around 5-6 years by now. I don't want to ruin this for them, so no problem!"" And continued to use my cane and knee brace as a combo.

The problems started to arise during the trip into the mall. Note about my knee and ankle braces: they tend to irritate my skin if I wear them for too long. By the time we were walking around the mall, I could already feel my foot going numb and the skin beneath my knee brace felt like it was raw. I probably would have just dealt with it if it hadn't been for one of J's friends having a fear of escalators. J went out of their way to accommodate her. Towards the end of the night, I ended up just taking both the braces off for at least some form of relief from the raw pain. At that point, I just wanted at least for my skin to be spared. I used only my cane until the night finally ended.

Today I had work, and every part of me that I had put strain on yesterday was sore and fatigued. Despite this, I'm still worried that I would have come off as entitled if I asked, or ruined my J's plans which were clearly meant for able bodied people. I would have left earlier if I wasn't giving a ride home to the other people.

So, would I have been the asshole if I had asked my friend to let me use my wheelchair?",0
"My older brother (Mike - 28M) got engaged to his girlfriend (23F). As per tradition, our parents said they'd throw them an engagement party and of course, invited me. I (26F) am beyond happy for him.

I moved away for college when I turned 18 and I've been very busy ever since so I don't visit home very much. I didn't even make it to Christmas for a few years.

Luckily for me, Mike's engagement party was on my golden weekend. I travelled 6 hours by plane and made it to the party and congratulated Mike in person. Also, I got to see my aunts, uncles, cousins and everyone I hadn't seen for a long while. They were asking about what I was doing, how my rotations were, similar questions etc.

Mike pulled me aside and told me to please stop stealing the show again on his godd##n engagement party. I was confused. All I did was literally show up. So I asked him what was going on. He said I kept outdoing him at everything and even stole the show on his engagement party.

Background info, between the two of us, I was the calm, academically inclined one who was a straight A student, and recently started residency. He was the artistically inclined troublemaker. However, from my perspective that was 8 years ago and I only visited a handful of times during these years.

I told him I was sorry and asked him what he would like me to do. He told me to stop doing what I was doing, and not brag about my job, dating life or anything else. Mind you, I was being asked questions, not bragging. I thought he simply wanted me to leave his party based on this and left, saying he could enjoy the spotlight as he pleased. I was honestly sad that he wasn't at all happy to see me and was mostly angry.

My parents kept calling me asking me to come back but I said I didnt want to disturb Mike's night. My parents think I was an AH and caused a scene, as does Mike. I told them about Mike's comments and they are now outraged at him. Everyone's in a conflict more or less. AITA?",0
"This is going to be hard to explain, so let me try and simplify things.  

So, for the last few generations in my family, the first born son in each generation is given the same name, let's say John Jacob Doe for anonymity's sake because this name is linked to an ancestor of ours who served in the Civil War and is considered to be the patriarch of the family.  In my generation of the family, the bearer of this name would be known as John Jacob Doe VI.  

My dad was JJ Doe V, Grandpa was JJ Doe IV and so on and so forth.  Dad had three children and when his first child, my older sibling, was born, he named 'him' JJ Doe VI.  

If I'm being vague about gender, it's because my older sibling came out as transgender several years ago.  Reactions has been mixed, but for the most part our immediate family supports my older sister.  

When it came time for her to file an application to change her name, I decided that I wanted to do the same for myself.  Only, since my sister was no longer going to be going by JJ Doe VI, I wanted to be known by that name.  

I have several reasons to do this.  The first is that I always hated my name because of all the bullying I got for it (btw, anyone who names their son Lindsey, you are a fucking asshole.  Sorry Mom and Dad, but you really dropped the ball there).  The second was that I was always closer to my dad and dad's side of the family.  My dad died when I was in my teens, so when I call myself JJ Doe VI, I feel more closely connected with him.  The third was that I didn't want to see this tradition die out.  I know that it would die out eventually, but I am not ready to see this name go just yet, and I have dreams of naming my own son JJ Doe VII one day.  We really don't have that many traditions or hereditary keepsakes so this name is something I really value.  

My mom and older sister both agreed that I can change my name to JJ Doe VI.  I don't know what my dad or grandfather would have thought since they died years before my sister came out.  But several other relatives have been indignant about this change.  Surprisingly enough, they aren't pissed at my sister for changing her name but at me for ""usurping"" her position as the firstborn.  They believe that since my sister was still the ""first born male"", she should keep the name.  It's BS, I know.  I have a few relatives who refuse to acknowledge that she changed her name for what mom and I think are pretty legit reasons and still call her JJ.  They also think that I am a massive asshole for stealing her name, and what they interpret as her birthright.  

So, this is going to be complicated, but AITA?  And if not, who is?  This is all really confusing.

TL:DR: There is an old name that has been passed down my family for generations.  The latest holder of the name came out as transgender, so I got permission from her to change my name to the heirloom name since she isn't going by her old name anymore.  Relatives are pissed and view me as the usurper to my sister's birthright.

Edit:  I probably should have also mentioned that my sister has been my biggest supporter.  She always said that JJ Doe VI suited me better than her.",0
"Me (25f) had a family dinner with my fiancé, and my sister (22f) also attending. I happened to have my period and go to the toilet a few more times than usual in the afternoon. My sister supposedly asked my fiancé about why I'm going so frequently, because during the dinner, she started to talking to me about how I'm ruining my health with using tampons instead of free bleeding.

She's been doing it for years now, and she kept on explaining why I should do it too, how healthy it is, how easier it made her life etc. 
I told her to stop, dinner is not the time to talk about this, and she still went about how it's only natural. My fiancé started getting visibly uncomfortable, and so did I, with my whole appetite gone. Me and my fiancé left early, and my parents (and sister) think I overreacted, but I honestly felt disgusted talking about period blood while dinner, and my sister told me I'm not invited next time for making a scene. 

I honestly don't know if I overreacted or not, it's just a sensitive topic for me apparently, and not my family.",0
"I collect scrunchies. I have 86 so far, all in various materials. Some cheap drugstore finds, some made of pure silk. I have a lot of memories attached to them, becacuse they were gifts from people I love, or I bought them at places I visited.

Today my mom's friend came to visit us with her granddaughter. The little girl is 3 and has super long hair which was tied with a headband that broke during their visit. My mom's friend asked us if we have any headbands and then my mom suggested I give her one of my scrunchies. I refuse and search for a regular headband but my mom is already taking them to my room to show the little girl my collection. And she being a 3 year old falls in love with a big holo scrunchie that just happens to be the one my friend gave me for my birthday this year. I just couldn't part ways with it, or any of them for that matter. 

The girl starts crying, her grandma got kinda mad at me and my mom is furious. She called me immature, selfish and a bunch of other stuff that really hurt, which I think is not fair. This is my collection, its monetary value isn't very big but its sentimental value is huge to me. But I did feel bad because the girl was basically crushed, and now my dad thinks I'm childish too. AITA?",0
"Okay this is more of a what should I do rather than an AITA. So my sister (19) and I (18) share rooms and we have been for a long time so it’s safe to say we’re pretty close and comfortable with each other. The other day my niece (2) was watching YouTube kids on my sisters iPad when a text message appeared on the screen, my niece trying to swipe up on the message accidentally presses it, the message on the screen was a response to a video of my sister unclothed in the shower to which she sent to her new boyfriend. I don’t know much about her boyfriend bc she’s very private about him but I was traumatized to say the least. Since than I have not been able to stop thinking about it to the point we’re I can’t even look at her sometimes I really want to talk to her about what I saw bc we always talk about what harm sending things like that can cause but idk… is that an invasion of privacy to talk to her 🤷🏽‍♀️ give me some advice?",0
"I (28 year old male) Work with my Girlfriend (28 year old female) work together at a restaurant. The place isn't hugely popular, but we live in a small town, so there are a lot of locals who enjoy our food. My girlfriend has recently been going down a rabbit hole of ghost/supernatural related content, like podcasts and YouTube videos. She's always been a bit spiritual, and I don't mind that at all. Unfortunately, she seems more paranoid about this than passionate, which is why I'm concerned. She's been avoiding anything even remotely related to evil spirits or ghosts in general, and she's been keeping all kinds of rocks and salt and herbs to prevent any ""evil"" from entering the house. While I've been a bit concerned, I haven't been mad at her for it, since it didn't affect our daily lives too much. However, things went downhill. Over the weekend, I decided to go to the restaurant to do some interior design, since she'd been complaining about the place being too boring. I put up some mirrors, put some lights outside on the patio, and some LED lights for the bar. I called her to come down to the restaurant, hoping to surprise her with the new and improved interior. At first, she looked really excited to see the place so decorated, then her face fell. She looked over at me and started yelling at me about how I'd put the mirrors facing each other, and how that created a vortex or something. She was screaming about how ghosts are probably already haunting the place. She looked like she was on the verge of tears. I tried to comfort her, but she stormed out of the place, sprinting for her car to drive back to our house. I felt bad, and took the mirrors down from the wall. She was very quiet the next few days, until she eventually started talking to me again like nothing happened. I feel like I need to confront her about this, but I'm not sure how, or if I'm even qualified to do it without just being a douche. So, am I the asshole?",0
"We live in a house and we rent rooms. I (24f) share the house with Alexa (23f), Brit (21f), Mark (21M) and Paul (22M).

Last year, we had already troubles with Brit (P,M&A are new this year). She's a mess and also her boyfriend, who stays over like 6 times a week. Now Mark and Paul are two big pigs too and won't clean either.

Alexa and I have teamed and we share our own kitchen stuff. We have a key of each other's rooms.

This has been an issue and after A LOT of long talks we have given up. I'm not asking for a spotless house, I'm just asking for BASIC stuff to be done, like brooming onion rests of the floor, not leaving the counter full of pepper seeds and tomato, not leaving the things in the sink for over a week...Having a plate available when I go to make dinner...

They say 'they are studying' but I, and Alexa, study, work part-time jobs and do a lot of stuff and STILL clean after ourselves.

Recently I've purchased a Roomba(R) for my room and I let Alexa use it.

We use it in the common areas only when we are at home so we can take it back to my room when it finishes. The R stays in my room. I've not given permission to anyone besides Alexa to touch it.

Last Sunday I was cleaning after breakfast and since the kitchen floor looked like a DIRTY PUB'S floor.I put the R on. My phone notifies me when the R is done. I was starting to get suspicious because it was taking way too long.

I went downstairs and the R noise was coming from Mark's room.

I open the door and find MY R there.I was super mad because Mark and I can't see each other. He's the piggest of them all and we don't even say Hi to each other.

He knows it's mine and he doesn't have permission also it's expensive and his room is a mess and it can damage my R by letting it get caught in his dirty socks and stuff. So I stormed inside and I got my R. He started yelling at me to get out that I was violating his space. I told him if he ever again touches my stuff I'm going to do the same.

He called me crazy and said it was just a robot. I told him it was MY ROBOT and that for someone who doesn't give two fucks about cleaning it was funny he decided to grab it and bring it into his PIGPEN. Brit came and told me I was over reacting.

I told them I'm sick of them and I'm talking to the landlord about how they treat the house and the common areas.

UPDATE:  (WE ARE NOT IN THE US)Alexa and I CALLED  the landlord and he came. We showed him everything and he was shocked. He told us, he's talking to them and if we find 3 other people to fill their rooms, he would break the contract. That is legal, since we have a 'Bedroom contract' and since we pay monthly that means, any part can end the contract at the end of any month. That's great bc we really love the house and it's affordable. So Alexa and I have started to look for people to see if we can get them to move in during April (we don't want to be mean and have the other three kicked with 2 days notice and we want to take time to find people that suit us).  
 He told us he's doing this bc he, reformed the house and it's a family one and he knows Alexa and I take care of everything and we deep cleaned an old patio in September and we made it look nice and clean. So he knows, his family house is in better hands with us.

UPDATE 2: Landlord told them they have until the last day of match to live here and Brit went crazy on ME saying I was the drama. I told her I’d rather be the drama than a pig with no consideration. Alexa and I are looking for new roomies ☺️",0
"This is my(18m) first relationship. Her(18) mother bought a champagne dress for her to wear to her aunt's wedding. She put it on and showed me. I told her she looks really beautiful in it then went back to reading. A couple of minutes later she asked if she looks fat in the dress. I glanced at her, looked for a second and then told her no.

She got really upset, saying that I should be able to say that she's not fat without looking. I only looked because I wanted to be able to answer completely honestly. Was I wrong?",0
"I (18f) love my boyfriend (21m) but yesterday we got into an arguement that made me very upset. 

Yesterday my boyfriend and I were watching a movie together and I was sitting on his lap. I got up to get drinks halfway through, but when I sat up I noticed that there was blood on his jeans. Moments later he noticed it too, and I apologised, realising I must have started my period.

My boyfriend freaked out and started shouting at me, asking why I'd ruined his favourite jeans. He stomped up to the bedroom and slammed the door.

I felt pretty upset and guilty, especially when I checked my period tracker and realised I was due to start today, and I should have been more wary that I was close to starting my period.

Today he's apologised for shouting, but says he still upset about the jeans. He thinks I should have been more careful knowing that I was due to start my period today. I've tried to wash the jeans but they're still stained. I feel guilty but also upset that he got so angry with me.

So, am I the asshole?",0
"I took my daughter (10) to France for a week (We’re from UK) for a holiday. She missed no time off school and it didn’t effect her contact with her dad. We have a child arrangements order and legally I’m allowed to take my daughter anywhere without permission or notice as long as it doesn’t effect contact. (I checked with a solicitor) 

When I booked the holiday I sent a WhatsApp message to my daughters dad to tell him I was taking her on holiday. I gave the dates, the location and travel details. There is a big but, I know he has me blocked on WhatsApp so I knew he’d never see the message. 

I knew if he knew he’d kick off and try and ruin our holiday. I know I’m not legally obligated to tell him about our holiday, but I thought it would help the situation if I could say, well I did send him the details. 

Anyway we get to France and we’re having a great time. My daughter decided to call her dad for a chat. I told her she can tell him whatever she likes (it’s up to her if she tells him we’re on holiday) but I did warn her that he probably doesn’t know and might be unhappy. 

Part way through the call she mentions we’re in France and he goes ballistic. Screaming, shouting etc.. he demanded to speak to me. I got on the phone, but couldn’t get a word in for all the screaming so I ended the call. 

He starts blowing up mine & my daughters phone demanding we return to the UK immediately. He was threatening to have me arrested for abduction etc…

I calmly sent him a message stating we are on holiday, we’ll be home before he is due to see daughter and that daughter is happy, healthy and enjoying a holiday. I told him that he’s welcome to call and text her but please not stop screaming & shouting as it’s distressing her. 

He text back calling me an AH and saying he’ll see me in court. 

AITA?

ETA - Whenever my ex doesn’t like something he keeps our daughter and refuses to return her. I’m then forced to apply to the court (That costs £300 fyi) then just before court or once we’ve missed whatever he intended to ruin he brings her back. The court the say there is no issue and life resumes.  It’s a terrible system, but it’s what we have so I deal with it.

He has pretty minimal contact as it is (2 weekends a month) I have a non molestation order against him, but we can communicate about our daughter and obviously I have to see him at handovers. He has me blocked on every platform, but he unblocks me whenever he wants, then blocks again. (My daughter has her own phone that she called him from) 

I understand nothing about this situation is ideal, my daughter has begged me for 2 years to go to Disneyland and I so badly wanted to make this dream possible for her. I’m pretty sick of living a life where so much is controlled by my ex, this is the first time I’ve really gone against him and decided to just do what I wanted.

ETA 2 - I have a court order (Child Arrangement Order) it clearly states I can take my daughter out of the country for up to 28 days without notification or permission from her dad. Please stop telling me I broke the law; I did not, like I said above I even double checked with my solicitor before booking the holiday.",0
"For context, I'm adopted and have super long & very thick red hair. No one in my adopted family has hair like mine,and it's been kind of a thing for them to touch, admire, & talk about my hair at family gatherings since I was a kid. My aunt has lung cancer, and it's really taken a toll on her. She's lost all her hair and has talked about getting a wig, but they're too expensive and she says she wants real hair. My mom suggested I donate my hair to make a wig for my aunt at Easter dinner, and my aunt got so excited she started crying. I felt horrible about it, and didn't say anything. We went to this wig place and the lady said she could make a shoulder length wig for my aunt using my hair. (I keep it up extremely well & it's down to my knees) My aunt started crying again and again I feel so awful, but I really don't want to part with my hair. I know it grows back but still.

No one had asked me how I felt, but I think my mom could tell I wasn't very excited about it because she asked the lady if she could donate her own hair, and she said she'd need both my sister (mom's biological daughter) and my mom to donate their hair, since it's very thin, and she could only make a chin length wig with it. My aunt also wants red hair, so the lady said she'd have to dye it & that would cause it damage & cost more than using my hair. My uncle then said it'd make much more sense to use mine.

It's been a month and my aunt wants to know when we can make the appointment. I don't know what to do. I told my sister and she called me ungrateful and told me to stop being selfish because it would grow back. If I'm TA I won't hesitate to donate it but I don't know anymore.

EDIT: People suggested I clarify, I have knee length hair & I'd have to cut all of it off to the scalp in order to make the wig.

To all the people saying it doesn't take that much hair to make a wig: it does. One average donation of hair doesn't make a full wig, they match it with other donations. It usually takes 2-3 heads of hair for a full wig. Mine is long enough on its' own for a full wig, and my aunt doesn't want synthetic hair mixed in to supplement it.
I completely understand everyone that said I was the asshole for not saying no in the beginning. I'm not trying to justify that, but I want to make it clear that it's extremely difficult for me to stand up to my family. I don't think I've ever had a say in anything since I started living with them, and that's how it's always been. They never give me a voice, even though I should have spoken up. It always goes without saying that what my mom says will happen.",0
"Throwaway because I'm gonna reveal some medical info and some IRL people know my main account.

Wife had a C Section about 3 months ago. She was prescribed Norco (Hydrocodone) for the pain. We filled the prescription (20 pills) and then she never took it. She used Motrin and Tylenol only. The pill bottle went into the medicine cabinet in the bathroom where we forgot about it.

Fast forward to Christmas Day. We don't want to take an infant around to all our families gatherings in flu season, so we stayed home and invited anyone over who wanted to stop by during the day.

My wife's sister (so my SIL) Jane and her boyfriend Bob came by. Jane and Bob have been dating for a few months. I never met the guy before. My wife met him once. My point is that I don't know this dude from Adam, but he seemed like a nice guy. They stayed for a while, played with the baby, exchanged some presents, and we all had a good time before they left to go to their next stop.

A few days later, Jane calls my wife irate and screaming. Bob stole the Norco. He is apparently a recovering addict who has been clean less than a year. We obviously didn't know this. He has now vanished. His work hasn't heard from him, his parents haven't heard from him, and Jane hasn't heard from him. He could be on a bender or dead for all we know. Jane went to his apartment when he wasn't responding to her and that's when she found the empty pill bottle with my wife's name on it and called us screaming.

SIL blames us and is beyond pissed, which I can understand. She needs an outlet for her anger. What I don't understand is about half the family blames us too. They understand we didn't know about Bob's addiction history, but they said having unused narcotic medication just sitting around is irresponsible and we created this problem. It's causing a bit of a rift between the people blaming us and those not blaming us, and we (and my mother and father-in law) are caught in the middle because SIL has been on a rampage against us for ""destroying her life.""

I'm trying to be empathetic to Bob and SIL, but I don't agree. First, we legitimately forgot about it. Neither of us take medication regularly, and we had a newborn to deal with, so we weren't thinking about a bottle of pills in the corner of the medicine cabinet. Second, Bob didn't know the pills were unused. We don't know him and he doesn't know us. For all he knew, my wife could have a chronic condition and need those pills. It's not like he would recognize the prescribing doctor's name is an obstetrician. Am I not allowed to have medicine in my own house on the off chance that a recovering addict will come by and see it? 

I think Bob is firmly the asshole here and my wife and I don't have any responsibility. If we had known he was an addict and still left the pills out, then maybe, but we didn't know.

But, I don't have any experience with addiction or even taking narcotic pain meds, so maybe I am the asshole for not being more diligent about getting rid of the pills. 

AITA?

EDIT: Thanks all. 

I'm glad my initial reaction wasn't off base. For those asking how anyone could blame us, scroll down to the ESH verdicts because a few posters have nailed the exact things some of the family is saying. Not so much that it's our fault Bob stole the pills, but that we are ""part of the problem"" that has allowed the opioid crises by not securing or disposing of the pills.",0
"The air conditioner broke last week while I was out of town and my wife had to call an emergency technician in the middle of the night. 

A company we’d used before without issues sent a guy over. He fixed the air conditioner no problem, but once he’d left I woke up to a million missed texts and calls from my wife, who was hysterical. 

Apparently within minutes of showing up he made comments about her body and other suggestive statements. She made it clear she wasn’t interested without being outright rude because she didn’t want him to get mad and leave without fixing the air conditioner. 

The tech kept trying to put moves on her, then after he’d fixed the A/C, he didn’t leave right away, trying to feed her some lines about how she seemed to be home alone and he could “spend the night to make sure she was safe.” 

Eventually he realized he was driving down a dead end and left, but the whole thing just really freaked her out, having some guy in the house who didn’t leave when asked and everything. 

I was pissed to hear about all this, and she was shaken up by the incident, so we left a review on their Google and Yelp pages saying what had happened. 

The company is pretty small so the owner called me to apologize a couple days later and said the tech had had a few drinks that night, not expecting to be called out to an emergency job, and that “his sense of humor had clearly been misinterpreted” by my wife. 

He asked me to take my review down because it called the tech out by first name and apparently a review saying he was coming onto a female customer could cause some personal problems for the guy. 

The owner also reasoned that the business was an air conditioner repair business, not a bedside manner business, and that they did fix the air conditioner, so deserved a higher rating. 

I told them our review stands, and they basically said we were assholes for threatening the reputation of their business and the personal reputation of the tech over a single misunderstanding. 

On the one hand, they did fix the air conditioner, and that’s what we called them to do. On the other hand, I feel like this is relevant information for people considering hiring them, even if it was a one time thing.

"So me,(22F), and my boyfriend, (23M), got invited to the bar by our friend who we’ll call Dan. Dan told us to meet him at this bowling alley/bar and my boyfriend didn’t really want to go at first but agreed when I said I’d buy drinks. We finally get to the bar and pool area where we spotted Dan playing pool with some people we didn’t know. We went up to him and he gave us both a big hug and introduced us to his friends. I think it would be helpful at this point to explain that all of Dan’s friends are hicks, (not a bad thing at all, just the best description as we live in Idaho for everyone else to understand), and my boyfriend is black. 

Everything was going good and we settled in and got some drinks. Not even 10 minutes later one of them says the N word. My bf looked extremely uncomfortable but Dan was outside so he didn’t hear what happened. When he came back in he asked my bf and I if we wanted to take shots and I declined and said we were leaving. Dan looked confused so I told him it’s because one of his friends said the N word and my bf didn’t know him like that. Dan tried to console my boyfriend and told him we should stay and he declined again because he felt uncomfortable and unsafe. Then Dan said “well you’re my ride home” so I stepped in and this is where I might be TA. 
My bf was still in the middle of pool because he wanted to at least finish the game before we left so Dan sat down next to me. He said “he didn’t mean it like that” and I said, “I don’t care how he meant it, it made my bf uncomfortable and you didn’t even care or say something to your friend.” He went on to try to defend his friend some more so I finally got tired of it and said “If you wanna leave with us after this game you can but if you’re gonna continue to double down and be friends with people like that, then respectfully you can walk your ass home.” He looked really hurt. 
After that I closed out our bar tab and we left. I feel a little guilty but my bf said I did the right thing. AITA? ",0
" 

I have severe insomnia. I am in absolute need of 8+ hours to function or else i will lose concentration, severe headaches, faint, get sick very easly ( I am sick 9/12 months every year because of my sleep) While you may have some helpful tips I can assure you they will not work. The only thing that I need is absolute silence to sleep ( 20 years of experimenting with every trick, doctor, pshciatrist + sleep therapist in the book ). A tiny noise ( with ear plugs + ear muffles ) is enough to ruin the entire night for me. Once I wake up i don't sleep. I have tried everything from a-z with sleeping medication, however if i don't get to sleep on them ( which i usually don't ) i can be so drowsy/medicatedd i forget i took one so i take another one, and i take another one. After one overdose I don't dare to try them again. Simple ones like melatonin is like brining a sword to world war 3.

I need to have a set sleep routine to manage it as best as possible, which means I go to bed at 23:00 and get up at 08:00 every day without fault. My girlfriend wakes up at 05:00. Her alarm will wake me up ASAP and i will be wide awake and i won't be able to sleep, if i was lucky I had 6 hours sleep, a few days of this and i get sick ( yay good genes ). Lucky for me she only wakes up 05:00 3 days a week. She will also snooze the alarm 4-5 times before she wakes up which really annoys me.

Changing my routine to getting up earlier is not possible, as i often finish my work shift at 21:00. I am unable to sleep in any other room than the one i made, as sound proof and as dark as possible. I can't sleep in a different bed ( we sleep in seperate beds, but in the same room ) I can't go to bed earlier some days and later some days, if i adjust my sleep routine i need to do it over the course of months, a few minutes a day..

I asked her if she could sleep in the guest room the 3 days that she gets up early, that was not an option as i already had the best bed and it would only be fair for me to sleep elsewhere since it's my problem, but i can't. I can't even go on holidays because of my sleep. The last one we went to i had to book a flight home 12 hours later after a sleepless night. I told her you either sleep elsewhere or I can't be with you, and she got super angry that she ment that little to me. I'm sorry but i need to prioritize my health.

TL:DR. I won't let girlfriend sleep in the same room as me, severe insomnia, she refuses to sleep in the guest room 3 days a week when she gets up 3 hours before me. I can't change my sleep routines/room no matter what.",0
"Alright I’m in the middle of a nasty inheritance war and I feel really bad about it. Firstly because a person I was close with once and was on decent terms with died. 


My ex husband recently passed away. We had two daughters together, Joycè (28F) and Bailey (25F). He also had a son John (17M), he and John’s mom weren’t married.


Joycè was very close with him. She’s a lawyer so she would be the one handling the whole situation legally.


Either way, by his will, the assets are divided this way. Joycè gets his property that they were renting out and the property they lived on, I think it’s worth about $200k+ combined. Bailey gets his SUV worth about $20k. John gets his classic car worth about $50k. Neither me nor John’s mom are listed as beneficiaries.


It’s understandable considering that both John and Bailey live pretty much across the country from Joycè. Not to mention that Joycè was his favorite kid, it’s how he openly put it multiple times.


Now Bailey is ultra pissed because she got the least valuable asset. John’s mom is pissed because she would have to maintain a classic car, gas insurance maintenance etc, the car is 50+ year old btw. Joycè is pretty much fine because she got the most valuable assets. 


John’s mom wants to sell his car, John says no. Bailey wants to trade her car for a piece of Joycè property. She and John’s mom founded a coalition against Joycè, basically what they want is to trade both cars for the property she rented out. Joycè said no way, in response she got in touch with John who’s really into classic cars and doesn’t want to get rid of the car of his dreams and got him on her side.


Everyone is pestering me because it’s a 2 v 2 situation and each side wants another unit on their team. I said no way I’m taking sides and engaging in a nasty inheritance war. I openly told Bailey that she’s going to fight against a very skilled lawyer and she’s going to waste more money than what she would gain, assuming she would gain anything, and probably destroy her relationship with her sister forever. Truth be told, I probably won’t last much longer, and one day the only other relative she would have would be Joycè. I also openly told Joycè the same thing and I added that it’s a low blow trying to get a kid on her side and sparking a feud between a kid and his mom just because she wants to keep her property intact. Now both sides say I’m the asshole just because I don’t want to be dragged into the conflict.",0
"My (19F) birthday is in a couple of days. I'm living very far from home due to university, so I'd just planned to spend it with friends; have lunch and then go do something fun.

Context 1: Last year my boyfriend (20M) planned a surprise party for me, but people had a hard time making it so it happened a few days after my actual birthday. That and some other circumstances surrounding the occasion resulted in a pretty bittersweet time for both of us (I was sad and he was sad because I was sad, basically). Because of that, this year I told him I didn't want a surprise. Besides, I struggle with anxiety, so I felt more calm knowing I could celebrate it in my own terms and not make a huge deal out of turning 20 if I didn't want to.

Context 2: My mom hasn't adapted too well to my moving away. My parents aren't together and live far from each other, so she was pretty much a single mom for most of my life. When I left, it hit her hard. That said, one of the reasons I did it was to create some distance between us. She can be intense, and I just needed some breathing room. This intensity was exacerbated by the fact that she's been missing me a lot, and has led to a couple of fights about boundaries and such.

I called my mom today and she revealed to me that she had been planning to come for my birthday as a surprise. She had planned to gift me a night at an expensive hotel, then spend the weekend. She said she realized it probably wasn't a great idea because I would want to spend it with my friends. I think the real reason is that she recently had to undergo surgery and traveling in that condition wouldn't be worth it (before you call me a horrible daughter, I went home, stayed every night at the hospital and after discharge I took care of her for two weeks).

Over Christmas she asked me for my bf's number and I gave it to her with his permission. Apparently, he had known about the surprise visit all along. I felt so blindsided. If you knew me, you'd know that that kind of stunt would not go well with me at all. In my shock, I didn't discuss the matter much with my mother, and called my boyfriend right after hanging up.

When I asked him why he hadn't told me, he got defensive. He said it wasn't his place to tell me and spoil the surprise, or to tell my mom that I probably wouldn't like it. I told him I knew that he hadn't meant to do me wrong, but that if the day had come and I just found my mother here, my plans made without asking me, with no warning whatsoever, I would've Actually Freaked tf out. I told him I felt betrayed that he would put my mother's desires before mine. He said he thought I would like it, and that he didn't like me telling him ""he had betrayed me"". Then he ""apologized"" saying he was sorry if I felt that way. By then I just felt sad and tired, so I asked him to talk later or tomorrow.

So, Am I The Asshole? Am I overreacting? Our relationship is wonderful, but I just feel so unknown all of a sudden, and it is an ugly feeling :(",0
"For context, I am a 31F living with my boyfriend ""Mike"" who is 34. Mike has a friend ""Victor"" who comes over a lot. Yesterday, Victor came over to watch baseball with Mike. Victor asked me to pass him a beer so I passed one over but I dropped it. It didn't crack open or anything, but he said ""Nice one, bitch."" I was honestly shocked and said excuse me? He started laughing and Mike joined in. I was very uncomfortable and genuinely didn't know what to say. I told Victor that I didn't appreciate him calling me a bitch. He got super defensive and said he was saying it ""jokingly"". I said it doesn't matter how you were trying to say it, I am uncomfortable. He got very huffy and said I was just being ""sensitive"" and then he said ""and you're probably going to accuse me of being a sexist now aren't you. Can't say anything these days."" This was wild because A) I didn't say anything about sexism and B) What do you mean ""can't say anything""? Can't call women ""bitches"" unsolicited anymore? What even was his point here?

Mike hadn't said anything during this interaction until I called him out. I asked why he wasn't defending me and he said ""idk babe you're being a bit dramatic."" At this point I'd had enough so I told them to leave and they went to Victor's to watch the game. Up until this point I thought I was in the right until Mike texted me angrily. He said I'd embarrassed him in front of a friend by being so melodramatic and SJW-y. He said Victor didn't mean any harm, and it was like how my friends call me bitch lovingly/jokingly. He also said it was uncalled for for me to kick him and Victor out of the house when Mike literally lives there. I said it's completely different because my friends make sure I'm okay with it and don't say it in a derogatory manner like Victor did. Plus, my friends are wonderful women who have supported me for years, not some friend of my boyfriend's who I barely know. And I was supposed to just let myself be disrespected in my own home? He called me annoying again and then turned notifications off.

He slept over last night (Victor lives alone) and hasn't come home yet. I think I might be the asshole because it's true that my friends call me bitch, and although it's different as I said above, it's possible that it confused Victor and made him think that was ok. I also didn't mean to make Victor uncomfortable/put him in the hot seat as a guest in my house. AITA?

EDIT: Accidentally referred to ""Victor"" as ""Lucas"" (these are fake names and I changed my mind halfway through making the post lol)

EDIT 2: oh my god. I was not expecting this to blow up like it did. I am so incredibly grateful for every single one of you who commented and I feel so supported. It’s impossible for me to respond to everyone but know that I’m reading your comments and I’m so thankful. I’m working things out right now, but I am safe, thank you so much for the concern. I’ll add a longer explanation and update later today when everything gets settled. A lot has happened since I made this post so I want to be able to update properly. Much love to you all, I am so overwhelmed with your kindness 💖

UPDATE: This will probably be my final update considering the thread is now locked (which is sad). Firstly, thank you all so, so much for all the support. It means so much to me. I'm so overwhelmed reading all the comments telling me that I deserve better, that I haven't wasted my time with Mike, that I'm worth more. It truly means the world. Also, thanks for all the lovely PMs I've been receiving. Reading these comments have made me realize that I'm still young and have my life ahead of me, and I am sure I don't want to spend it with a man like Mike especially after what happened today.

Today has been wild. To start, Mike didn't come home last night, meaning he has now spent two nights over there instead of confronting the issue like a mature adult. He didn't even text me to let me know that he was alive. So I texted him saying that I didn't appreciate at all what happened and that we should talk about it if there is any chance of saving this relationship. He sent me these wild paragraphs that basically said ""fine, leave me. good luck finding someone else who will want to fuck you, you'll never find another man because you're just another annoying crazy bitch, victor was right, you're a c*nt, etc."" He basically typed an entire essay, it was pretty funny but also disturbing. I couldn't believe a man I thought I loved was saying such nasty and disrespectful things to me. I texted back: ""lol alright. have fun calling me whatever the fuck you want with victor, i won't be around to take it. we're done."" His text truly was the last straw for me because he didn't apologize or even try to talk it out, he just immediately jumped to calling me names and saying really horrible things. I took my stuff (luckily it wasn't much to pack because all the furniture was Mike's) and drove to my sister's, where I'm currently living with her and her girlfriend. I hope I can find a permanent living arrangement soon.

Once again, thank you so much for all the support. I wouldn't have had the courage to end things without all the kind words and promises that things will get better, and that I deserve more than this. I was scared to leave because for some reason, people seem to think that women lose their ""value"" after turning 30. Looking back, Mike made this message clear to me as well during our relationship. I felt like I was undesirable because of my age and that I was lucky to even have a guy who could stand me. But reading your comments made me realize: I'm still young and there's plenty of time to find someone who will treat me right. Again, I am so incredibly grateful. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. 💜",0
"I was taking a long flight (8 hours) last week. I boarded the plane and took my seat, soon a woman came and took her seat next to me. Now I am all for body positivity (everyone is beautiful) and I do not mean any offense when I say this woman was extremely large. I’m quite a small person and I was a little nervous about sitting next to her but of course I didn’t want to assume anything negative and hoped for the best. As soon as she sat down I realized this arrangement wasn’t going to work. The seat clearly couldn’t accommodate her size and she was spilling out on both the aisle side and onto my seat. When the flight attendant asked us to put down our arm rests I literally couldn’t do it. The woman didn’t seem at all bothered by this. Immediately after take off she starts muttering about how warm she was and I quickly noticed she was becoming increasingly sweaty. Half her body was pressing into me and I could feel the sweat building up on the fabric of her clothes and where our arms were squished together. When the food trolley came around she moved even further into my space to make way and allow it to go down the aisle. Once it had passed us she didn’t move back. At this point I was incredibly claustrophobic and on the verge of a panic attack. I cannot stress enough how little of my own seat I was occupying. I tried to be polite when I asked her if there was any way she could give me a little bit more space as I am a little overwhelmed with the flight and how close together we were. She immediately grew defensive and told me I should have booked an extra seat if I wanted more space. At this point I was totally overwhelmed and starting to hyperventilate and still she wasn’t making any attempt to move. I looked at her and told her I didn’t need extra space- I only needed the entirety of the space that I paid for. She still didn’t get the hint and called me entitled and told me to take it up with the airline when we land and to suck it up “like the rest of us” until then. I didn’t know what to do, I couldn’t even get out of my seat to stretch because she was in the aisle seat and wouldn’t budge. Eventually I asked an air hostess if there were any other seats available, the woman immediately started crying and told the air hostess I had been body shaming her the whole flight. 
I felt terrible- I didn’t mean to cause offense and I really didn’t feel I had any choice but I definitely could have been more patient. 
AITA?",0
"I (58F) was married to a man for 16 years and we had a son. After my son was killed by a drunk driver we couldn't support each other. We divorced 6 years ago, I moved to a different state and we haven't spoken since then.

About a month ago I was contacted by the executor of his will and informed of his death. His latest will was written about a year ago.

When I went I was informed that he left me everything, except for $10k that he left to his girlfriend. They were together for 2 years and lived in the same house.

Now his girlfriend is demanding that I surrender all of the inheritance to her. She says that I wasn't the one that was there for him when he was drowning in his grief, that I moved on while he was still feeling guilt over the death of our son.

I have refused so far, but I still feel a bit guilty since I am planning to sell the house (our marital house, I couldn't bear to stay in it after our son's death) so she will have to look for housing (she can't afford to, she doesn't have a job). Also I make a good living and own a house outright (inherited from my parents).

So AITA?

Edit: since this seems like a frequent question: I offered her to stay at the house free of charge for the next 6 months before I put it on the market. Also I offered her her choice of whatever she wants to take from my ex's personal affects and house furniture she wants to take.

That and the continued use of the car.",0
"My boyfriend and I (both 28) have been together since we were 22, we broke up 18 months ago because I had to get back home (around 1-2hr drive) to help my dad take care of my mom, I told him that I wasn't in the right place to keep any kind of relationship and he respected my decision, a month after that my bf started to do quick trips to visit me, we didn't get back right away but we slept together continuously until I got pregnant.

My FIL has never liked me, he thinks that I'm a s\*lut for the way I dress and express myself, he's the kind of man that thinks that every woman who uses a single drop of make up is a w\*hore, yet, he has had multiple affairs. When he found out about my pregnancy he told my bf right in front of me that this wasn't his baby, he kept insisting with that until eventually he started to tell other people, neighbors, friends, co-workers, even strangers, that ''I fooled his son'' and that he was gonna raise another man's ''little shit''. He also congratulated me on making his son an idiot and didn't liked when I said ''your welcome''.

Obviously my boyfriend never believed that and neither did his mom or his brother, but his sister started to doubt, my FIL demanded a DNA test bus my boyfriend and I said no. He kept pestering us until my son was born, he didn't liked him at first of course, until one day he came all happy about ''his boy'' about ''his pride and baby'' and he, very confident, told my bf that he had him tested and that he was, indeed, his grandson. I kicked him out as soon as that came out of his mouth and when my SIL tried to defend him, I kicked her out too. 

We informed him that we wasn't allowed to see our son until we decided otherwise and my bf told my sil that until she apologized for believing their dad, she wasn't allowed either. My FIL is not happy of course and is demanding us to let him see my baby, so AITA?",0
"Hi guys. Okay so bit of context I need to add. My boyfriend is currently disabled, he’ll recover but as of right now he’s unable to walk and I need to be there to care for him 24/7. I don’t mind this at all and we’re doing pretty good all things considered.

I recently found out I’m pregnant and we decided we can’t keep it, I had to get an abortion and obviously that day I wasn’t able to care for my boyfriend so I asked my friend who works as a carer to step in and help for the day, for a generous price of course. She agreed.

Before I left I specifically told her a few things. One of which being under no circumstances can she leave her phone around him, reason being she has one of those flash things on it whenever she gets a notification and my boyfriend is currently at high risk of getting a seizure so nothing like that can be around him for the sake of his health. I asked her to disable it but she said there’s no need as it won’t even leave her pocket when he’s around. I left them to it and went to the clinic.

To make a long story short, she forgot her phone, it went off several times and my boyfriend had a seizure. Thankfully he was okay and he didn’t need to go to hospital but still, I’m furious about this, it was the ONE thing I asked her not to do and she risked his health because she forgot her stupid phone.

I pretty much told her to get out and she left without her money, I was already having an awful day as is and I came back to find paramedics with him so I was in no mood to debate anything with her.

My friend is really apologetic and clearly upset. She’s saying it was just an innocent mistake but I disagree, she didn’t mean to but it was her irresponsibility that caused this and this is supposed to be her JOB. She’s saying she needs the money, I believe her on that as she is really struggling financially but I just think it’s ridiculous to pay her given her “innocent mistake.” 

She’s been blowing up my phone saying the money I promised her is the difference between her making this months rent and not etc. I’m not budging but honestly, I do feel a bit harsh. Don’t get me wrong I’m furious and I don’t want to continue my friendship with her but I can’t help but feel like I may be being a tad too harsh here. AITA?",0
"This is a throw away for self explanatory reason. We moved into new neighborhood .My wife became BFFs with one of the neighbors. That women has a son and he clearly has some   mental problems .He barely can muster more then few words has anger issues and just screams for no reasons. He is about 5 years old. He was held back a year in kindergarten and kicked out from another due to behavior issues and inability to learn anything. We had a get together recently .The kid started breaking my daughters toys ripping books apart and other stuff. I went towards my wife and told that she should tell her friend to get her kid under  control. Next thing I know he took one of those children chairs and started charging towards the tv. I managed  to intercept before he could damage it. Later I found out before he wrecked 3 tv's this way. Once the party was over told my wife that kid is no longer welcome at my home. My daughter has even complained that he is very aggressive sometimes towards her and other people. My wife was a bit more on forgiving side, he is young, he needs some positivity .Yes, he has problems and so on. After the party my wife told be her friend broke down and started crying. I feel like shit but I know her refusal to do anything about the kid getting him diagnosed and medicated is one of the bigger problems here.So am in the wrong here ?

EDIT:Her situation is very dire apparently. Now I feel even more like an asshole. She did try to sort it but due to some legal bullshit and the medication being some sort of controlled substance .She needs an order from the court in order allow her child to be medicated. So its legal fees,lawyer and other expenses. Its to expensive to get him properly medicated.

EDIT 2:NVM found his mother just doesn’t care or not willing to put in the effort.Feel bad for the kid.Thank you all.",0
"I am STEAMING mad about this and everyone around me is pretending like I'm being a cunt. I'll let you people decide. First, I sew my own clothes. My husband and I live in a very nice house with a HUGE room filled with gorgeous sunlight for my hobbies.

We hosted Thanksgiving. My SIL and her three kids were staying with us, despite that she always treats me like shit for preferring pets over kids.

On Tuesday, as I went to do some last-minute shopping, my SIL texted about a tablecloth for her kids to put down while they did Christmas ornaments. I walked her through the closet with the VERY. CLEARLY. MARKED. TABLECLOTHS.

I got home 3 hours later and checked in on everyone. When I went into the hobby room where everyone was gathered, I saw it. SHE PULLED MY FUCKING ATELIER BRUNETTE FABRIC FROM THE CLOSET. MARKED. FABRIC. This particular style was discontinued several years ago, but I snagged for $25/yard. I had 6 yards. Let me note that fabric is EXPENSIVE and I have always sourced from thrift stores, deep clearance, etc. This was a GIFT to myself.

I fucking screamed ""What the hell are you doing?!"" and ran to the table. She looked alarmed and acted like she had no idea what she'd done. Her fucking kids spilled all kinds of paint all over the fabric. I told everyone to STOP, put DOWN the crafts, and get OUT.

After I fucking cried over that fabric and tried my best to salvage it, I demanded she replace it, and said how. She argued that she had no way of knowing that ""ugly ass"" fabric was for something other than a tablecloth, because it didn't look like anything anyone would ever wear seriously. I said I expected 6 yards.

Black Friday she and the girls handed me a JoAnn Fabric bag. They handed me 6 yards of an absolutely hideous Keepsake Calico fabric. Typically $9.99/yard but on sale for $3.99 this weekend.

I asked her if she was being serious, and she said yes, here's 6 yards of ugly ass fabric. I deadpanned ""Get the fuck out of my house. Now."" and she got very angry and started arguing with me that it's not her fault that I have expensive taste. I told her to leave, now, and not to come back unless she has EQUAL. QUALITY. FABRIC.

Of course I'm being told what an awful, evil person I am because I wouldn't ""graciously"" accept her insult of shit quality quilting cotton. For those who don't know fabric, this was like presenting someone with a 2001 Honda Civic after crashing their 2020 Maserati.

AITA?

**EDITED AT THE REQUEST OF A POSTER:**  To be very clear, SIL had to go *far* out of her way from where I directed her to grab the fabric. It was not even kept in the same room, let alone closet, as the tablecloths which were CLEARLY marked. There was no reason for her to be IN the fabric closet. The was not an ""honest mistake"" by ANY stretch of the phrase. When we were on the phone, I directed her SPECIFICALLY to the linen closet. She had to DELIBERATELY go OUT OF HER WAY to grab the fabric.

**SECOND EDIT:**  The linen closet is next to one of the bathrooms, where I directed her. Each shelf is labeled with what they're for, towels, guest towels, bed, guest bed, etc. I said ""You see the shelf marked tablecloths? There's one with paint on it. You can use that."" The fabric closet is in the master bedroom (NOT the craft room even), and each larger cut of fabric is kept inside of a plastic tub, often times in a vacuuum sealed bag, labeled with the yardage, manufacturer, and fiber content.

**THIRD EDIT:** Several people seem to have a personal issue with my writing style, use of caps, explanation of my large hobby room, etc! These aren't part of the issue, but seem to really upset some of you. I find that very interesting and wonder if it would be the same if it was a man describing his video game dungeon and battle station! I take a lot of pride in coming from a working class background and having a room dedicated to my hobbies. I hope you all get to enjoy a space of your own eventually as well. <3",0
"Throwaway because I don’t want this connected to my main. 

I (18F) dated my ex (18M) from sophomore to the end of junior year of high school. We broke up amicably, and both moved on. 

He dated more girls during the summer, while I remained single. We were still around each other a lot, because our circles of friends had blended, and our younger sisters were best friends. At the beginning of senior year, I still texted him from time to time because we shared a Government class and sometimes compared notes. But overall, we weren’t that close. 

Towards December, things with his girlfriend got rough and he began to lean on me like an emotional crutch, often asking me if I could come over so he could vent to me in person. Once, he asked me to go out to get dinner with him, and I declined, because I wanted to respect his girlfriend and because I was not his friend. He then decided it was a good time to tell me that he still loved me and wanted to get back together, because he could see himself marrying me and having kids one day. I was extremely creeped out because I was - and still am - a teenager who wasn’t even thinking about those things. I told him that I didn’t feel the same, and he did a complete 180. 

He called me a prude that was full of herself, and said that I should be careful because no one would want a girl with brains, and that he was my best option for a future. 

.... No. I ended up blocking him so I could spend the holidays in peace. I thought that everything would go back to normal, but once I returned to school, everything blew up. I noticed everyone was giving me odd looks, and was so confused until my friend pulled me aside and told me that my ex had decided to expose the ‘truth’ behind our breakup.

Basically, he told anyone who would listen that I was cheating and sleeping with others, and almost gave him an STD. To make things worse, he claimed that I had taken videos of it and shared it with him. Which is, needless to say, a federal crime. 

I was PISSED. One, I had never slept with anyone. He was the one trying to pressure me into that. Two, I come from a Catholic family, who would disown me if they even heard a rumor that I was having premarital relations. And three, I was being accused of a federal crime. 

I went straight to the Dean and told him everything. We attended a private school that didn’t take such things lightly, and I was assured that swift action would be taken. I left it at that, trusting that the school would do what they felt was right. 

Three months later, and I come to find out his admission to a top university along with his full ride scholarship for football had been rescinded. I was shocked when I was called to the Dean’s office and given a formal apology from my ex and his parents. 

At the time it felt right, but now, I feel like the punishment may have been too harsh, even if what he accused me of could have put me in jail. 

Am I the Asshole ?

———————-

EDIT 

Wow, hey y’all , I wasn’t expecting this to get so many comments. It popped up on my instagram explore page this morning and I was like “Whoa!” 

Anyways, I’d like to thank y’all for the feedback. There seemed to be some common questions and concerns so I decided to answer the ones I’ve seen the most. 

“How did a football player lose his scholarship over hurt feelings ?” I’m still really not sure how it reached the university, but it wasn’t just hurt feelings. I don’t think any good college would want someone who throws false accusations around. Also, he’s not even that good at football. 

“Why was your school so serious about it” I commented a few times but the school faced a lawsuit a few years before my time because they didn’t believe a girl who had almost been assaulted on campus. They got sued for emotional duress and criminal negligence (I think ?)  and I don’t believe they wanted a possible repeat. 

“You ruined his life over a rumor?” His life is definitely not ruined. My sister found out from his sister that he will be attending the top instate school, and he still has a girlfriend. He’ll be fine. 

“Why did you continue to text him?” I never initiated the conversations. We both took a government class that was mostly underclassmen, so he would reach out to me if he needed help. And I helped him, because at that time, he hadn’t been aggressive towards me. 


I hope this answered some of your questions y’all. I’ll still answer more if I come across them. Thank you for both the kind words and honest opinions. ❤️",0
"My brother is having a social event (don’t want to specify) and I ended up getting an invitation. I was pretty excited to get out of the house for the first time in awhile but he messaged me awhile ago asking me to not bring my caregiver because the event was for close relatives only. I didn’t raise a stink or anything I just messaged I couldn’t go if my caregiver wasn’t allowed. They give me my medicine and check on other health necessities that I can’t remember to do. This event is also predicted to last for hours so it’s not like I can just take my meds and vitals late. My family is getting mad at me saying I’ll be fine without them for awhile. They’ve never taken my illness seriously and tell me it’s all in my head (schizophrenia). I’ll elaborate further in comments if asked any questions.

Edit: just wanted to add the reason I’m so upset is I take things harder than others. I physically cannot handle people being mad at me. My family being upset with me has made my anxiety to act up ALOT. It causes me to be irrational that’s the reason I wanted to check with others that I wasn’t being mean.



Edit 2 (semi update??) :
it’s amazing to wake up to a lot of support, I mean when everyone in your life is telling you you’re horrible you start to believe it you know? I’m going to do what a lot of the comments say and look into group activities. This will be hard because I have an immediate “oh god I’m scared I want to go home and hide” every time I’m talking to new people. He’s very supportive of me getting out and going semi no contact. (Well he didn’t say it out loud but I could tell he was getting tired of my family. I can’t blame him for looking relieved) I’m really sorry please don’t be upsets with me I just can’t cut them off. I love them a lot and maybe after the distancing I’ll be more interested in completely no contact but for now. I’m only going to answer when they call and avoid their events. I’m also thinking of cutting financial support I was giving my brother because of this. I don’t want to hurt him and his wife though so I’m probably not going to.

((  Btw I’m also ignoring the messages and calls like you guys recommended. I couldn’t bring myself to block them though because I don’t want them to think I’m angry with them.   ))

((  Bttw thank you all for offering to talk with me privately for support! I really appreciate it but I’m not really comfortable. I always end up getting scared and suspicious of people I meet on the internet. (It’s stupid I know but a lot of my delusions are stupid) I hope all of you understand :)   ))",0
"I (31) and my husband, J (34) have a daughter, C (10 months). Since she was born my MIL has been on at me asking me when I’m going to have her ears pierced.

She says it’s hypocritical of me considering all the piercings I have (several piercings on both ears, plus my nose), but my own mother wouldn’t let me even get my earlobes pierced until I was 10. MIL had both SILs pierced when they were tiny, and she keeps going on about how “it’s better because they won’t remember it”. J says he supports whatever decision I make on the matter because I’m the one who would have to clean it (I stay home with C, J works full time).

So a few weeks ago, MIL was looking after C for us because I was going with J to his uncle’s funeral. As I was coming down the stairs I hear MIL talking to C about how “they’re going to go out shopping and get her some pretty earrings”. I went into the room and told her in no uncertain terms that that would not be happening, and if I can’t trust her to respect my decisions about my own daughter I would find someone else to look after her (I managed to get my sister to watch her).

MIL keeps trying to arrange to have her for a few hours, she even tried to offer to have her overnight so J and I can go out. I refused, I told MIL she could come and visit her, but I no longer trusted her not to get her ears pierced behind my back, so she would be seeing her unsupervised. J and my SILs think I’m overreacting, AITA here?

&#x200B;

Edit to answer some FAQ:

J and his sisters are in agreement that it's mine (and J's) decision, but they aren't siding with me on this because they don't believe their mother would go behind our backs like that. 

I haven't/don't plan on getting the police involved at the moment because I feel that would just cause a lot of problems and would cause more of MILs family to turn on me.

Piercings isn't a cultural thing for her, she's white British. I don't know why she's so intent on me doing it just because her own daughters' ears were done so young. She never forced piercings onto J, nor on any of her grandsons (C is her only granddaughter).

This isn't the only thing we disagree about, she's always telling me exactly what I'm doing ""wrong""....and not just me, she does it with J and his sisters too.

"My wife just gave birth to twins and haven't had a shower since, ever time I ask her to she gives some kind of excuse. Like I can't leave the babies or I'm just to tired. 

She never acted like this with our first child and even when I took time off work to help her she still refused, I can't understand why it, has gotten beyond frustrating and worrying.

Other things she usually looks after like dinner or cleaning the house haven't been looked after, I been doing as much as I can myself which is hard because I work full time, now those thing I can manage for the time being as I understand that it must take some time getting use to taking care of the new additions to our family. 

She is really starting to sink and it's hard for me when I sleep beside her during the night so during work I called her mom to see if she had any idea to help her daughter. Her mom give me a few ideas but didn't tell me she was gonna come over which she did. 

My mother in law went over to our house and basically forced my wife in the shower and refused to leave until she did shower. 

When I got home my wife was pissed off and told me she didn't need her mom involved and that she only needed my support during the hard time she's going through.

She been barely spoken to me ever since, I now feel as if I done something worng. 

Am I the asshole for telling my wife's mom?",0
"I have 3 children of my own and a 10 year old dog. Recently I added a 3 month old dog to the mix so we’re really working hard on building the puppy’s confidence. In my home my dog has always been taught proper interactions with children, no nipping, pulling clothing, chasing etc but I have also taught my children appropriate interactions with a dog. This includes common sense things like no pulling ears/tail or riding/sitting on the dog and more in depth boundaries such as you don’t touch the dog while it’s eating or sleeping, you never ride the dogs or enter the dogs crate for any reason. 
I babysit my nephew (2 yrs) a few times a week, he also has 3 dogs in the home, however my sister does NOT have the same boundaries and expects that her dogs are just “good dogs” and take the lip and tail pulling. My sister got mad at me this week because I disciplined my nephew for trying to ride my new puppy in front of her. I did it the same way I taught all 3 of my children, “ no thank you. We do not ride Aunty’s dogs” removed him and set him down a few feet away. Of course he’s 2, so he cried like I stole his ice cream and all I said was “that’s okay, you can be mad at aunty but you know the rules” and my sister came unhinged. Told me I need to train my dogs better if I can’t even trust them to not bite and that I was self righteous and that I was choosing my dogs over my own nephew. We got into an argument and I did say some things I shouldn’t have. After she said that she’d never bring my nephew back to my house, I told her that is was fine, I’d see her at his funeral when he was mauled by a dog or three. 
Am I really the asshole for expecting all children coming to my home to give my dog the same boundaries my own children have? 

I know I’m the asshole for what I said about my nephew.

Update: I just got off the phone with our mom. She’s siding with my sister, saying that even though we have different parenting views, it’s not my job to teach her child boundaries. I’ve explained that they were guests in my home and I wasn’t being unreasonable, I was asking for a level of respect and preventing a potential bite. I spoke at length about dog safety, child safety and that i won’t be a bystander when I see something unsafe involving children. She just doesn’t see it this way. If my dogs are dangerous I need to keep them tied up, and they both think this is an issue of over stepping parenting boundaries. I tried to parent her son when I had no right to.  My sister won’t answer my calls so I did send her a text apologizing for the comment I made, and asking her to have a conversation with me when we’re no longer heated so we can resolve it. 

I truly don’t think my mom and sister see this as the safety issue it is.",0
"I’m (25M) really upset about what she did. I needed to fly out from California to Washington because my dad had surgery from an accident and I wanted to be there to help out my stepmom with him for a few days. I was gone for a week and asked my sister if she could come over once a day to water my plants, check my mail.

 I also have (or had) 2 blue parakeets that I love. Male and female. The female was ready to lay her eggs so I already had a nest for them in their cage. Before my trip she was already sitting on her eggs in the nest and I told my sister to ALWAYS make sure to clean their cup of bird food and add more in everyday and keep their water clean. 

This was explained to her twice because I wanted to make sure the birds and the eggs would be okay. The male would be bringing food for the female to eat while she’s sitting on the eggs so that’s why I wanted to be sure she would follow what I said. Also clean out the tray in their cage. 

Everyday since leaving I asked her did the birds have food, was their water clean, etc. She told me yes, everytime so nothing to worry about. Finally got back last night. First thing was to check on my birds. Yeah the cage was clean and their water was too but guess what, all that was in their food cup was trash from the seeds they already ate. The mother bird was….you know. And obviously the eggs didn’t survive either. The only one that was still alive was the male but he looked so sad. 

First thing I noticed was that he was right on top of the nest box looking inside. Can’t tell you how much I was crying taking them out. She had 6 eggs and she died still trying to incubate their babies.

 My sister claimed their cup was always full so she assumed she didn’t need to put more food in. Despite telling her to refill their cup with MORE food. Because they had nothing. She keeps saying it was an honest mistake and she didn’t mean for them to die. And now I’m refusing to pay her the $200 I promised to drive here everyday because she didn’t follow everything instructed. She did everything else except this one thing so it’s not fair to refuse paying her. Calling me petty and shitty brother after doing me a favor for taking the time out of her days now only to not give her money she needs. 

I’m still really sad/angry about my birds so that’s why I feel like she doesn’t deserve anything for being the one responsible. But maybe I am? Or who knows. AITA?",0
"My parents believe in the freedom of choosing one's own religion. My mother was raised catholic, while my father believes in a god without participating in any church. I (14) honestly do not care too much about the topic. To the dismay of my aunt. During my childhood, she constantly tried to pressure my mother into getting me baptized. Whenever I visited them, she would try to push Christianity on me (she would read the bible to me and take me to her church - among other things). This made me very uncomfortable to the point where I did not want to visit anymore.

I recently developed an interest in herbs and plants. This somehow convinced her, that I practice witchery. Now she constantly switches between trying to ""save"" me and making a point of avoiding me. Most of the family thinks her silly - but like always, when she is acting crazy, everyone just accepts it. Since I did not budge, she focused on my brother (5).

He is friends with my cousin (6) and therefore spends a lot of time at their house. On his latest visit, my aunt decided to make an appointment with a priest, forge my mother's signature, and get my brother baptized.

After my brother told my mother about the incident (which my aunt told him not to do), she confronted my aunt on her next visit. My aunt proudly confessed to having ""saved"" my brother and a screaming match ensued. As I already mentioned, my parents strongly believe, that everyone should be able to choose their own beliefs and not join a church until one is old enough to make an informed decision.

To summarize my aunt's words: she could not believe that our mother was wilfully condemning us to hell and that it was no wonder I had become a satanic witch. She HAD TO act because my mother obviously couldn't be brought to her senses and someone had to save the boy.

In a moment of anger, I went to my room to get one of my pots (I have one pot in the shape of a skull) and filled it with water. While they were still screaming at each other, I poured the water over her. Then I declared her to be now baptized a witch and the lawful wife of Satan. I will be honest, I enjoyed the expressions of shock and then panic on her face. She told me to undo what I did. I refused.

Once she realized, she could not convince me, she stormed out of the house. Now, she told the whole family about it and my grandparents and other relatives have been bombarding my mother with hateful messages. My mother says she understands why I did what I did, but that I need to ""undo"" it to keep the peace. I am supposed to make a show of ""de-baptizing"" her and declaring her Christian again.I am just tired of everybody constantly talking about religions and fed up with my aunt and everybody's endurance of her. If she can just go around and baptize my brother, why can't I do the same to her?

AITA if I do not comply with my parent's wishes?  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
Edit:   

First of all: thank you for all the helpful replies and the awards. This got way more attention than I would have thought. I wanted to give an update to the whole thing:   
 Apparently, neither the baptism of my brother, nor the priest itself were legitimate. The dude is not even registered as a priest and is  just someone she found online. He, with my aunt, and my grandmother held a small unofficial ceremony. My grandmother confessed this to my grandfather once the drama started and he now told my mother. The whole thing is rather weird and my grandfather told my mother to report the “priest”, but my mother just wants to leave the whole story behind us. Since his baptism does not have any real effect on my brother, she sees this as an easy solution to get her sister of her back. We are just happy my brother is not actually baptized. Also, good news is, my mother no longer wants me to “de-baptize” my aunt and finally accepted that she is simply crazy. She will try to talk with my grandmother tomorrow, since she is not as crazy as my aunt and can hopefully convince her of leaving me alone. According to my grandfather, my aunt told the story of me baptizing her very different, which is why my relatives were on her side. 

Despite all the hilarious suggestions on how I could continue to scare my aunt, I will not do anything like that. I will just wait and see how things go from here ",0
"On mobile so formatting might suck, sorry! 

So my friends and I are going on a trip next month to Miami, FL. We’ve been planning it for about a month now, and originally it was going to be a float trip within our state and with 16 people we go to college with (before everyone screeches about the pandemic, we’re all fully vaccinated through our uni). 

One of my friends in particular (J) has a very specific work schedule. We worked around this and got days of the week that are less convenient for the majority because we wanted to include her. She refuses to take off work for the trip despite going on multiple week-long vacations with other people since April. Still though, we did our best to accommodate her. 

On New Years, we all stayed on campus for the break so her, myself, two friends, and my boyfriend (A) all spent the night together drinking and playing games in my apartment since my roommate had gone home. That night, she made a passing comment about how she thought my boyfriend was hot and she would love him to be her New Years kiss, and I chalked it up to drunken confessions and ignored it since she didn’t make any moves. At one point she did “fall” into his lap but he removed her quickly.

Now for this trip, we had to seek out accommodations. After changing from the initial float trip because I and our other friend (S) wanted to go to Florida, we downsized our group to just me, S, J, A, and A’s friend. We were looking at a 3 bedroom apartment on AirBnB with enough beds to have everyone sleeping comfortably. While discussing sleeping arrangements with S and J, J decided to half joke about how she wanted to sleep with A and that I wouldn’t be mad since we’ve gone on breaks to see other people before. (Note, A and I have been dating for 3 years at this point. We’ve “broken up” to see other people once before in our first year when we went on summer break because our hometowns are too far away to see each other. We were 18/19 at the time and haven’t done it again since)

I expressed discomfort at this joke and she kept brushing it off but I really don’t trust her. While talking with S privately, she also said that it was a bit weird. I ended up shifting the dates of our stay and place tickets by one day which would prevent J from being able to attend due to her work schedule. At first I just said it was because those were cheaper dates, but she seemed to pick up immediate that it was done because of what she said. 

She’s now calling me a manipulative bitch and cursing me to hell. S said it was a bit unexpected but she understands why I did it as well as why J is mad. A has no idea because we haven’t involved him in the situation. He just knows the new dates and is fine with them.

"[*Updated*]

So I told my mother that her multi-level marketing business is basically a scam. She’s been in this business for about a couple of weeks and she’s been watching these videos and webinars about how people can also become millionaires just by joining their MLM business, showcasing their lavish lifestyle and perks in joining the company. Well after telling her it was a scam; moments later I had to say sorry because she was crying and apparently it hurt her feelings that I said that her business was a scam. She said that I didn’t believe in her enough and that it hurts her to see that her son thinks that she’s scamming other people. I felt bad that I hurt her feelings and made her cry because I wasn’t thinking of her efforts but I still think its a scam.

Edit: I (18M) and my mother (36F)

*UPDATE*: First of all thank you  for all of the advices, sources, and worries from all of you. I appreciate them all. So here’s what happened after confronting my mother again about this issue. 

*Full Disclosure*: I am bad at arguments. I get anxiety just by having disagreements especially with people I care. My mind also goes blank when I’m getting screamed at during any disagreement, so it was very hard to confront her in a more serious way.

We discussed first why it’s a scam and why most people who are involved in an MLM lose money and even go in debt. I couldn’t say anything that could persuade her because she’s defending the company with so much emotion to the point that she would raise her voice. She really believes that with hard work she could actually make it because she believes on the product too much. The products of the company are health supplements (like vitamins) and she believes that those supplements are needed specifically the supplement that contains vitamin D3. She says that doctors prescribes patients vitamin D3 (no specific brand). She’s coming off that there will be always someone who’s gonna buy her supplements. Her reason why she went into the MLM business is because she wanted a discounted price on the supplement that she is currently selling. She says It’s not a scam and is a legitimate business because the money you give to the MLM business gets converted into products/goods the she could sell or use for her self. I told her that MLM businesses are a harsh competition that most people don’t get a ROI but she was adamant that by hard work, she could really be successful. 


After a while, my step dad (36M) stepped in because he saw that my mom was getting to aggressive (like shouting) so he was the one who tried to explain that the MLM business that my mom got involved, wasn’t a scam. At first he asked me if I was willing to listen to him which I answered yes *if* he would watch some videos about the bad sides of MLM’s ( because at this point I couldn’t get my argument straight ). He said that the top people  get their income through sales but in order to get sales they need a lot of people to become distributors, so they incentivize people if they could refer more people to sell the products. To me it looked legitimate because he tried to make an analogy that if MLM’s are a scam. Does that mean people who sell land are scams? Does that mean franchises are scams? I tried to counter that argument by saying; “But these types of things don’t focus on referrals but solely focuses on sales” but in the end I couldn’t persuade him that his analogies and MLM are very different from one another. He say’s that he sees my point of view because when he was young he also thought of MLM’s are scams but when he grew a bit more older and learned that not all MLM’s are bad. He says the reason why he wouldn’t join my mother because he couldn’t handle the hard work you need to put in and the constant rejection from people. He says that I’m still naive and don’t know how the whole thing works. He says that “yes, it is hard for the people below because the amount of people to recruit becomes scarce but there are other ways to earn like selling the product.” ( paraphrased )Which I don’t quite understand because in my eyes, MLM businesses especially distributors only get rich through referrals. He really pushed the fact that the MLM is not a scam and it shouldn’t be seen as a scam because if it was, the owner should’ve been arrested a long time ago and no MLM businesses should be operating. He also said that I don’t know much and he knows more because he’s existed much more longer than me. What annoyed me but made me not care a bit was that he said he won’t watch the videos even though he said he was open to them. At that point I was done arguing and I was mentally drained. I couldn’t think clearly and was having a headache. Lastly he said that instead of dragging her down, we should support our mom as a family by helping her or just by not dragging her down. He says that if she thinks she can be successful then we should just let her be. In the end all I could say was that I was just looking out for her and didn’t want her to get disappointed if she fails and to get into debt. I failed to persuade him and my mom because to them the business plan of the MLM was “legit” and because they had past experiences about MLM businesses (which I had no clue that my mom was involved before) that she joined; which makes them believe that the MLM business that my mom is currently involved in feel legitimate.

I’m sorry that I couldn’t persuade her but I still took the courage and tried my best. At this point, I don’t know how to stop her because I don’t really have anyone who would side with me. I’ll just look out for my mom if she would consider making financial decisions that could affect me and my family.

"I (16m) have been dating my girlfriend (16f) for ~1 year. Recently my family had a dinner planned so I decided this was a good time to introduce them. At the dinner my mom dropped some steak, she then said it's fine and the dogs'll clean it up for her.

Now as some background me and my mom have this inside joke of calling each other horrible people over meaningless things. For example, not putting a shopping cart back in its area, leaving bread in the candy aisle, etc.

My mom laughed but my girlfriend got really upset at this since she unfortunately lost her mom half a year ago.

She said it was unfair of me to call my mom horrible as she does a lot for me and I will regret calling her this when she passes. My mom told her it was okay and it was an inside joke. Things quieted down after my mom said it was okay, but it's been 2 hours after the dinner and my girlfriend is still mad at me.

So am I the asshole? ",0
"I (16f) have a twin brother (Cody). 

I do cheer and Cody does sports. We do these activities because we enjoy them but Cody also puts in a lot of effort because he’s constantly seeking approval from our dad AND step dad.

The two don’t care for each other, but are somehow the best of friends when it comes to Cody’s sports.

He does like 5 different ones because our dad likes hockey and lacrosse while our step dad prefers football and basketball-they both enjoy baseball. If he ever dares to quit a single one, one of them will throw a riot or accuse him of playing favourites.

It’s so dumb. Sometimes Cody’s schedules clash or get so overwhelming to the point where he’ll lay on his bedroom floor for hours and dissociate. It’s been like this since he was like 10. 

My mom and step mom think it’s just men being men and that boys enjoy sports so Cody probably doesn’t care but like there’s a limit to everything right? 

We were having a celebratory lunch for our older sister before she leaves for college and both sides were there. The lunch ended at 2pm and our sister asked if we wanted to go the mall. I said yes and Cody was CLEARLY going to say yes but our dad said he had baseball practice. 

Cody tried asking if he could sit out one day since he hasn’t missed a single practice of anything in his life but our step dad joined our dad‘s “practice makes perfect” speech and backed out. They then tried using ME as an example. 

“Oh Ashley’s never missed a day of practice and look at her! Medals and trophies for days!” 

I thought this was ridiculous. I’ve missed plenty of practices and Cody has more awards than me. 

I asked them if they were being serious and told them what I just mentioned. My dad kept telling me to be quiet but I called him and my step dad losers that need to realize that Cody is a human being with limits, not a doll they can program or play with.

Both of them were very embarrassed. My dad told me that I was being very disrespectful. My mom joined in and said I was reading too much into the whole thing and that they’re men and I simply won’t get their dynamics. I call bullshit but they’re all saying I’m in the wrong and need to apologize. My sister agrees with me but says I was disrespectful. Cody doesn’t wanna talk about it. AITA?

Just to make it clear, the practice was an informal one. Think of it as extra credit/to strengthen specific skills.",0
"Every year, my spouse's family holds both a christmas eve dinner and a christmas morning breakfast. For many years before we had kids, my spouse and I attended both events. We have young kids now so I am refusing to do both (but will do one) for a few reasons:

&#x200B;

* This is a very stressful time of year and doing back-to-back events adds exponentially more stress since my spouse takes these events very seriously in terms of how they and the kids are dressed, , the food they bring, etc. Everything has to be perfect and it brings an incredibly negative energy into the house, particularly since my spouse does not handle stress well and lashes out at me and the kids when they think I am not helping enough, the kids are misbehaving, etc.
* It makes it so our immediate family (my spouse, our kids, and myself) doesn't have our own traditions and identity since all the traditions and activities revolve around my in-laws and what they do.
* My spouse's entire family gets together virtually every week for dinner already and we go at least twice a month. We see them plenty, and every time we do we stay far later than agreed and the kids get to bed extremely late, which has a ripple effect for days afterwards. We also see them for every major holiday, including Thanksgiving and Christmas breakfast.
* I plain don't think it's fair for my spouse's family to expect us to spend that much time with them over the holiday.

My spouse is really upset that we are not going to the Christmas Eve dinner this year. I told my spouse that they are welcome to go if they want to, but the kids and I are staying home to have dinner, watch a christmas movie, and open pajamas. My spouse's family thinks I am being a controlling monster for refusing to go.

For context, we see my family probably 6 times a year (including Thanksgiving, which we plan around my spouse's family, and christmas dinner).

"So background: I (32f) have a brother, ""Dave"" (35m), who's married to ""Sarah"" (29f). They don't have children yet. I have a son who just turned four and a three-month-old daughter with my husband (39m). My husband and I live in Belgium most of the time, but we travel back to visit my family about once a month (in England). At home, we speak both English and French to our children (my husband is Belgian), and right now, my son is in this very sweet phase where he'll sometimes mix up the two languages and say a couple of words in English in a French sentence or vice-versa. This has never posed a problem to us, and even the staff at his nursery have reassured us that it's very common and they tend to grow out of it once they start at school.

My sister-in-law has decided that this is a problem, so when we're visiting my parents and she notices my son doing this, she'll correct him, but she does so really rudely, whereas my husband and I will just gently correct him.

Anyway, we're visiting at the moment and she's now decided that instead of correcting him, she's just going to start ignoring him when he does this. I sort of noticed her doing it when we arrived, and I thought it was odd, but assumed maybe she was just stressed (her job is quite intense), but it only really became an issue yesterday. My husband was talking to my dad outside and I was feeding my daughter in the other room, and I'd left Louis with Sarah and Dave. When I came back downstairs, Louis was crying, and I managed to understand that he'd tried to ask Sarah for a drink (he has a special cup he uses that he was holding, so it was obvious what he meant) but that she'd just ignored him. I asked her why and she explained that she wasn't going to reply to him unless he said the sentence correctly and that I shouldn't be ""ignoring my son's obvious speech issues."" For context, it's not that she didn't know what he wanted. She told me that she understood exactly what he was asking for, but that she was deliberately refusing because he hadn't asked correctly.

This really pissed me off, but luckily my husband came inside at that moment and pulled me away so we could calm down and settle Louis. That night at the dinner table, Sarah asked me to pass her something, but she said it in ""bad"" English (she IS English, I just mean that she asked for it in slang. Think, ""Pass *us* the peas, will you"". I had a bit of an epiphany and I just decided to totally ignore her. She asked again, and I did the same thing. My brother asked why I was ignoring his wife and I said that I'm not able to reply if she can't speak English correctly and that it's wrong of him to ignore her obvious issues with grammar.

Everyone's pretty pissed off with me and I admit it was incredibly childish, but she was needlessly being a dickhead to my baby.

Should I just apologise?

**Edit: WOW this really blew up. Thanks for all the comments and support, and thanks for all the ESH/YTA messages too. I'm not going to apologise to her, because, to be quite frank, I think she deserved it, but I will have a conversation with her and my brother before we leave to try and explain that, for one thing, it's completely normal, and, more importantly, that if she keeps correcting or ignoring my son, I'll be severely limiting their contact. Although I doubt if I'll ever leave him alone in a room with her again anyway.**

**To answer a few of the most common questions: When I said everyone was mad at me, I meant my brother, his wife and my parents (although, my parents don't agree with what Sarah's doing either. They're more trying to ""keep the peace""). My husband is entirely on my side, and when he realised what Sarah had done to Louis (he only saw the aftermath), he wanted to cut short the trip.**

**Sarah (and the rest of my family), only speak English, which I suppose goes some way towards explaining why she doesn't understand it. I do think it's a monolingual reaction because we've never experienced anything similar in Belgium.**

**One final thing - lots of questions about why we're in the UK so often. My husband has to be in London for his job about once a month/ once every six weeks, so we tag along. I freelance, and a few of my clients are UK based, so it's a good opportunity for me to fit in a few meetings too. It also gives us the chance to bring Louis and Misha over to see my parents before Louis starts school, and we have to cut down on the visits.**",0
"This is a throwaway acct. My (42F) brother (40M) is an incredible person who is quickly approaching his rock bottom. He is bipolar (diagnosed in middle school and on meds) and is prone to deep swings of depression with sprinkles of manic upswings that are only brought on by “good things” happening— usually when he comes into money or when he meets a new girl. 

He is recently homeless because he just decided to stop paying rent and bills and instead spend money on “what makes him happy” which is being social, drinking, weed/coke, and trying to meet girls. He’s a sweet guy, but he has zero direction and a dead end job that is weather-dependent so he doesn’t make a sustainable income. He is currently living in his car with his dog or crashing on couches. He has no savings and any encouragement or offer to help him get on a path to being a functioning adult falls on deaf ears or is met with “it won’t work”, “I can’t do that”, etc. This is how it has been with him for 20 years, with short-lived phases of success, followed by a sharp decline because he doesn’t ever plan ahead and he sets himself up for failure

He needs more help that I or my family can offer. He often talks about not wanting to live, he looks like shit, and has recently mentioned that he’s been doing drugs that are laced with Fentanyl. I feel like the only thing that can turn his life around is to spend 3+ months in a program where he can get daily help and guidance, not only for substance abuse, but for his mental health issues, and to help him learn how to rebuild his life and learn how to be a functioning adult. 

Here’s the $$ part: My family doesn’t have loads of money and rehabs are very costly. Sadly, a great uncle just passed and he was very wealthy and very generous. He used to gift all the “kids” in the family (my brother and I included) $10,000 every few years. I would save, invest, or spend mine on things like CC bills, etc. My brother has always spent his in literal days on a giant TV, a motorcycle, buying rounds of drinks for the whole bar, expensive shoes, drugs, gifts for girls, etc…All things that are instant gratification— he rides that high for a week or so, and then crashes hard back to reality. He’s always had to sell off the TVs, the motorcycle, etc to scrape by.

Since our uncle passed, I’ve been told that we will be getting a significant amount of money. My brother has not been told anything about it. My parents and I think that this windfall would best be used to pay to send my brother somewhere to get better, to reset his life, etc. 

If this works, even if he goes and gets better and comes out with a better grasp and mental vision on life…I know that he will be incredibly angry that we spent his inheritance on sending him to a program. 

My heart is so broken and I’m afraid he won’t last through the year. I’d love to hear any thoughts, opinions, etc. Thanks for reading, please be kind, this is not an easy thing to go through.",0
"Me (31 F) & my husband (34 M) have been together 10 years.

My MIL & FIL are big on holidays, but there are only 5 people there: M/FIL, BIL, husband, & me.

My husband & his brother have toxic relationship. My BIL (38 M) is 2x divorced, a drunk, and gets verbally abusive when drunk.
I don’t tolerate it well. I have 3 brothers; we went through hell growing up. Our bond is strong & there’s love/respect .

My husband & BIL have vicious fights. 90% of them are drunken phone calls at night. When my BIL is drunk, I try to get my husband off the phone but sometimes end up mediating. BIL thinks I make more sense than my husband when he’s drunk - I have an extensive family history of addiction. At the end of the calls, I feel triggered. 

I have PTSD. My triggers are mine, but over the years I have this mental list of horrible things he’s said to me/husband. 

Told us we are f’ed up because we take meds/go to therapy, me I have daddy issues, and my husband that he’s better in every way on our anniversary. 

My husband doesn’t want to cut him off; I did months ago. The ILs enable BIL; say he’s not the problem when his wives leave him. BIL was VERY upset over 2nd divorce, so we all put time into helping him start over the past 2 years. I even spent hours on the phone w/ him while he sobbed & wished things were different. 

September: my husband & I went through a ROUGH patch. So bad I moved in with my brother & SIL for a month. When I was gone, my husband got unwanted advice from his brother. Said to be as cruel as he can to me, change banks b/c I work for the bank (financial crimes unit!) & will go through his accounts. My M&FIL encouraged this too. Like none of them have known me for the past 10 years, questioning my morals/love.  

October: my husband & I worked it out. My husband gets a text from BIL saying “I’m alive just in case you were wondering” husband responds “sorry been busy with work, life, & wife.” BIL says was “just remember who was there for you when your ‘wife’ was gone for a month.”

This is the 1st time in 10 years that I decided that I want like to spend Thanksgiving with just my husband, MIL & FIL on Black Friday. Said I can even bring pizza if they don’t want to fool with leftovers. This upset ILs, all of them. MIL says “we just won’t have Thanksgiving at all if you 2 aren’t coming”. BIL texts husband saying “yall are punishing the parents”.

Today: MIL told my husband that they weren’t sure if my BIL would be at the house Friday. The plans were made a month in advance. I didn’t want to blindside them.

I’m on Wellbutrin & Klonopin. In therapy. We’re in marriage counseling. We’re trying. 

I still feel like crap. I feel selfish. Swallowed by guilt. Like I’m tearing apart a family. Like I’m the problem & my ILs all feel that way too. 

I also feel they want to force a relationship & disregard our feelings. I’m trying to keep our peace. I’m tired of putting everyone else’s homes 1st. I don’t want to be around my BIL ever again. AITA?",0
"For the past few months (I don’t know exactly when it started tbh but at least since November) my next door neighbor has been extremely loud. Yelling, shouting, groaning, banging on things to the point I genuinely considered he was building something a few nights ago. This continues on throughout the day on many days, but it’s especially a problem at night. It’s almost midnight here and it’s still going, with him seemingly arguing with someone. The other night I woke up at like 1 to him shouting over and over “get out.” This has gone on until 3am some days in the past few weeks.

I tried talking to my leasing office about it this past week and they said they’d see what they can do, but they said there’s only so much they can do and that if the problem persists, that I might have better luck contacting the police and making a noise complaint.

I’m a very nonconfrontational person, and tbh the way he yells can get kinda scary, so there’s no way in hell I’m going over there to talk to him about it, and I’m pretty sure the apartment next to him is vacant so other than our downstairs neighbors, it’ll be pretty clear it’s me if I left a note or something. So… genuinely considering calling the police if this continues through the end of this week. Although I am also a little worried that this guy could potentially have mental health problems and I don’t want to cause problems for them with the police? But I need my fuckin sleep man and my patience is running super thin.

So — WIBTA?

"My husband and I got our oldest son (16) a dog for his most recent birthday. He is a very sweet rescue with a good temperament, and our son has been doing a great job training him. He is very friendly and loves to lick to show affection, which all the kids like. My husband hates it though and always tells the kids not to let the dog lick them.

This morning the dog went up to our four year old, and our four year old was petting him. The dog licked his cheek, and our four year old then kissed him on the nose. It was so adorable, and I took a video of it. I sent the video to my sister and sister in law. My sister thought it was cute, but my sister in law said that was absolutely disgusting.

My husband texted me and said not to let the dog lick our four year old and definitely not to let our four year old kiss him, because it's absolutely disgusting. I said it was just a cute bonding moment between the two of them. He said he didn't care, and it needs to not happen. I said I have a lot of work to do today, there is laundry, dishes and floors to do, and I can't watch the dog 24/7 to make sure he doesn't lick our baby. He said to lock him in our oldest's room then. I said no.

He asked me why I am being difficult just to be difficult. I said he's being over the top with the germaphobia. I got licked by dogs as a baby, and it never did me any harm. He's really upset, so I wonder if I'm being an asshole. I know he is afraid of germs, so maybe I should be more accommodating?",0
"I, (16f) have parents that live in two different houses as they are divorced. One lives quite far away from everything I need to be close to, whereas the other lives close.
For a while I had been considering and able to decide if I wanted to stay permanently at one parents house or the other, for a few reasons.
I chose yesterday to break the news to my father and my stepmum that for my work and my education I would be permanently based at my mother’s house, and would just visit them. (mum’s is closer to my workplace, friends, course, and has a couple financial reasons + I will feel more stable only living at one house) and they responded with saying things like “What about what we’ve done for you?” and “This feels like a kick in the guts?” however I assumed this choice would be more beneficial for both me and them, as nobody would have to work around their schedule to take me places. 
I feel like an asshole for doing this because I know they have done a lot for me, and I acknowledged this when informing them. My step-siblings (I only have siblings on my dads side) are upset but I can visit them if they want. 
Am I the asshole? ",0
" i recently had a dream the other night where my fiancé cheated on me so i went through his phone the next night because i was overthinking about the dream.

i then find his ex’s name in his messages and the last text he sent her was “hey” back in june and i scrolled up to find out that he texted her i miss you three days (April 18th)  after our three month anniversary of being engaged.

this hasn’t been the only thing with his ex though. apparently she still has a great relationship with his mom. his mom even considers her a daughter and his ex calls her mom. he didn’t tell me for almost two months that he was in a group chat with her and another one of his friends. in other messages he made a pact with her and “jokingly” texted her that master is getting angry when she wasn’t replying back fast enough and even sent her pictures of him shirtless.

i don’t know the full background of their relationship but apparently it only lasted for two months back in 2021 and i’m assuming a lot more happened than what he’s told me. 
update: he told me that she cheated on him a bunch of times and was very narcissistic and finally dumped her when she cheated on him for the last time.

i keep asking him why he even texted her and he keeps saying he doesn’t know but you can’t tell someone those words and not mean them. i feel like an idiot and so dumb for not finding these texts sooner.

edit: i know it’s weird to check his phone over a stupid dream. trust me and i don’t even know why i had the dream in the first place when everything was going well in our relationship. it’s very rare for me to have dreams like that when i normally have nightmares or plain out don’t dream at all. 

recent update: finally confessed to cheating on me right after we got engaged 🙃 so it’s now officially over between us",0
"Long story short; we have had a real streak of bad luck. Our car died, the heating broke in the house, my partner (in the space of this week) lost his godfather, his aunt and his uncle.

My brothers baby was born on the 9th in another town 11 miles away. (We have no car, remember). He was off work all week and (god knows when because nobody told me) came back to our current town. I wasn’t off work. For two nights I’ve had to wait for the guy to come diagnose the heating issue.

I’ve been desperately trying to be supportive of my partner, run the house and try to find solutions to all the problems. I suffer with bipolar disorder, so it’s hard enough without the added crap.

My family seems to disregard our situation to focus on ‘chin up go see the baby’. Ive explained I’m not in the right headspace, I can’t bring myself to do it. My mother even said “We’ll, you’ve got your niece to look forward to now” after his godfather died. Me and my partner grew close to him.

They never once contacted him to say their condolences, never offered to come see us yet they expect us to bend over backwards and disregard the grief we’re going through in favour of my brother and his baby.

They make me feel like I’m an asshole, with my mother kindly saying over text “just asking you to think about your family also”. The exact thing I feel none of them have done for us.

So, am I the asshole here?

[EDIT]
Thank you for the replies and input, I really appreciate it.

I’ve decided that it would be best to distance myself from them all. I recall an incident where my mum turned me against my eldest brother for coming out as gender confused. She is very manipulative and not empathetic to anyone.
I even asked my step father if I was being unreasonable for not immediately going because of the situation and got a ‘Yes’. 
Screw em.",0
"I (M 33) was best friends with R (F 33) for 10 years and although we had many common interests and hobbies, our personalities clashed often. She was a great person to be around but she was also very jealous and insecure. 

The main issue we would argue about was her attempts at telling me who I could and couldn't be friends with and this was also a rule she attempted to make when it came to relationships I was in. 

One night while we were out with friends, R pulled me aside and demanded I break off any relationship I was in at that moment (I wasn't in one) and stated she would need to approve of anyone going forward. She also tried to downplay personal issues I was going through at the time and stated those didn't need as much attention as I thought. I left and she sent texts all that night restating everything she said. R never apologized for what she said and I cut her off. 

This past week, a mutual friend of ours told me R's jealousy has caused most of our mutual friends to keep their distance and she wants to apologize starting with me. I refuse to hear her out because it doesn't seem like she's changed and I'm also in a happy and healthy relationship which R has a history of having problems with. This friend has stated that by not accepting her apology, I'll be ensuring R is left as an outcast to our other mutual friends. So AITA?",0
"Edit 5 the next night: Thank you everybody who sided with me. I'm glad to know I was right. To those who claim I have a problem with being black, lack empathy, etc, none of those things are true. And no, she had never met my family members until that night, and she had never seen any pictures of them. I have a flip phone and have never used social media, and neither have my relatives, so there aren't really any photos to go around. Even if my friend had asked to see a photo of my family, I'd have literally nothing to show her.

As expected, my family and my friend are aware of this post. They want it to be taken down and feel it's a massive violation of trust that I've made a few posts of them here. Nonetheless, they're only listening to the very few comments siding with them. Ultimately, my friend has decided to go NC with me because she feels she doesn't know anything about me despite sharing a lot about herself. I feel you can't really please everybody, and even if you're a kind person who does everything right, you'll always have somebody who takes issue with you for whatever random reason. I wish her luck in her future endeavors.

Edit 4: I'll be heading out now to catch up on a series I read. Thank you everybody for your judgements, aside from the weirdo who said I should call everybody the N word. I'm not sure why that pointless comment is still there.

Edit 3: My family has asked me to take down this post, and they say they're upset that I didn't tell them I have autism. However, I'm getting very insightful responses so I'll be keeping this post up. I do agree with the vast majority of comments that I'm not particularly obligated to tell anybody anything about me no matter how close I feel to them. However, it's not something I do on purpose. I just don't think to tell people things sometimes.

Edit 2: Thank you everybody for your responses. Somebody asked if I have autism. I do, but it's not something I particularly advertise. If my family asked if I had autism, I'd say yes. If my friend asked if I was black, I'd say yes. I can understand her being surprised about my background since I have absolutely no black features despite my DNA test saying I'm about 40% African with the rest being white and a smidge of indigenous.

Edit: My brother found this somehow and had this to say: ""It doesn't matter how AITA feels. They don't know you like we do. You have a big problem with communication and if everybody in the real world thinks you're in the wrong, it's because you are. Reddit isn't real life.""

I (25M) am biracial but pass for white. I have pale skin, B1 dirty blond hair, and overall, don't look black at all. I've never spoken about being biracial because it never occurred to me that I need to. It's not something I ever think about.

However, in the 9th grade, I made a black friend. We'd always been very close, but I never talked about my background or anything because it, again, didn't occur to me to. So she'd never been over to my house or anything. She was back in town, so I invited her over to catch up. She got along great with my family, but also took me aside and tell me she didn't ""see that coming."" I asked her what she meant, and she said she didn't know I was black. I told her I didn't really think to tell her in advance that I'm black, and she said, ""I mean, it's kind of a weird thing to not tell your best friend."" I told her that I just don't tell people a lot of things in general, and she said she'd like if I opened up about myself more and that I could trust her. I said, once again, that I just didn't think to tell anybody. She said goodbye to all of us, and I asked my family who was in the wrong. They all sided with her, and said that if I consider her my best friend, I need to tell her these things.

AITA? I'm an INTJ so I tend to not really talk about myself. I'm not ashamed to be black; I just don't see the point in talking about my genetics to random people.",0
"My daughter has two of my grandchildren and she lives in Napa. Last summer she invited me to spend part of my summer vacation at her home. I thought it would be great. Spend time with the family, your some vineyards, buy some wine for the new school year. I was all for it. 

The reality was different though. She would leave me at home to spend time with the kids so she could go run errands. Twice she went out for dinner with her husband while I stayed at the house. I told her clearly that I wasn't happy with the situation and she got huffy and said that I had taken a year off work to help my son take care of his son. 

This is absolutely true. I did that. I took a sabbatical to help my son who's wife was crippled in a car accident and was in rehab for a fucking year learning how to use her body again. I didn't say anything but the audacity was too much. 

When my daughter invited me out for this summer I politely declined and said that I had plans. She asked what I was doing and I truthfully told her that my boyfriend and I were spending the summer fixing up the house and camping. She said that Napa is more fun and that the kids want to see me. I said I had a week free in August that she could visit me in Spokane. She didn't like that idea. Now she isn't talking to me and I'm okay with it. I'm currently drinking my morning wine and watching my boy toy powerwash the deck.

"I (21F) bought my little sister (16F) foundation a few days ago. My sister (Alya) has never really had a problem with acne up until recently. She's gotten acne that has left these reddish/brownish marks on her cheeks and chin that won't fade. It has been destroying her confidence recently as she has decided to not meet up with friends or be in any pictures because she hates the way her skin looks with the hyperpigmentation left behind. 

Last week, my relatives came over to celebrate Christmas with us and my mom wouldn't stop pointing out her acne marks and scars to our relatives and constantly would tell everyone to not let Alya eat sugar. At one point, my grandmother made these \*AMAZING\* cookies and Alya was about to eat one and my mom went, ""NO! DON'T EAT THAT! DO YOU WANT YOUR SKIN TO GET WORSE? THIS IS WHY YOUR SKIN IS SO BAD.""

Alya instantly retracted her had and looked completely humiliated. When I was around her age, I also had to deal with acne that left marks on my face and it demolished my confidence. I had always wished I had something to coverup my scars when I was going out. I decided to take it upon myself to buy her a little bit of foundation to help her.

My mom is a firm believer in natural remedies and won't let Alya use anything that isn't [this face mask](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwil7oflgOjmAhVSneAKHUdiAasQjRx6BAgBEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCauvery-Natural-Sandal-Herbal-Grams%2Fdp%2FB01GF89B78&psig=AOvVaw3i0riF1yIOfuF-dr-m0QVB&ust=1578160672626903) on her face and insists that she puts a crushed tomato on her face everyday. I believe that these remedies might eventually work, but they'll take a lot of time and I wanted her to have something that could help her cover it up now. My mom is also very vocal about not wearing makeup if you have acne, but I don't think she understands how much Alya's acne is bothering her. 

I bought Alya some good quality foundation and she was super happy with it. She wore it when we were taking New Years pictures and my mom noticed and flipped out. She was angry with me going against her wishes and said that I was further ruining Alya's skin. I feel really bad for going against what my mom wanted, but at the same time, I feel like I'm helping Alya out by doing something that will help her confidence. 

TL;DR - MY sister has a lot of acne scars and my mom won't let her cover it and constantly brings up her acne. I decided to buy her foundation and my mom flipped out and said I was ruining her skin.",0
"This is so dumb but here goes.

Last night I planned an online catch-up sesh/video chat with my friend Mara. We haven't really gotten to talk since she moved across the country six months ago, and haven't really seen each other since COVID started.

About an hour or so before the call I put on a cute top and started doing my makeup and hair and stuff. Nothing crazy or over the top. Just a super quick blowout to get the creases out from having my hair tied up and some eye makeup. & I put contact lenses in so my face wouldn't be obscured by the glare on my glasses lenses (I almost never wear contacts anymore).

He asked why I was getting ""fancy"" just to catch up with a friend from highschool and I was like ""Idk I just want to look cute."" He said it doesn't make sense for me to look cute for another girl. And I was like ""Honestly I love looking cute for my girl friends most of all. They give the best compliments.""

And he scoffed at that and I was like ""No, seriously, girls give much better compliments than guys. We hype each other up. 'Omg I love how you did your eye makeup!' & 'omg that shirt is so cute!' & whatever. Guys don't do that kind of stuff. So if I'm hanging out with a girl it makes me feel good to look cute.""

He didn't blow up or anything but he got like.... Quietly mad. Like he was super irritated by me saying that. And he was like ""I compliment you"" and I was like ""yeah but that's different. You tell me I look pretty or sexy or whatever. That's a different kind of compliment."" And he said ""Whatever. Have fun on your call"" and went into the other room. 

Today he's being weird and short with me and I'm second guessing the way I explained things. 

Some other relevant stuff I guess:

* On an avg day I don't do anything special. Esp since the VID. Hair tied back, no makeup, yoga pants or sweats and a t-shirt or tank. 
* I do dress up whenever we go out together or plan something special together. I spend like 2 hours between my hair and makeup on those occasions and another hour choosing exactly what to wear, so it's not like I put in no effort for him.
* I'm bisexual and this has been an insecurity of his in the past. I haven't dated a woman in 15 years and honestly don't feel like I'm missing anything.

AITA for telling my husband girls give better compliments?",0
"So I [19 M] used to be a pretty naive kid up until a few years ago, and there were a lot of personal factors to that, I couldn't figure out what's right or wrong easily , also I had gained a tendency to draw attention towards myself all the time. So this resulted in me doing the most absolute dumb stuff imaginable and people would make fun of me a LOT in school coz of that. The middle school years were the worst years of my life, I was constantly bullied and didn't even realise that I was being bullied (all thanks to my naivete) , I just didn't look much into it, and it was mostly verbal bullying. People never used to take me seriously. In the last year of middle school, I became friends with two other guys(or so I used to think), it was acutally a group of two with me being the one following around and being the 'lackey', they would constantly make fun of me, which I thought was friendly banter, and didn't say much. 

I joined another school shortly after, and I met a lot of people who I'm still friends with after graduating, and they pointed out the intentions behind my old friends were not that good. It was around this point when I did a LOT of introspection and self searching and kinda matured as a person. And I realised those old friends were actually really shitty people, so I did the healthy thing, I cut contact with them, I didn't block them but I didn't pick up their calls either

So now I'm graduated and prepping for my entrance exams for college this year, and out of the blue, one of the guys from the old friend group hits me up after 2 years, just a generic ""What's up, it's been a long time"" , and tbh I just didn't wanna fall into that pit again, so I ignored it, a few days later he messages again and again, like ""why are you ignoring me, me and [other friend] miss you man, let's meet up"" to the point that I blocked him, not a few minutes go by and the other friend starts bombarding me with messages, so I snap and just text back to leave me the F alone, you guys are toxic and helped in making my middle school years an absolute hell. He then calls me, I decline once then he texts me saying he and the other guy want to apologise, so I pick their call, both of them say sorry, they did see me as a friend but they also did confirm that they used to see me as some kind of comedic relief to both of them and they hate themselves for it  but they've grown up now and want to have a friendship again.

I accept their apology as I did feel that it was genuine, but I declined on the friendship offer and suggested that we all move on, because I can never see myself being friends with someone who betrayed me. They get all furious calling me an AH, and saying I'm being unreasonable, so I just hang up and I blocked him too.

My friends are saying that I'm definitely in the right but when I told this to my parents, they said I should atleast try being friends with them. Aita?",0
"So in my family no one really locked the bathroom growing up, neither when they were showering nor when taking a dump or a quick pee. 

But as I got older and started hitting puberty, I realised this was unusual and also started feeling uncomfortable with this. Once I was on the toilet and my mother, wanting to tell me something, just barged in. I immediately told her to leave but she just ignored it and kept on talking. Since that event, I've started locking the door. Often my parents will ignore the ""occupied"" and pull on the door and then grunt in annoyance before they make their way to the other bathroom.

Another problem is that they don't lock the door and while they may feel okay, I don't feel comfortable with walking in on my parent shitting either.

It's even worse when I lock it during showering because of cause they will suddenly need something out of the bathroom and be irritated by my ""prudeness"". My mother has told me that she ""doesn't even know what I look like naked anymore"" and that she is my mother and that it's nothing she hasn't seen anyways. 

They make me feel like an overly sensitive, silly prude when I bring this up. I just keep on locking the doors anyways, but how can I get them to lock the door as well? Is that really such an utopian expectation? Has anyone else had this struggle?",0
"TLDR: first time in marriage I am making money, high needs hubby wants me to goes halves in bills friend said I should get secret bank account.

Throwaway
Me (53f) and my husband (54m) have been together for 30 years. I worked full time when we first met, but a year into our relationship he had an accident that left him paralysed. He has some gross motor movement in his arms and can use a computer and use a fork or spoon, but he cannot do anything else.

After his accident | moved to part time work to help him with his rehab being his carer etc. I was working casual by this stage, because some days he needed me around more so I needed a job I could choose the shifts for. We struggled through and after a year of intensive rehab he found a job at an amazing company who catered to his needs and he started working his way up to full time work doing financials stuff for a large company. They paid him well...

I started working more regularly, though still part time as I am still his only carer, all our money went into building a purpose home for us. After about ten years I went through ivf and had two children. We agreed that I should be a stay at home mum since he couldn't do anything physical for the children. So that's where we landed for the next 14 years, with me doing all the physical stuff for the kids, the house (cleaning, cooking, maintenance, garden, driving around) while still being his main carer (though we did get someone in to get him up and ready for work in the morning) I still put him to bed every night.

Once my oldest was 14 l started thinking about working again, over the years I had picked up some work here or there, but my husband has been the main income earner, while I did everything else.. so at this stage I decide I am going to do another undergrad in an area that has always interested me. I start part time and spend the next four year busting my butt to make it all still work at home while studying as much as possible. I did well, got a part time job at uni and finished my degree with honours and started a PhD.

Finally, I secured a permanent position in my chosen area. My kids are now 16 and 18 and can drive themselves around though I still do all the other household things, they help as much as they can (I will allow because they deserve to be young adults and have their own lives) this year I am earning a full time income for the first time in 29years. My husband mentioned that I should start helping out with some of the bills ietc 50/50. I'm not opposed to that idea, but I still do a lot of work around the house too as well as his care work, so I don't think the split should be 50/50.

I have gone without for so long, have old clothes, an old car etc because I always felt bad about spending money on things just for me. My friend said I should get a bank account that my husband doesn't know about and just put money in it straight from work, so what hits the joint account still looks like my pay. WIBTA if I did that?",0
"So this happened in the 2022-2023 school year and I've graduated. It's just been on my mind and I'm kinda feeling like an a-hole retrospectively. I'm very sorry for how long this post is.

I was promoted to the editor position of my school's paper my senior year of high school. There were a few new faces added to the staff that year but about half had been there for at least a year. There were only about 7 of us and we did monthly papers for reference. Each person had a lot of duties, so it was not a class for the faint of heart.

Our first paper was mediocre, but that is expected. People need time to adapt to the swing of things. When our second paper was late, that was a bit of a cause for concern. My job was to set deadlines and I always made them manageable because I had the exact same responsibilities as them (write an article, get supplementary images, sell an ad, assemble a page) plus more (create templates, edit other peoples' articles, etc.). If I could meet a deadline, everyone else could too. I had a pep talk with the staff and we moved on.

And yet, the third month was also waayyy behind.

Sometime between the 2nd and 3rd editions the teacher had the audacity to email my parents saying it looked like I wasn't doing much work. I probably worked on the paper for at least 2 hours every day. I was doing my part AND other members' parts. My parents knew this, so we had a parent-teacher meeting. Up until this point, the teacher had done nothing to help me run the paper. And after the meeting, she continued doing nothing.

Homecoming came around and the staff wanted to make mums. I said they could as long as they were on track and made deadlines. Well they didn't. I wasn't going to use **my** money on people who couldn't follow clear directions. They still made them and set the paper back further. The teacher did not support the rule I had set up.

December comes around and we usually do a winter magazine. Miraculously, it came out before winter break and it wasn't bad. There are always errors, but it looked relatively good.

Usually, the staff has a Christmas party. That year, some of the staff wanted a Taylor Swift themed party. I was against it. A general Christmas party would be fine, but I felt we didn't deserve a themed party due to poor performance. It would have been better to be making a game plan for next semester than to be celebrating Taylor Swift. The teacher undermined that idea saying it was fine and we deserved to celebrate.

I was at wit's end. I talked to my parents and we collectively decided it was better for me and my mental health if I quit. So we sent the teacher an email and changed my schedule for the next semester. The assistant editor also ended up quitting.

In the edition after we quit, the teacher wrote a letter from the editor calling us out for resigning (didn't use our names).

So AITA for quitting? I did technically abandon the staff, but I kept in contact with editors in case they needed help.",0

So, it's been 2 weeks and somehow the messages are still coming in.  Thankfully the offers of charity have stopped (here's hoping they were redirected to their communities) but a good deal of them asking whether or not I stopped being a grinch and started being a good husband and father again.  So, to get those people placated first, here you go:  I DECORATED.  Pics without our faces only, sorry.

I also spoke with a financial advisor, who is helping me set up a budget for 2020, and a counselor who helped me realize that I was worth more than the goods I could offer someone.  She recommended 2 separate therapists to me, and neither are taking new patients before the new year, so for now, my wife and I are working on our budget and cleaning out various corners of the house for things to sell.  So far, we've gotten rid of some unused basement furniture, a mini fridge that has been empty for 2 years, a bunch of wine racks and paraphernalia (we don't drink at home since the baby was born 2 years ago, so no need to keep it around) as well as some other things and made about $750, more than enough to pay all the overdue bills, put some money in savings, and groceries in the cupboard.  It's going to be a long road to pay off this cc debt, but we're finally addressing the issue head on and moving in the right direction.

Since my last paycheck (that covered mortgage and utilities, no worries there, for those who asked if I was behind, thank you) I have also been offered (and taken) 3 DJ gigs for Holiday parties.  2 for personal friends/acquaintances businesses, 1 for a charity.  I refused payment for the children's charity gig, instead offering to give the money right back to the kids instead, which was gratefully accepted by the organizer.  The extra cash from the 2 paying gigs paid down some more debt, and was enough leftover to allow me to have bought some nice new books and a Moana doll for my little girl to open on Xmas morning, (to say nothing of the bags of presents from both sets of grandparents full of clothes and toys, so she'll be fine from a presents standpoint).

Inspired by everyone's offers of charity, I volunteered again at Paul's Place in Baltimore, where this time I donned the hairnet and apron and served hot meals.  Cell phones are prohibited inside, plus taking photos of yourself doing charity work defeats the purpose of said work.  I also organized a food drive at my office to provide meal kits for Christmas for needy families, and we were able to donate 574 lbs of food to the MD Food Bank!

Thank you to all who reached out and made me realize that I really was an asshole.  I let my personal shortcomings almost ruin a holiday for my wife and child.  It won't be as fancy as our last Christmases, but I have a feeling that this year will be very special to me, no matter how little is under my tree.  I realized that I have all the gifts I need, and I cannot thank the beautiful people who offered up so much charity to a grumpy stranger.  I didn't need to accept your gifts to accept your love, and the offers alone changed my life.

Happy Holiday's y'all.",0
" I (17F) was recently told by my mom that I should schedule a hair appointment because the ends of my hair were getting really split. I called and they told me they were basically all booked for the next month due to someone needing a surgery and having to move appointments around.I told my mom that and she said she could do it, and I kinda decided why not, I guess it’s good to not have a fuckton of split ends.

So she set up a chair and got the scissors and shit, and began doing her work. I was scrolling through Instagram but after the first two cuts I noticed there was a massive amount of hair on the floor. I asked her why there was so much hair on the floor and she said my hair was really damaged.

I got up and looked in the mirror and she had cut it at basically my shoulders (for context, my hair is basically to my ass). I asked her what the fuck she was thinking and she just repeated that it was damaged like some sort of malfunctioning spam call program.

I looked at a few chunks of undamaged hair in the mirror and there was 1, maybe 2 at most inches of split ends. I asked her why in the everliving fuck she had basically cut off 2 feet of hair for no reason and she now said “I accidentally cut off a bit too much”.

I pretty much had to let her finish because there was already too much gone to do anything else about it, so she kept cutting and then claimed she had “made it uneven by mistake” so she took even more off.

In the end, I was left with basically a bob cut at my chin. I was pissed as hell so I grabbed my school shit and a few clothes and drove over to my dad’s house. About an hour later, my mom came over to pick me up and take “her” car (my parents split the payments with me 50/50, so she doesn’t own it) and told my dad “it’s her custody week and she’s just being a typical upset teenager”. My dad told her to go home or he was going to call the cops, so she left, but I got a nasty text which summed up to “I tried to do something nice for you and in return you violated your custody agreement with the car I pay for.”

I told her I would be more than happy to go back to her house if she cut her hair like mine (she also has really long hair) and she refused, so I’m just gonna stay at my dad’s for the time being.",0
"My nephews both graduated from high school this morning and I wanted to sit up front so I camped out a bit in front of the entrance. I brought my folding camping chair and my headphones to listen to my show.

About 40 minutes before the school would let us inside, a pregnant woman got next to me since somebody let her in line (I assume her partner). She asked me within 5 minutes (politely admittedly) if she could have my chair as she was going to have trouble standing the whole time. I said no, sorry I need it more (bad feet/knees) and went back to my things. She asked me again within 2 minutes and the answer was the same. She however got a little mad at me and said that she was going to be struggling the whole time and asked her partner to tell me. He asked me himself (politely) and I again responded that sorry but I need it more and suggested she could wait in their car or just sit in the ground. At this point the husband directly called me an asshole but left me alone

"My (25 F) Husband (29 M) invited two friends of his over. Which is fine. I knew about it and was excited to see them again. They were coming around in the afternoon to chill in our new pool and drink a few beers. Nothing out of the norm. 

I’m usually really social, and enjoy being around with other people but around noon today I just had a small mental break down over stress and my own Personal issues from the past. 

My husband comforted me and I felt better but not social anymore. No big deal I thought, i asked my husband to tell his friends I wasn’t around. (Ive always feel like I have to be the perfect hostess for any guest-and was guilty that I wasn’t being one) 

My husband found it absurd to lie and said it wasn’t a big deal and they wouldn’t care. I didn’t believe him because in my culture it’s highly offensive to not be a hostess in your own house while being home. But I wasn’t going to argue just lay in bed and eat comfort food. 

Threw the night my husband came in a few times to randomly give me kisses before going back to his friends. He didn’t mention once that I was rude. 

 Now it’s late into the night i was watching videos about the summer wells case(super interest btw) when my husband comes in. 

H: yknow you can come out to say hi. It’s a bit rude
M: no. I told you to tell them I wasn’t here for that reason.
H: but they know you’re here. You can just get a glass of water and say hi.


I then had to explain why I felt like it wasn’t that simple.(to me I’ll have to greet ,make small talk then find excuses to leave.) it’s just not a “Hi”  

My husband realzied that I wouldn’t say hi. Shut down and apologise before saying he’ll sleep on the couch (it wasn’t even a fight, i was just annoyed- and told him so. 

I just FaceTime my sisters who said I was the asshole. I feel bad that I ruined my husband mood, but I also know when my social limit ends. 

So am I the asshole?",0
"I’m 55M. Last week, my son James 28M got married to his partner Zara 28F. They were together for around 9 years before they got married, and met in university. Zara is from overseas, she’s South Asian, though she’s been here for around 9-10 years. She’s been a member of our family for all that time, and we love her — especially as her own parents are abroad. Our family are white. 

My sister Beth and husband Tom have always been nice enough to Zara and James, but last year they found out Zara wasn’t British Asian, she was a foreign national. It’s an understandable misconception, as Zara sounds British + South Asians are a large diaspora here. 

They started making “quips” about visa marriages and “90 day fiancees” which I gather is a US TV program, not in my presence but J&Z ignored them. However after the wedding last week, we had a family dinner where Beth and Tom again brought up “visa marriage”, made a Meghan Markle joke, and then said they would only let their daughter marry a foreigner AFTER he got British citizenship. Z&J looked shellshocked as they didnt expect this to be brought up at a wedding event. I immediately uninvited them from the reception, there and then. My wife and I are paying for the reception as Z’s parents paid for the wedding, and both Z+J were happy at the un-invite. 

Beth and Tom are now playing the victim, saying they only had J’s best interests at heart because they’ve seen the “horror visa marriages can do to citizens being taken advantage of” (on TV). I said meaning well means nothing, and they’re now telling our other family that we are bullying them. Some took their side, saying they were only trying to help and I should reinvite them. 

I am refusing as I think their reasoning is bullshit. First because the US visa marriage TV programmes don’t apply to the UK, its much harder to get a spouse visa here. 90 day fiance isn’t a concern, because you can’t just get citizenship after a couple months of marriage, it’s never been the case. From what James said, Zara has spent around 25k across the years for visa renewals (her own money). Its not as simple as getting married. 

Secondly because, and James will be the first to say… Zara is far more qualified than him. She has wealthy parents, a doctorate and earns 50K, she doesn’t need our son’s “sponsorship” and would easily qualify for citizenship in her own right in a couple of years. Beth and Tom in response now say they didn’t know the visa processes were different, but my opinion is… then why insult her at her damn wedding? 

Just a lot of comments coming our way now, saying we should forgive them for “trying to help”. Wife and I refused, J&Z are happy with my refusal, but people are now making comments about it being a “reasonable” concern… when it objectively has NEVER been a concern. AITA?",0
"I refuse to let my mum take pictures of me, and recently after her taking a picture of me it reminded me why. Let's call my sibling Jen.

At the time, I was maybe 14, making my mum 45 years old. 
My sibling is two years older than me and when prom rolled around they wanted to wear a suit. 
Unfortunately both the school and our mother refused. She has two much older kids that weren't in school when proms began happening in the UK, so she used that to say that Jen was her only chance at having one of her kids going to prom in a dress. Jen hates wearing dresses or being feminine at all.

Jen accepted to wear a dress to prom, because they really wanted to hang out with their friends, but was miserable the whole night and truly hated the photographs of them in the dress. They got upset everytime our mother would show people the photos, and even after asking her to stop she said ""No these are my photos of my beautiful child"". Much to Jen's dismay.

When mum next left her phone unattended I snuck over and deleted all the photos from her phone and removed the ones she had put up online too. She tried to show our grandparents the photos and was angry she couldn't find them anymore. She accused Jen of deleting them so I stepped forward and admitted to doing it. I got an earful about how I had no right to delete ""her photos"". From that moment on I never let her take photos of me.
So, AITA?",0
"This involves me (24f) and my sister (23f). We were really close for 10 years. I loved having a sibling so close in age. Sometimes I felt like my parents babied her more than was fair, but her and I were cool. She was a friend and not just my sister and I would have done anything to protect/defend her. We both got busier for a while and it was after the business started that I notice I would get into trouble a lot more and it never made sense. I was told I was leaving my sister behind, that I needed to learn not to be mean. My parents would talk about seeing me do stuff I had never done. I was so confused. Then one night I had been at a friends house and just got home. When I went upstairs I heard talking downstairs, went down, and heard my sister say that I had told her we could play together but had ditched her for my friend instead and never even told her. The next morning dad told me he remembered me promising my sister to play with her and how I never followed through and that was not a good big sister move. I told him I never promised that but he shut me down.

This continued for months. She would say I had said something that I didn't, or that I was mean to her, that I let her be bullied, that I was pushing her away all the time and breaking promises. None of this was true. I was busier with school and extra curricular stuff but we still spent time together. It wasn't as much though but we couldn't have spent the same time together. 

I told her to stop. She told me there was no way because I didn't get to ditch her for my friends, that she should have gotten all my spare time. I told her it wasn't fair and she had friends too. Our relationship turned bitter on my part afterward. I started to hate her instead of loving her. We would fight anywhere and everywhere. Eventually, it built up and up and when I was 17 and she was 16, she went to our high school principal and said I had cheated on a test and that I had told her at home. My parents were called and I was investigated. Even though the school cleared me, my parents still believed it AND I missed out on a great opportunity because the allegations were still being investigated. I never forgave her for that. 

A couple of times after we both moved out she told extended family members about all the ""bullying"" I subjected her to. It further reinforced my dislike of her, maybe even true hatred.

Now I'm getting married. I asked my two closest friends to be my bridesmaids. My sister found out about this and told me I should have asked her, and told me she wanted to do it. I told her there was nothing in the world that would make me ask her and I would sooner have no bridesmaid than have her as one.

She called me a bitch and now I am getting hassle from my family too. My parents have also tried but they're not even getting an invite because I blame them for believing all this and not putting a stop to it. But I worry I crossed a line.

"For my FIL’s (58M) birthday this year, my MIL (57F) planned a weeklong trip with their four children (EDIT: my husband is the second-oldest) and their respective partners. They rented out a nice house near the beach and **the cost for the airbnb was split equally between the attending couples**.

My husband (31M) and I (29M) drove down there this week and when we arrived in our (EDIT: pre-assigned) room, we were surprised to find two single beds. At first, we shrugged it off and figured we could simply push them against each other, but we quickly found out that the headboards of the beds were drilled to the wall. (EDIT: The headboards were attached to both the wall and the bed frame. I assume it’s to prevent renters from moving the beds and possibly damaging the flooring etc.)

I asked my MIL why she had chosen a house that didn’t have enough double beds to hold all of the couples that were invited and she told me to stop making a fuss because it wasn’t that big of a deal.

I then asked why she hadn’t mentioned it beforehand and she rolled her eyes at me, saying that I was overdramatic, a ""walking stereotype"" and that me not clinging to her son for a little while might be for the best.

Considering she has made some borderline homophobic comments in the past (she claims they’re jokes), I was quite uncomfortable and based on her remarks, I felt like she had given the room with the single beds to the only gay couple on purpose.

I said that if it wasn’t that big of a deal, surely she and her husband would be happy to switch rooms with us, but she once again told me that I should quit making a fuss and walked away from the conversation. 

Afterwards, my husband tried talking to his mother but he wasn’t anymore successful than I had been and at this point, I was reaching my breaking point, so I asked my husband if he’d like to spend our vacation at a hotel (as we had both taken the week off work anyway). He agreed and we booked us a room at a hotel a few towns away.

My MIL has accused us of ruining her husband’s birthday and ""dividing the family"", because two of my husband’s siblings support our decision. My in-laws and the last sibling have been texting me, calling me an AH for turning my husband against his family and egoistically manipulating the vacation.",0
"I (15m) and my dad (37m) have been all by ourself for as long as I could remember. My mom was never around and my dad never made any efforts to date, at least not ones he's told me about. I don't have any siblings, and most would think that means I've had everything I've wanted but that isn't true. My whole life me and my dad has struggled, our heads barely above water until about a three years ago.

A three years ago my dad got his dream job (construction) and it pays a lot of money, I'm obviously very proud of him, he deserves this more than anyone. I'll try to make this quick to get to the actual story. My dad met a woman (38f, Z), she works at the same place as him and they hit it off. He introduced me to her 2 years ago and Z also has two children (13m, twins). 

To the actual story now, since I was 5 I have been asking for a kitten. It's always been something I've wanted but never could get for various of reasons. (places we live, money, my dad fear of them) As you can imagine being a child and not have any siblings, being homeschooled with no friends, and your parent always leaving you alone, it's so lonely. I've tried multiple time to plead my case and have gotten one of the three reasons above. 

Well recently I have been in charge of watching Z's kids whenever she and dad has anything they want to do alone. My dad and Z have been talking about moving in together which is kids haven't had much say in but by the different treatment we've been getting, I know I'm not okay with it. Recently the boys have been asking my dad and Z for a puppy, and lately they've been putting it off. Until valentine's day when Z and my dad sat us down and told us that they'd two surprises.

One being we're all moving in together, the boys were happy and immediately started calling my dad things like pops, dad, etc. Obviously I wasn't happy so to cut the celebration short, I asked what the second surprise was and you guessed it. A puppy, I told my dad that it wasn't fair that the boys get a puppy after asking for a few days but I don't when ive been ten years, he responded telling me I was being selfish and childish. And now the house is really tense, and I'm thinking I'm an ah. 

(Sorry if the story is patchy, english is my third language.)

edit: I didn't mention this before because I didn't think it'd be important, but I have spoken to my dad privately on multiple accounts. I am going to try again with him alone then him and Z.",0
"Long story short, me and my partner had a new baby 2 months ago and during that time my partner was fired (Right after Christmas so we were not financially ready for this) which took him awhile and it put us behind  (I dashed during my recovery) but that wasn’t enough. 

His mil offered to let us move into her basement so we could start over, we would work and pay for our own things and save up to get our own place again. We would also pay for our own babysitter as well,. (we have 2 kids) We don’t particularly get along for other reasons (she told my partner to put our son up for adoption for starters) and we were told by his dad that she had planned to charge us rent monthly and we have no issue paying her. 
However I called her and explained that she should have told us so we could plan accordingly rather then move and be hit with that news on which she stated, she didn’t think it was important and I told her that it was, and that by blindsiding us was not the move to make.
She then called my partner to tell him that I was being dramatic (he didn’t think so) and I refused to move in anymore because this isn’t the only time she’s blindsided us.
 I wasn’t comfortable paying her what she was charging ($700. She pays $150 a month TOTAL)  when I could just renew my lease at $715 a month. 

Edit: she originally did state that we wouldn’t pay rent (which we planned to pay something whether it was helping with electricity or her groceries because we didn’t want to live there free, I just didn’t like that I wasn’t warned what we were paying or that we were paying at all) ",0
"So I 16M am in a school theatre company. And there’s this one girl in the theatre company 17F who got casted as the lead in our play. Anyways since the beginning of the casting she has shown no motivation or commitment to this play. She either comes in late (20-30 minutes) or doesn’t show up at all. This has gotten me and some of my other classmates and peers frustrated since she is in every single scene! We were supposed to do this play in the last week of February. But now we have to delay the play 2 times. 1. We are 4 Months into production and she still isn’t memorized and she is the lead of the play 2.  She won’t be here for the entire month of March. So now we keep having to delay the play until either April or May, since that is what works best for her. And consistently she has shown a lot of disinterest in this play, whether it’s the script the story or the people in it. When we were auditioning she gave a whole speech and narration about how this was her dream role, and how much she loves theatre. Then after casting she told me and some other classmates that it was just a lie so she can get the part. She also said she joined this class so it will look good on her college resume. We’ve also been noticing her attitude isn’t great and she is being cold, and not putting in a group effort when trying to rehearse or work with us. Anyways this week when we had our meeting, I asked our director if the lead was here. He said he had no clue, and she didn’t say anything. I brought up to him that we should recast since she is barely memorized and having a lack of commitment. Everyone in the class seemed to agree and were saying that they should recast her. Then about 15 minutes later she showed up late. The next day apparently one of her friends told her what the class and I said about wanting her recast. And she is very mad, and upset with us. On one hand I believe she should be recast since she is bringing the team down. On the other hand I feel bad since I said that infront of the class with her fellow peers, so everyone heard it, and I know how that can make someone feel bad. ",0
"So last week, we were assigned a group project for my history class. Me and my friends (I will call them Sonya and Gianna) immediately decided to work with eachother. However, someone in need of a group, I will call her Abigail asks if she can join. We say yes.

We begin to work on the project which has multiple part: 2 essays, a slideshow, a worksheet, and a quiz. We all start working on separate parts, and I hear Gianna suggest to Abigail that Abigail could do one of the essays. we all share the same documents so anything added we should all be able to see and at this point everyone has opened the document, so we know everyone is aware it exists.

On the second day, I realize that while we have all done stuff, Abigail has done absolutely nothing. I dont bring it up though because I can hear her typing, I just cant see it on the document. I assumed she was writing it in a different document for some reason and would transfer it later. I even scooted back a little bit and saw paragraphs of writing. At the end of the class period I bring it up to Gianna who then tells Abigail that I can do 3 paragraphs and Abigail can do 3 paragraphs for it.

On the third day, 2 days before the project was due, I started to get anxious because absolutely nothing had been added by Abigail for the essay. I realized if she didn’t add anything by Tonight, I would have to do it all myself. I even sent her an email asking if she had written any paragraphs and if I could see them. later this day I spent hours writing the whole essay by myself.


on the day its before it’s due, she leaves a comment at 11 am saying that she would have done it, but she saw that I had already written it all and if there was anything she could do to help just ask. At this point the entire project had been finished in its entirely. I was mad, I thought and still think she’s bullshitting, she had nothing written at all for the days we had to do this because she knew that someone would eventually do it for her.

The presentation is now tomorrow, my plan of “revenge” is to add a credit page that lists what we did and for her name I’ll put nothing. i also left a comment back to her comment saying “That’s okay, you can make up for it by giving the presentation :)”. before anyone says I should tell the teacher, I cant because knowing him, he won’t do anything about it and she’s apart of a team he coaches. Is it too rude to make her give the presentation and have her be shocked when she sees the credit page that says she did nothing?

I asked my friends and some think I should do it, and others think it’s just too petty. What should I do?",0
"My (15F) mom always told me that my dad left as soon as he found out that my mom was pregnant. When I was two, my mom married a man who has three kids (currently 21M, 19M, and 17F). My stepdad was the only father figure I ever knew and when I was younger I wanted him to be my dad. But he never accepted me. I also have four half siblings (12F, 9F, 9M, and 7M). 

My stepsister is definitely the favorite out of us older kids. It often seems like my stepdad only cares about her and the younger ones. My mom and stepdad don’t have a lot of money so it’s pretty cramped. I have to share a room with my half-sisters. I always have to wear my stepsister’s hand me downs and we live in a shitty neighborhood so I go to a shitty school. Sometimes we don’t even have enough food. 

About a year ago, a woman contacted me on Instagram and told me that she thinks I might be her husband’s daughter because he was dating my mom a few months before I was born. She told me that my mom ghosted my dad shortly after she got pregnant and moved to a different state. He tried to find her but he couldn’t. I didn’t believe her at first but after she sent me a picture of my mom and her husband I decided to ask my mom. She confessed and told me that she left my dad because she didn’t want to commit to a relationship.

I continued talking to my dad and stepmom and they decided to come visit me. After I told him what it’s like at home he told me that he would fight for custody and the court would probably listen to me if I said I wanted to live with him. I wasn’t sure at the time because I didn’t want to just abandon my mother. I told him I would think about it and let him know. 

After thinking about it I decided that I’d rather live with him. My stepmom always wanted kids but she’s infertile and she already loves me a lot even though we’ve only met a few times. They also have lot more money than my mom so I could have my own room and new clothes and I could go to a much better school. I know my reasons are really selfish but I would have a much better life with him. 

After I told him, he went to court and got primary custody of me. My mom’s been giving me the silent treatment ever since but yesterday when I was packing she yelled at me and called me selfish for abandoning her and my little siblings as soon as my dad showed up and said that if my dad loved me so much he should have tried to find me earlier. I think she’s the selfish one. She kept me away from my dad for the first 14 years of my life. Honestly, I think she’s just mad because she won’t have anyone to watch her kids anymore and because my dad’s been paying her $1000 every month since he found me and she won’t have that anymore. 

Everyone except my younger half brother and stepbrother is acting like I don’t exist. My dad is going to pick me up on Sunday and honestly I can’t wait.

EDIT: Some people are confused about the child support situation. My dads been paying for the last year, not my whole life",0
"{SHINYPEARLZZ}

\[Hello, this was a year ago, but I am curious.\] One day I had to do a group reading with those one girls who are horrible to everyone. They talk sh-t, they push people, they are just bad in general. So, when I got put with them I DID make my uncomfort clear to my teacher but she said ""To deal with it, you'll be fine"" And I didnt push it because I understood I would have to work with people I dont like sometimes. So, I sat down with my group and we worked, I was a bit distanced for them because I was uncomfortable with their presence. But one of the girls, let's call her ""T"" . T said ""Hey, can you move closer to us please?"" I didnt want too because they made me uncomfortable but I did it because I needed too. Everything was ""fine"" during the times I had to meet with them. For context, THEY KNOW how I feel about them and I have Social Anxiety. So, one day my teacher asked us ""if we wanted to present in the middle of the class"", everyone staring at us and stuff. I wanted to say no, but my teammates kept saying ""Us, Us, Us, Please!!"" So , I didnt really have a choice so I said okay and joined. The discussion was fine till this girl ""P"" gave the group members a high five and then tried to give me one. Im not a fan of physical contact unless I LIKE someone, I said ""No"" and then shook my head and went back to my seat. A few minutes later my teacher pulled me aside and said ""That was cold of you, you should of just said yes and gave her a high five"" That confused me, I specifically told my teacher I was uncomfortable with them and I argued back I said "" But I didnt like her touching me, and I didnt wanna go and do the presentation in the first place"" . My Teacher said to me ""If you didnt wanna do it, you could of said no, and they could have done it by themselves"" That's what got me upset, I did feel bad for saying ""No"" instead of ""No thank you"" but my teacher literally said ""You all have to go , or you cant at all."" It got me emotional and I started to cry, I know, I know kinda baby-ish but she was like yelling and scolding at me. Then telling my parents . So, I would like to know .. AITA for not wanting to high five the girl when she tried to give me one?",0
"Last night, I (M22) was walking my dog (Romeo, M3) when I got a call from my roommate (M21, fake name: Andy) telling me he was inviting some friends over. Fine with me, he called first to warn me and I used to work with 2 of those friends at one point. Those two will be called Brian and Zack. He also invited another guy, Cedric, and C's gf came along. First time meeting Cedric, but saw him a few times at parties and didn't care for him (long story, not relevant)

Romeo is a big dog but can sometimes be scared around men. When I arrived at the door, Romeo immediately barked at the sight of Zack, Brian and Cedric.Then, Cedric made the first comment that rubbed me wrong. He asked ""yo what's wrong with your dog, why is he being a bitch"". 

I looked at him kinda surprised he called my dog a bitch, especially when I didn't even introduce myself yet.

During the evening, Romeo was going around, trying to get everyone's attention (usual) except he was avoiding Cedric (very unusual). A little later in the evening, we were smoking on my balcony, sitting in a circle, passing it around, with the dog outside of the circle, just doing his doggy things. I hear the sound of a lighter flicking, and I look towards C (sitting opposite of me). He has his left hand outside the circle, and my dog is right by his hand, trying to smell him. I stood up, and asked if he just ignited the lighter in my dog's face ! He started saying things like 

""Chill out man"" ""it wasn't even touching him"" ""trust me I've had dogs for years"" ""he's a big boy he can take it"" 

Each time I answered something like ""yeah...but no."" ""Still, dont fucking do that"" ""just no"" 

I continued denying any excuses he had because it didn't matter to me, and it got a little awkward around the balcony. I get that my dog is big and barked at him in the beginning,  but still. Use some common sense, a flame near a dog full of fur is never a good idea. To calm me down, Andy said something like ""we all do stupid shit when we're high"" and I really disagreed with that ; I told Andy ""We both smoke regularly, did we ever do shit to Romeo ?? No cause we're not f**king morons"". Calling him a moron was out of line, and he stood up (with a ""ready to fight"" stance)

I told C to get out immediately, he started arguing but I went to wake up his gf and both told them to get out of my home.

C got out whining it was unfair, and Zack & Brian stayed a little bit. I immediately told Andy that I don't want C ever coming here again, that he acted like an idiot and that weed does not excuse bad behavior with animals. A agreed that C did something stupid with the lighter, but thought I overreacted by kicking him out while calling him a moron. Z has a pet too and agreed w me, saying that if anybody did this to his cat he would have lost it. Brian didn't voice his opinion. 

I shouldn't have insulted him, it's not in my nature, but he crossed a line with my dog, and I took it personal. Romeo is my only responsibility, and I can't tolerate anything negative done to my pet.

So, AITA for kicking Cedric out ?

Edit: gave fake names instead of letters, makes it clearer

EDIT 2: Thanks everyone for the kind comments, I knew deep down that I made the right choice, but this thread solidified my beliefs. I will be having a discussion with Andy tonight about the situation, and you guys convinced me to stick to my guns on this. 

And to anyone wondering what the handsome Romeo looks like, I dont know how to use imgur but there's a pic of him on my profile ! 

Thanks guys!",0
"My wife and I had a pretty normal marriage. No kids, both employed and really happy together. For 99% of our relationship we didn't have any major problems, we made time for each other, so on and so forth. 

She recently went away with her friend for a girls trip. The first two days after she came back everything was fine, and on the third we went to dinner with this friend and her boyfriend. Dinner went well, came home and went to bed. Wife woke me up in the middle of the night crying saying there was something she had to tell me. Long story short, she had cheated on me the entire trip and her friend had cheated on her boyfriend as well, apparently the dinner together caused her to have an attack of conscience because she messaged my wife after I had fallen asleep telling her that she was going to come clean to her partner and my wife had to tell me as well or she would.

We talked, yelled, cried. I spent most of the night sick. Told me it was just a horribly stupid decision and was perfectly happy with me (which honestly makes it worse, why risk a happy marriage for an affair), it wasn't my fault, the usual. I've been staying at my sister's place while we figure out the divorce.

Before this went down she had been scheduled for tests and scans for what we thought were relatively non-serious health problems. Turns out we were wrong, as I was just contacted last week by her cousin telling me a scan revealed cancer. I got in touch with my wife and we talked, she proved her diagnosis and filled me in on some details. She was understandably terrified and begged me to come back, to talk to her, hug her, give her a chance, to be there with her. I told her I wished her all the best, I'm very sorry for what she's going through and know she's strong enough to make it through but while I'd help financially from a distance, I wasn't physically going back.

They (not her) have been harassing me, telling me to man up and go to her. My own friends are split 50/50. I don't want to go back. Before anyone pulls the ""this is probably why she cheated!"" card, no. We had a good marriage, we had a sit-down talk every month to discuss anything wrong. We were solid. She just chose to take a chance on a quick thrill, despite knowing cheating is a 100% dealbreaker for me. She never even planned to tell me until her friend forced her. While I certainly don't think anyone deserves this and I am sorry it happened to her, in my opinion her diagnosis doesn't change our situation. I feel it'll be harder on both of us with me being there knowing I won't forgive her when it's over. It feels like prolonging the inevitable, and I feel like my obligation to her ended when she chose to betray our marriage. She has family and friends so she isn't alone. I care about the woman I thought I married, but I no longer love who she turned out to be, so I feel it'd be unfair to both of us for me to be there. I'm not trying to punish her, my heart just isn't in it anymore. AITA?

**Edit**: To the reddit detectives further down. When I said ""we talk every month"" about our problems, it doesn't mean we only talk once a month in strict time slots. We talked as often as needed, but made a point at least once a month to sit with each other and check in, see how we're feeling and so on. Secondly, I mentioned she proved her diagnosis because when I was told I didn't believe it, I figured it was a ploy to get me to come over and talk because she and her family had been trying to get me to reconsider from the moment I left. I also didn't want numerous answers to be filled with that exact same speculation. As far how she cheated the ""entire"" trip, the two of them went with the purpose of meeting up with two specific people her friend knew. And I figured this would be easy to figure out but I guess not, I knew her friend forced her to tell me because I demanded to see their messages after she told me she cheated. Finally, I know a lot of people post made up stories. I'm not one of those people, but short of providing personal details I can't prove it. If I wanted karma I wouldn't be on a throwaway, I posted here because when some of your own friends are telling you that you're unreasonable I think it's time for neutral third party judgement and I was hoping for valuable insight, which many people provided. To the mods, I'm sorry this post wasn't a great fit here. I'll post in the appropriate subs in the future.",0

My husband (M33) got into a car accident almost a month ago, He's been bedridden due to a back injury and I've been his primary caregiver. The pressure has been too much from my MIL, she keeps telling me to take care of him and be there for him constantly. She begged me to take time of work and I did, asked me to send her hourly updates about his condition (first 2 weeks) but when I don't she'd get mad and cause an issue. She visits everyday but doesn't do anything to help, alternatively, she'd list all the things I should or shouldn't do. The family keeps telling me she's just worried sick for her son so I try to stay calm.


Days ago, she called to berate me about not replacing the sheets quickly, I had no idea how she found out since my husband didn't call her. My sister inlaw called me to tell me that her mom installed a camera in the bedroom to see if I was taking proper care of her son. I was stunned, after searching the room I found the camera, I called my MIL and had a huge fight with her. She admitted it and said she was just feeling concerned and wanted to make sure her son was being cared for (despite him calling her everyday) I yelled at her telling her that she's no longer allowed into my home after this. She lost it and went on a rant about how I'm stopping her from seeing her son and that not seeing him will literally make her sick herself. The family called me later to get me to back out of this decision but I told them she breached my privacy and took advantage of the situation, they said I'm taking it too personally and that I can't blame a concerned mother for wanting to make sure her son's fine, especially since she listed things she thought I was doing wrong. I ended the conversation but my husband is upset telling me I'm being vindictive and that if his mom can't come then he'll move there with her. We argued then I went outside and he's been silent eversince.


AITA.?",0
"  
  
My husband (26M) and I (25F) moved into our new home about 6 months ago, and we live in a HOA. This is the first time either of us have lived in a HOA and we’ve been trying to adjust and learn more about it. We’ve been starting to get more involved in the community as time has gone by.  
  
One of the families in our community is a family of 4, the mom Jen (33F), the dad Manny (32M) and their two boys, Rayce (13M) and Murray (11M).  
  
My husband and I have met Rayce a number of times in the past 6 months, always in the fitness center. The minimum age to use the fitness center alone is 13, so he’s just old enough to be there without parents, so we hadn’t met his parents or Murray yet. Rayce would talk to us sometimes, about a variety of things like his girlfriend, school, ect. He only brought up his family a few times, and the main thing we remember about his family was that he told us he hated his brother, he told us this was after Murray had been transphobic to one of Rayce’s friends, so we could see why he was mad. He mentioned his brother was “introverted and nerdy” and was glad he never wanted to go to the gym. Rayce also mentioned he was not a natural blonde one day. He was talking about how he and his baseball teammates dyed their hair blonde for some tournament he was in, and when Rayce saw the blonde, he liked it better than his natural dark brown hair. Rayce has a fairly normal fluffy, fairly short haircut that I’ve seen a lot of middle school boys have.   
  
On Saturday, our HOA had a “winter block party”, so we decided to go. We ended up running into Rayce and his family, my husband made a comment about how Rayce didn’t look related to his family bc he dyes his hair, then Murray said “like a f\*g”. My husband and I were shocked and didn’t know what to say, but we could see Rayce was uncomfortable. Murray and the parents had walked to a different booth at the party, when Rayce apologized to us and told us Murray will regularly make bigoted comments and it embarrasses Rayce but the parents do nothing. My husband asked Rayce if he needed help, he said he didn’t care either way. My husband and I went to the parents and told them we were concerned for Rayce, they told us to mind our own business and said that the boys “already hate each other and don’t need more division”, she said that “you Gen Zers are so judgy when you’re not a parent yourself and told us to f-off.  
  
After the fair ended, the mom went on Facebook and posted about me in the HOA group. I explained my side of the story online to. Since then, my husband and I have gotten dirty looks from some people in the community. However, on the upside, Rayce told me that hes thankful for us because other members of the community have called out his parents for their parenting and now his parents feel pressured to punish Murray. AITA?

"Hi all, 

I ( 23 F) just got my very first job as a full English receptionist (  y country is a french country in west Africa). Though I'm extremely proud of myself and excited to start I feel like I have done something wrong...

For context, up till now I always lived with my parents, they were always strict specially my mom so I kind of grew up in a very sheltered and studious bubble. 
When I was 18 and moved out for studies I went crazy with the freedom and got a baby girl. She's now 4 years old and minus the initial anger and confusion now everyone in my family loves her to eternity. 
Since I got pregnant my mom got fired from a high paying job and got so much money from it she decided to start a business
 I won't be too specific with it. But the problem is of course this business can't give the family the same status we had before. So we don't have a cleaningady coming in everyday anymore. 
Ever since I've been the cleaning lady responsible for everything from food, cleaning, laundry, dishes, to the point that a cup of milk can stay on a table for a week and have worms in it if I don't pick it up. More than that I have been doing all the business administrative work being accountant, assistant, making the products, marketing and sales etc. 
I also have siblings that are 10 years younger than me and trough the years I also been responsible for their lives basically. 

This situation had me so stressed and depressed cause I had no more social life outside of reddit and twitter. Living like a stay at home mom but a full time worker as well inside the house 24/7. 

I finally got linked by a twitter friend to a new job. The pay isn't great but at least it was a job with a salary and away from home. Like one hour away. 
When I shared the news with my mom she seemed...pissed off? I don't know she congratulated me in a very off way, then proceeded to tell me how I needed to put the house back in shape and clean before going for my new job. She reminds me everyday of how I'm gonna leave her with all the work of the house and the kids to handle alone. 
I know there's so much work but am I wrong for wanting a bit of freedom and another carrier ? AITA If I Leave for my own good ? AITA for finding a job ??",0
"So yesterday my husband he's expecting a package and that it's a Christmas present for the family. Today it gets here and I'm less than impressed. It's new winter tires for the car. I'm pretty pissed off about it for a couple reasons
- tires can be expensive, I feel like he should have discussed it with me before buying them. He didn't even mention to me that he needed new tires.
- I don't drive, the kids are too young to drive, so I can't see how it's a present for us (he says because he drives us around and don't I want us to be safe on the road?)
- I just don't think something like tires should be a Christmas gift.

He says I'm being ungrateful. I say it's an asshole thing for him to buy new tires for the car and say it's a gift for the family. Who's right here?

Edited to add: I'm not mad that he bought the tires, if we needed new tires then we needed new tires. I do wish he would have discussed it with me first though. But I am disappointed and a little angry that he's calling them a Christmas gift. To me, if its a necessity, it's not a gift.

Also, apparently his mother gave him money towards the tires. So he could talk to her about buying them, but not me?",0
"I am a student worker/leader which part of my job responsibilities are to connect with other students.  I have this “friend” who is also a student at the campus who we will call E. 

Noting also that I am a chronically ill student who is an ambulatory wheelchair user who also uses 2 canes for additional support when I do walk short distances.  This is important parts to the story.  

E had peer pressured me into going to their party.  Of course sounds weird but let me explain: when E initially invited me, E chased me down & interfered with my work until I said yes.  When I did go, it was basically all family that went so it was a little awkward.

After that, I had gotten mobility aids due to my struggles with my disability (the chronic illness) - a Rollator first but after about 4 months & muscular weakness, I made the switch to a power wheelchair. 

When E first saw me with those, E looked at me all weird & loudly asked why I was using them.  I get the asking part fine but looking at me strange I never understood. 

 The past week my work has had events since the semester first started up again.  I was helping with set up or trying to work  the events which include talking to other students.  E sees me trying to push a wagon, I’m doing fine with it since I just learn to adapt since I have my wheelchair.  I was also talking to one of my former classmates to which E rudely interrupts with “do you need help?” Really loud.  I replied “no thank you.”  I continued talking to my former classmate then we went our separate ways.  I come down further with the wagon, E stands in my way (which is dangerous for a powerchair because it can run your foot over or the footplate will push you).  E says “I think you need my help.”   I said again that I didn’t need their help.

The most recent thing was the final straw for me.  I was talking to another student who is super nice, this student has a speech issue so I was listening intently.  E sees that I am talking with them, comes up, acts like the student  is invisible & rudely begins talking about how one of my bosses wouldn’t allow them to get a 2nd blanket - my coworker said the same thing that E didn’t need a 2nd blanket as those were very expensive.  E went to an info session just to get the blanket with no intention of going on the trip.

I didn’t say anything but I was upset with E because of it but I have told them that I no longer wanted to continue our friendship.

ATIA for being fed up with this behavior?

TLDR: Chronically Ill student is fed up with E’s rude behavior & ended friendship because of rude behavior?",0
"My daughter Leah’s mother and I were never married but we did officially separate when she was five. I got with my wife Niyah when Leah was nine and married her when Leah was 12. Leah never got on with Niyah, didn’t want to spend time with her and was just generally unpleasant to her. We are currently in family therapy and honestly I think Leah just says the meanest thing possible to avoid actually discussing her feelings with us. She’s absolutely amazing to hang around with one on one but is unpleasant around Niyah. 

We were all supposed to spend Christmas together, as per our custody agreement. Leah is sixteen now and we have been more lenient but we have always adhered to our agreement for holidays and birthdays. On Christmas Eve Leah left to see her boyfriend’s family and drop off her gifts. At around six I call her and ask when she’s heading home, she says she’s staying. I know her mom lives near her boyfriend and asked if that’s where she was going. She didn’t answer. I told her to come home and she pretty much agreed but then never did. I did call her boyfriend’s parents and they confirmed she left to her mother’s and I called her mother who said Leah was there. 

Niyah was heartbroken because she felt like Leah didn’t want to be there because of her. This year Niyah handled all the gifts, she did the work of going in store and picking them up/picking them out. I decided my daughter wasn’t allowed to shit on Niyah’s efforts to at least be civil with her, so when Leah got home and I asked why she wasn’t at Christmas, she said she wanted to spend it with her real mom. I said that’s fine. When she asked about her gifts I said her “fake mom” got it for her, so she didn’t need them. Needless to say, she’s pissed at me and hasn’t said anything. Niyah appreciates me putting my foot down, but feels like Leah is a lost cause and to just give her the gifts. Leah’s mom agrees she needs to stop treating Niyah badly and expecting no consequences. AITA?

Note: She has the gifts her mom and boyfriend and other family got her. Just not the one’s Niyah helped with. 

I got her a car for Christmas, gifted it to her in November because she needed the car.

Leah is an only child on both sides. I have no other children and don’t plan to. 

I am fine with having a relationship with Leah outside of Niyah. My issue is she treats Niyah badly, like subhuman. She acts outright nasty to her. I wouldn’t push so hard if she could at least be civil. ",0

I am worried my cold presence might stir up some emotions for her on an already painful day. The thought of seeing her is already making me super stressed.",0
"I (27f) have solely been responsible for cooking Thanksgiving dinner for 20+ people for the last 8 years. I do all the shopping, cooking and setting up. 

Months before Thanksgiving I start looking at grocery prices and tweaking recipes to fit dietary restrictions(Caribbean family, vegans and pescatarians, meat eaters). I also make enough for the college aged kids to have left overs. 

I usually make 3 turkeys, 2 party pans of mac and cheese and a party pan of mashed potatoes, stuffing, green bean casserole, collard greens, yams, mini seafood quiches, stuffed mushrooms, rolls and a salad from scratch. 

Plus all the desserts apple pie, sweet potato pie, cheesecake,  homemade ice cream and 
breads also from scratch. 

I start making stocks and doughs Tuesday night. I bake my bread for stuffing and make my cheesecake and pies Wednesday after work. Cook all day Thursday so we can sit down and start eating at by 4 so my aunts who work the nights shift as nurses can enjoy. 

Every year people invite unexpected guest and it becomes 30+. I would be ok if it were plus ones but my mom invites her friends and their kids. 

My mom and aunt ask me to make additional turkeys and some sides for their units. I never feel appreciated for everything I do to make it special and accommodate everyone. 

This year I’m separated from my husband and I really don’t feel like bending over backwards cooking for people who don’t even leave me left overs to make a sandwich the next day. 

This year I’ve decided not to cook and just spend my day at the beach, the only bonus to living in. Florida. 

I was asked how much the adults should Zelle me for thanksgiving groceries at the beginning of the month and I told them I’m not cooking. Today I received a zelle from my uncle and when I returned it he asked why, I reminded him and the family group chat I wasn’t cooking. 

Now they want me to cancel my plans and cook. Am I the AH for not wanting to?

EDIT: This is my favorite holiday but my separation has left me emotionally exhausted and without any passion to cook. 

EDIT 2: I don’t actually mind the cooking for my family, I look forward to it. The unexpected guest a little. The thing bothering me is that I expected to do this year is that I wanted to celebrate the only holiday I look forward to with my husband. I wanted to share the dishes that I love and  scheduled chaos with him. I’m upset because I don’t get my husband. They may not understand it but I took on this holiday because I enjoyed it. ",0
"throwaway bc he spends a lot of time on reddit. this is the most ridiculous argument i’ve had with a grown man. 

I (28f) have been with my boyfriend (36f) for a year and we moved in together about 4 months ago. 

One of the first things I noticed about my boyfriend was that he never really ate vegetables. He would sometimes eat them if we were out at a restaurant and they came as part of his meal. But he never ate them when I cooked for him. Originally I thought that maybe my cooking was the problem so I asked him if he enjoyed my food and he told me he loves my cooking. On nights I didn’t cook for him, he ate exclusively frozen foods and never ate the vegetables in those either. Naturally, he has some health issues. Vitamin deficiencies etc. he had phrased it to me as if he was somehow just genetically unlucky. I believed it for a while bc idk how that stuff works but eventually it became clear to me it’s because he voluntarily eats a vegetable like once a month. 

6 months ago I started hiding vegetables in my cooking. If I was making pasta I’d put the vegetables in I’d usually put in for myself, then take half out and blend it so he wouldn’t notice the vegetable chunks and then tell him I’d just scooped the veg out of his portion. This happens more often now we live together because I do all of the cooking. He’s been telling me a lot lately he’s been feeling a lot better the past few months and has even had his doctor reduce the dosage of some of his medications and he hasn’t had to take his multivitamin in weeks. I kept my mouth shut because I’m just glad he’s feeling better and it really does me no harm to hide the veg in his food. 

Yesterday, I was making one of our regular pasta meals (it’s one that’s very easy to hide at least 4 veggies in) and i was about to blend my boyfriend’s portion when the blender died mid-blend. I had to serve it in all its veg chunk glory.  My boyfriend refused to eat the vegetables but when he tasted the sauce he said it’s weird how it tastes the exact same even though this one has veg in it. So, I confessed. He screamed at me and called me a controlling bitch and said that it’s none of my business if he thinks vegetables don’t do anything. I pointed out he said he felt better. He said his health was none of my business and that I’m a controlling, judgey AH and stormed out of our apartment to stay with his sister. His sister texted me to say he’s fine but she agrees with. him. My friends agree it’s ridiculos that he didn’t eat veg but agree I’m being an AH. AITA?",0
"I was married to my husband for 13 years, we got married at 19 and my husband passed away a few months ago. We didn't have children together. 

I have a high paying job as an attorney and I'm currently moving to another state to start my own firm. 

My husband passed away 4 months ago. It wasn't a pretty end to our marriage as I had just found out that he was cheating on me with one of the waitresses working for his restaurant. They had been having an affair which went on for 3 years. He told me he didn't love me anymore and left to be with her. He passed away due to a sudden cardiac arrest after 2 weeks of leaving our marital home. We weren't legally separated. It wasn't official. 

As his wife, I inherited everything, including the restaurant as he started the restaurant after we got married. My parents helped him financially and I supported him after I got my first job. 

After finding out about his infidelity, I had no interest in keeping the restaurant. It was doing really well, but I needed a fresh start. 

My husband was emotionally attached to his restaurant and wanted his kids to take over after he died. He wanted it to be  a family enterprise. 

I didn't want any part of that. I made the decision to move to another state for better prospects, and decided to sell the restaurant. 

2 days before I made my final move to sell it, his mistress showed up to my home begging me to not sell the restaurant because she was pregnant. She wanted her unborn child to take over the restaurant. She said that the child was morally entitled to the restaurant as his unborn child. 

I simply asked her to leave and went ahead with my decision.

This happened yesterday morning at 9 in the morning, I f33 was in the kitchen eating breakfast wearing my regular underware. Suddenly I heard gasping sounds coming towards me, I turned and saw mother and sister in law yelling about what I was wearing. I was in utter shock and just froze in my seat. My husband was asleep at the time and he must've heard his mom and sister scream because he ran downstairs asking what's going. his mom started ranting loudly about what an appropriate scene she and her daughter saw. I'm still sitting in shock when my husband started yelling at me to go put something on quickly. I went upstairs while his mom kept yelling after me calling me shameless and inappropriate I then heard my husband say it won't happen again. I was so mad, I put a coat on and went downstairs and started arguing with my mother in law. I told her she shouldn't have come over without notice but turns out my husband told her to come over at 9 to discuss a family crisis. My mother in law said I was in the wrong for walking around half naked knowing she has a key and might show up any minute. I told her it's my home and she said it's her son's home too. we argued and my husband told me to knock it off and apologize but I refused and went bavk upstairs. then after his mom and sister left he called me childish and inappropriate. I tried to explain my side but he said what's done's done and he promised his mom that I will apologize but I said I will never apologize and she's gonna have to wait for decades for that. He got upset and called me disreslectful towards my guests. and mother in-law was technically a guest so...

he's still nagging me for an apology to his mom via email to get this over with. AITA for not apologizing? I'll apologize if it turns out that I'm TA here.


edit - Wow, So there's too many comments here and I can't respond to all of them, however!!! I jus saw some info questions - And I'll answer them below.

* First and formost, I'm not american (I wish lol) you guys probably figured this out by my horrific grammar lol but I did my best.

* Mother in-law has a copy of the key, After what happened I told my husband to tell his mom to give the key back but he said no and that he won't punish her for something I DID.

* Yes, he tends to take her side more often. She's super conservative and does not like me very much.


* Oh and one more thing. this ""country"" I live in (not my country originally) treats women as ""possessions"" e.g instead of calling me by my name they would say ""Eric's wife"" or ""his woman"" which is rude and offensive. another e.g is that there are lots of places women can not access and seeing a woman drive can be seen as an unusual thing for them. the reason I married my husband was that he was different from them. Truth be told, I've been feeling overwhelmed and depressed lately and mom isn't near so I could visit and vent to her.",0
"I (18F) am a freshman in college and got randomly assigned with my roommate. In the first semester her long distance boyfriend, who is 4 years older then us, came to visit twice. Once when I was away for the weekend and once during a break when I went home. Both times he stayed a day longer then I was away. The first time this happened I slept in my own bed sharing a room with them. The second time my roommate asked if I could give them alone time and I slept on my friends floor.

Recently she asked if I would be traveling this month and I said no. She informed me that she was hoping for her boyfriend to come visit and stay in our dorm room for 3 nights as hotels are expensive. I told her that I did't feel comfortable sharing a room with them for 3 days and didn't want to sleep on my friends floor again. She said that her friend has an air mattress I could borrow and I told her I didn't want sleep on a random persons air mattress nor did I want to impose on my friend and her roommates room for 3 days especially as she wanted him to come during a time when I have exams and need my room to study. I asked her if it would be possible for her to wait till spring break to see him or to visit him as he has his own apartment rather then him come here. She said she really wanted him to come here. And I repeated that I didn't want him to come. She then left the room.

When she returned it looked like she had cried and she told me that it makes her very sad when she can't see him for a long time and that I'm not letting her see him and that if my long distance bf came to visit she would gladly sleep in someone else's room. I said that wasn't the point and that if he really wanted to come he could find a cheap hotel.",0
"This has caused a lot of mixed reactions and I want unbiased opinion. Neither me nor my late husband and his girlfriend have any children.

I(35f)  got separated from my husband(37m) over 10 years ago, unfortunately he has left me with a lot of debt to pay and in a position where I was nearly homeless. I have only stopped paying the debt off 2 years ago but there is still a lot of work to improve my credit history. Because of all the stress he caused me we never got divorced or formally separated. A matter of fact is we never spoke after I was kicked out from the flat so his girlfriend ""Anna"" can move in. I was planning to file for divorce once I have enough spare income, but some events took place before I was able to do so.

Now to where I can be an asshole: 2 months ago my husband passed away in a freak accident. He left no will behind and has a house which is paid off with his girlfriend (he ended up having a big promotion at work). I have spoken to the lawyer and because we never divorced or filed for separation I am entitled to half of the house as his next to kin. 

Last week I have informed Anna through a letter that I want the house to be sold. She can either buy my half or I will have to force a sale, it is up to her. I do not want to live in the house, but the money from the sale could really help out to sort out the damage done by the loans I had to pay for the ex as well as a deposit for my own place so I don't have to live in absolute shitholes due to poor credit/not a very high paying job. It will also help me to work on my qualifications so I can get a better job and retirement.

However Anna and my ex's family have called me a massive asshole, saying I have no right to the house (legally I do) and that I am being cruel and vindictive. I have reminded them that it is not my fault their son haven't divorced me or had a will and said I don't see how it is unfair as I had to pay for his debts while he lived a comfy life. 

So Reddit am I the asshole?

Edit: I have seen this coming up as a question a few times and don't want to keep responding with the same comment. My ex has maxed out my credit cards and took loans in my name as well as cleared our savings account to fund his relationship with Anna and some of his gambling habits at the time. Due to being busy with work I haven't discovered the loans and cards being maxed out until it was too late and I had a few notices of non payment and him kicking me out and basically making it seem to everyone that I had the problem and he loaned me money which ""I"" paid him back by taking loans and cards as well as if ""I"" wanted him back so mad him ""gifts"". The total amount of debt is a bit over 50k which also resulted in me loosing my job while he got to keep his well paid job.

Regarding the house - both Anna and my ex are on the deeds and had joint mortgage from what I was told, so legally she is entitled to the other half of the house",0
"I posted an update about the situation [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ecstatic-Wrap-5947/comments/13297eg/aita_for_not_telling_the_nurse_at_my_nieces/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)


I (29F) was supposed to pick up my niece (Sophie - 7F) from elementary school and spend a day with her. It was all mentioned before to the school and I've picked her up a few times before.

Sophie was running towards me, but unfortunately she tripped and fell down. Her knee was bruised and she started crying like crazy. I took her to the nurse's office immeidately. The nurse was in her early twenties and helped sophie with cleaning up her wound and dressing. 

I tell my niece a lot about my line of work so she asked if she was going to need stitches, if so, how many and what kind, etc. The nurse was impressed. She showed Sophie a few items of equipment she had and asked if Sophie wanted to be a nurse like her. Sophie said no, she wanted to be a doctor like her aunt aka me. 

The nurse got a bit upset and asked me why I didn't say anything about this. I was honestly confused. I was like why would I need to even mention it. I even threw in a compliment saying she was quite good at her job and I enjoyed witnessing a professional at work. 

She said I was being too generous with my comments. I told her I was being honest and thanked her for taking care of Sophie's knee. Right when Sophie and I were leaving, she said she'd never be able to guess my line of work correctly because I look better than most of my colleagues. I thanked her again and said I appreciated her help.

She said I still owed her for not telling her my job and that it felt like I was testing her or deliberately trying to see how she was doing. I apologised and said that was not what I meant and that I knew she was more than capable of doing her job well. She said maybe I could find a way to make it up to her properly and I was like sure, but Sophie and I need to go now. 

I don't know if I was rude but this had me thinking, should I have told her about my job??

Edit: I'd like to thank everyone for their lovely comments and making me realize what was going on this whole time. I'll post an update if anything interesting happens in subsequent days. Thanks again!",0
"Nine months ago, I (53f) asked my SIL (47f) if she wanted to go see a concert by an artist we both love coming to town. Right before tickets went on sale, I asked her what her budget would be to see the show, and she said she wouldn't know how much she could spend for awhile. The pre-sale window was short and I knew the show would 100% sell out so I bought 2 tickets at \~$550 each and informed her of the price, and told her if she can't go I would take my husband. She responded with ""That works! I never go on vacation!"" She didn't give me any money/payment plan/, and we never mentioned the concert again until August.  
  
In August, I made a Facebook comment about how excited I was for this upcoming concert, which she must have seen because she swiftly reached out to me saying she forgot about the show and is going to pay me a little bit of the total until the show in november, and sent me 85$. We went back and forth about how excited we were for the show, and I let her know I could provide housing and transport for the night of.  
  
Since then I have not heard a word from her about the concert or received any money and the show is in a week. I don't want to be stuck for the tickets (as she has not repaid me for things in the past), but I would feel like an asshole for taking back my offer. WIBTA if I send her the $85 back and take my husband instead?",0
"My (28f) brother George (17m) recently applied to his 5 universities (we’re from the UK) and has received acceptance from all but 1 of them who have yet to render a decision (it’s for a very popular course). I’m extremely proud of him. All of them would require him moving quite far and while he won’t have to worry about his tuition fees, he will only be eligible for the minimum amount as our parents earn over the limit. 

My parents refused to help me for my university at all as they’re extremely traditional and don’t think women should go to university, so they made it clear I’d be on my own. So I worked through my undergraduate degree, my masters and now my PhD. I didn’t know when George was born whether they’d pay but when he hit high school they started saving. It didn’t last long though, my brother didn’t do all that well in the first few years and his practice exams didn’t go well at all in 4th year, but our parents have always told him he was ‘fine but not smart’ and so I think that got in his head a bit. When he failed his practice exams, they spent the money on an expensive holiday abroad (which neither of us were invited to). George confided in me his ambitions and that he really wanted to go to university so I helped him study. He worked hard and did well enough to be able to take the classes the course he wanted to do asked for and I’ve been helping him when he needs it, but it’s mostly just been reassurance that he’s doing a good job and I’m proud of him regardless of what happens. I started saving the second he confided in me he wanted to go. It’s not much since I have my own tuition and stuff to pay for, but it’s enough to match the amount he’ll get on his student loan for first year (about 7k). 

He’s waiting for his final result but he’s pretty sure he’s going to one specific university, which is the same university I went to for my undergraduate degree and therefore I know that without parental help he’ll be screwed and so I will continue to save and help out where I can. Our parents walked in on me explaining to George the terms of him getting access to this money -I’ll transfer him a specific amount every month he’s at uni on the 1st of the month, but any big deductions like textbooks I’ll pay for directly and deduct that from the monthly amount. (I’m just trying to make sure he doesn’t do the classic blow it all in one go). My parents blew up and said I’d overstepped, that I undermined them and was absolutely out of line and it’s not my responsibility. I agreed and told them it wasn’t, but if they’d been responsible and had believed in them I wouldn’t have to. I don’t feel like I did anything wrong but I also feel extremely guilty. AITA?",0
"Little backstory - wife (40s) and I (40s) have 6 six kids and she is a SAHM. About 15 years ago, D (wife) got really into crunchy momma stuff - oils, homebirths, homeschooling, backyard chickens, homesteading, etc… she found some online forums filled with others who were into it and became some sort of minor celebrity within the forums. Minor, because there was another woman who was the sun of the universe there. Very knowledgeable and pleasant and my wife ended up with a little crush on her. They spent a lot of time together over the internet and the phone. They bought each other little gifts for bdays and holidays. They became very close. The group was time consuming but pleasant. Until another woman came into the group. Within a year, she’d ostracized and bullied anyone who opposed her, including the previous sun. Classic Mean Girl shit. I’m a teacher at a high school and told D several times that the group had gotten out of hand and was too stressful. D cried over the situations and felt pulled to be at this new woman’s beck and call. I tried to sympathize. D feels things very hard but I got annoyed with her for not dropping the group. Eventually, it imploded but not before so much online drama that it bled over into our RL and it affected our marriage.

Present day - D recognizes the screen name on a forum she’s just joined. Looking at the content, I agree with D that this person is likely the person who was the girl crush from before. This poor woman had been intensely harassed by the Mean Girls. We’re talking fake wellness checks and CPS reports, posting about personal insecurities and sharing screenshots of private messages, publicly making fun of her in the forums at large, a private Facebook group made just to talk shit (which she was then invited to, just to see how many people were involved), and even people who had previously sent her Get Well cards now using her home address to send her mean diet articles from magazines. D didn’t take part but didn’t attempt to put a stop to it and didn’t leave the group until much later (when other women had then been abused). She wants to reach out and apologize. I said that’s shitty and she needed to leave this woman alone. She said I was an asshole for making her feel badly about something she didn’t do and yet was still wanting to apologize for. I disagreed and said D would be the asshole for dredging this up and that her apology was too little, too late. 

So, Reddit, am I the asshole…for telling my wife that she would be the asshole?",0
"My (18F) family and I went out for a meal the other day, as we are staying with my Grandma and Uncle, neither of whom have any desire or ability to cook. Since we had been traveling in the car all day for about six hours to get to where they live, a notoriously uncomfortable activity, I pulled on a simple comfortable t-shirt and a pair of leggings to meet them at the restaurant, as well as a hoodie to wear since it was raining (for context the restaurant we were meeting them at was Wetherspoons. Hardly fine dining and a t-shirt and leggings is 100% appropriate attire at face value).


When we had finished saying hello and everything and sat down, I took my hoodie off. My uncle looked at my t-shirt and immediately hissed at me asking what I was thinking wearing a t-shirt like that in public and to go back to the hotel and change. I refused because I didn't want to walk all the way back to the hotel in a thunderstorm just to change my t-shirt (the hotel is about a five minute walk away but I didn't want to delay people getting their food for fifteen minutes while I walked there, changed and came back, and also it was raining cats and dogs).


The t-shirt in question has a joking picture of the cover one of those vintage kids books published by ladybug in the 50s. It says ‘Activities for children: Let's summon demons’ and what looks to be some kind of satanic ritual happening in the middle. It's by an artist called Steven Rhodes who makes a lot of similar t-shirts and it's the first one that comes up if you Google ‘Let's summon demons t-shirt’. 


My uncle is very religious (Hare-Krishna) and refused to speak to me for the rest of the evening after telling me the t-shirt was extremely inappropriate for someone my age to be wearing anyway. Honestly that was fine by me as all he actually talks about is his religion anyway so I just played hangman with my sister on the back of a kids menu until our food arrived lol.


After we left my dad said I really should just have gone back to change my t-shirt, and now he's getting shit from my uncle for allowing me to wear the t-shirt in the first place. I hate to see my dad stressed and it really was only a short walk back to the hotel to change. From my POV I really don't think the t-shirt is even that offensive however I totally recognise that I might have been the asshole for being stubborn rather than just changing. My uncle is still refusing to speak to me and I'm wondering if I should have just caved. Am I the asshole?


ETA: Adding some extra context to clear some stuff up!


1: My uncle is a Hare Krishna, not a Christian. I kind of understand where all the comments calling me a nob and accusing me of wearing the t-shirt intentionally to stir shit are coming from but I honestly didn't even know Hare-Krishnas believed in demons?? As far as I was aware Hinduism doesn't buy into the abrahamic concept of hell/Satan/demons. The rest of my family is atheist so I really barely thought about it in all honesty. It really is just a comfy favourite t-shirt.


2: He is not a close family member. He irritates the crap out of me and we try to limit contact with that side of the family anyway.


3: I am in England. Please stop telling me about my first amendment rights. I don't have them and God knows I have no idea what they'd be if I did.


4: I didn't put the hoodie back on because it was a thunderstorm and the hoodie was SOAKING.

5: Didn't think I'd need to say this. I am not Steven Rhodes. You can check my Reddit account lmao.",0
"I’m the fourth oldest of ten kids. My mom is currently pregnant with her eleventh. Yup. Ever since I was twelve I wanted to move out. I’ve been saving up money. It’s been hard actually not spending but I’m now 21 and have saved 7 thousand dollars. My mom knows I work full time but I lied and told her it was unpaid internship otherwise she would have made me give her the money. Her boyfriends literally don’t have money so she has been my siblings and I’s checks since forever. I’m sick of living in this house with so many people, there’s nothing more I want than to move away and live by myself finally. 


My friend and I always talked about moving to New York and her uncle is a super who offered us an apartment at a really good rate recently. The idea went from being just something we talked about to actually being a reality. Once I secured a job interview, I knew it was time to tell my mom I was moving out. Despite having four older siblings, none of them have moved out. I didn’t know how she’d react. She was extremely upset and asked me how I had the money to move to somewhere as expensive as New York and pay rent. I admitted to saving money and that’s when she lost her shit. She started screaming up how I know she’s struggling to pay rent and pay for her baby’s formula and diapers and one of her twin toddlers had to have surgery two years ago and I didn’t offer a dime and they’re my siblings. 


Two weeks before my flight, my mom fainted at her job and was hospitalized. They said that the pregnancy was too high risk, she had problems with her other pregnancies before this one and almost died with her last pregnancy and they advised her to abort otherwise the baby could cost her life. She refused to abort saying she’s been getting pregnant since she was fourteen, it wasn’t gonna kill her now. She’s was in the hospital on bed rest and she called me begging to send her some of the money not even all to pay for a special procedure to help her baby. I literally can’t afford to waste a dime, my money isn’t gonna last long and even with a job lined up I didn’t want to risk potentially wasting all my money before I even got to New York so I told her I couldn’t. She went off calling me an asshole saying moving isn’t as important as her and her babies life. All of my siblings are saying I’m evil and that I can wait to move later and that I’m young and I’m a major asshole for not helping at all. Once I get more stable I do intend to send her money. I offered 500$ and she hung up. I don’t know if I’m wrong or not.

Thank you all for your advice. I feel much better about my decision. I’m staying at my friends house with my bags until our flight tomorrow. Your words of encouragement have been nothing but amazing. I don’t feel bad at all anymore.",0
"EDIT:  I have been taking all of the advice and comments to heart, but at the same time trying to give my husband a chance, because there have been such beautiful times. We had an amazing breakthrough. Came from literally rock bottom, but the last two days have been great. He was sharing everything that was happening in the game and all the drama. Because I had found the real details of who he had been talking to. Long story short, now he wants to catch up other “Friends” who “haven’t done anything wrong.” And I am now again the bad guy for asking for details.  Apparently not allowed because they haven’t broken his rules of “privacy”. I just tried to compare this to my hobbies, of which I would have nothing to hide and again it feels he’s way too invested in the relationships he’s built. I have made pros and cons based on all of your responses and I was on board for leaving, but things got better, but because of all the comments about cycles of abuse this is it. Thank you all again for your comments and advice. 

I had hip surgery yesterday and for the past few weeks my husband has been trying to convince me that I need to recover upstairs (15 steps) in our bedroom. His main reasoning for this was that I would not be able to use the 1/2 bath on the first floor. I suggested a seat riser for the toilet which was immediately shot down. I ordered one anyway because my anxiety was out of control thinking about going upstairs. 
We have a room on the first floor which has the computer and a twin bed I could use. He went to play his game tonight and when I got tired I headed for the computer room. As I was getting settled he said “so you’ll be staying down here the whole two weeks?” as he reached for the power button on the computer. He was clearly in the middle of what I can now only assume was ERPing. I said I wasn’t sure, but at least for tonight I can’t think about going up the stairs. I then got up the courage to say I think we need couples counseling, to which he replied “I don’t”. I calmly said we should at least talk about it which he then flat out said, “I don’t want to”. My eyes immediately started to swell up and I said that was really hurtful. He didn’t say anything else.  

AITA for wanting to stay downstairs? Was he intentionally trying to get me to stay upstairs? Is he only refusing because he doesn’t want to hear what a counselor might say about his behavior? Why else would he refuse?  ",0
"My husband's brother, 35m, his wife, 26f, and two boys (4 & 3) moved in with me and my husband (both 30) last month because they got evicted. I never wanted them here in the first place due to past issues, but after speaking with my husband, we decided for the sake of the young children to give them a place to stay. Before they moved in, we set some ground rules such as my BIL must be actively job searching and that they must RESPECT our space and clean up after themselves.

Unfortunately, in the past month, they have began to slowly destroy my home and my space without giving two shits. First of all, my SIL is an extremely picky eater so their family doesn't eat with us. Fine. BUT they never ever clean up after themselves, constantly leaving dirty dishes and pans, crumbs, food stains. When I tell them to clean after themselves, they begrudgingly do but it's never a job well done. Last week, one of the boys had peed on my very expensive couch which i ONLY found out about after smelling piss when I was watching TV. SIL is stay-at-home but she's more like stay-in-her-room, doing god knows what while her two children run rampant around my house. In the last three weeks, her boys have 1) colored on their bedroom walls 2) trashed my living room with their toys 3) knocked over half of my plant collection. Their whole family has turned my house into a fucking zoo while contributing NOTHING.

I've not been able to comfortably live in my own space for the past few weeks. My husband could sense my frustration so he told me he'd have a talk with them and hire a maid to clean our house. Things got a little better UNTIL...yesterday, I get home early from work and their family's gone. Good, I think, peace and quiet for a few hours. I decide to go take a nap in our bedroom ONLY TO FIND THAT MY PRECIOUS VASE THAT MY MOTHER HANDMADE FOR ME WAS SHATTERED ON THE GROUND (I lost my mom when I was a teen and it is one of the last handmade items I have from her). I immediately knew it was the boys because there were toys inside my room and their tablet was on my bed.

I was so angry. I ended up calling my husband, explaining the situation, and told him that they would not stay another day in our house, no questions asked. Then I went around the house picking up their dirty clothes, toys, papers, etc. and threw them outside onto our lawn.

When they came back, there was a huge confrontation between me and them. I listed all the disrespectful things they'd done and that because they'd met NONE of the conditions outlined when they first moved in, I wanted them off my property by midnight. I called their kids untrained dogs. They screamed back calling me heartless, cruel, evil, saying I'd make them homeless. Well they did end up leaving after I threatened to call the cops. Husband is fully on my side but I can tell he feels a little bad. MIL called me, upset, asking me to take them back in after I ""forced them to sleep in their car"" last night. AITA?",0
"I'm an Emergency Medical Dispatcher which basically means if you call 999 with an emergency and need an ambulance there is a chance it'll go to me. It's a rewarding if stressful job and some of the calls i've handled give me nightmares but I wouldn't change my job. Some of my hours however are extremely unsociable and sometimes I get home at 4am and when I do I have a routine. 

When I get home at 4am i'll quickly change then go for an hour long jog while I listen to podcast. This jog by 5am will take me to my boyfriends bakery where we will share a meal: breakfast for him, dinner for me. On the days I work this kind of shift it's the only time we can see each other, I then help him set up a little before heading back to my home and sleeping. 

All in all nothing abnormal ever happens but a new neighbour recently moved into my cul-de-sac, a woman in her late 30s or early 40s i'm not sure, I don't know my neighbours THAT well as I don't often have the ability to socialise with them due to my work hours. During one of my recent jogs I paused on my way out of the cul-de-sac on the pavement near her home to pick out a podcast on my phone only to have her come out shouting at me about what am I doing near her home and how I better get before she calls the police. I quickly apologised to her and explained i'm her neighbour, and just out for a jog, she didn't believe me so in sight of her I had to go unlock my front door to prove to her yes I lived here as she kept shouting about the police, after this she stopped and retreated back into her home so I continued my jog.

Except she was watching me the next time I jogged and the next, and the next. Each time calling out vague threats about the police and how I shouldn't be out at this time and how I was scaring her children always being out at this time, now I admit i'd finally had enough of this and laughed at her because i'm a 5 foot tall woman who looks like a solid breeze would blow me over I also told her to mind her own fucking business and how only she seems like the weirdo here always watching me go for a jog at this hour. I also told her if she called 999 to say hi to my co-workers for me. 

I'm not proud of how I lost my temper but it is getting to me how she is always doing this, it wasn't until my boyfriend suggested over our shared meal that day that maybe she just had anxiety and seeing someone outside so early put her on edge and she was handling it poorly, I admit I felt guilty after that i'd thought me jogging for an hour after my shift was harmless but i'm used to being up at weird hours am I the asshole for jogging at this time? would it freak you out if one of your neighbours did this?",0
"**EDIT TITLE: I meant to ask: AITA For giving my husband fake key when he demanded to drive my car?. I'm sorry I made some errors. title can't be edited.**




I (f#31) became the only income earner after my husband Jeff (m#35) lost his job about 9 months ago. He doesn't have a car anymore because he sold it to be able to pay off debts.


He started asking to drive my car with the excuse of wanting to look for a job. there are 2 problems with this...first is that I'm a nurse I work odd hours and need my car most of the time and he literally takes it all day and comes back late in the evening. second is that every time he comes home the car either has a busted taillight, damaged front, flat tires etc, etc, etc.

So far I had to spend nearly $300 bucks to get it back in good shape. I told him I no longer want him to take my car but he said I had to let him drive it so he could continue to look for a job. I told him he could search online but he said something about scammers trying to pose as potential employers just to get his personal info (never had this happen to us).


Days ago, he went out with my car and I ended up being late for my shift. I called a friend to cover for me and tried to call him but he returned home at midnight. I had a fight with him after he said he was with friends and time passed by. I took the key of the car and put it under my pillow then went to sleep.

The next morning I saw him standing near the bed wanting me to give him the car key so he could go ""lOoK fOr A jOb"" I said no but he got mad and started demanding I hand it over. I told him FINE and pointed towards the sock drawer where we had lots of junk and told him it was there. I lied and he got some old key that looked like it. Once he walked out I locked the door and got in bed. Few minutes later he came back and started pounding on the door asking if I gave him a fake key. I said I did just to get him off of my back..he started yelling at me saying I was being childish and demanded I open the door and give him the real key. I remained in bed while he kept yelling outside saying I'm giving him lot of shit for not working YET not willing to let him *effectively* look for a job. He also said that I'd been testing his patience several times and he's had about enough. he yelled some more then left.

I was so infuriated and just maddened about the whole situation. I had a shift to cover and I knew that if he took the car then he won't bring it back in time. I got to my work and we haven't talked. He was in full sulking mode after I returned and kept ranting about how unsupportive and childish I was to pull this stunt.",0
"My (35f) husband (38m) and I have 3 kids. We'll call them Annie (10f), Joey (5m), and April (3f). My MIL has always favored Annie. She would take Annie for the day and leave Joey behind and buy Annie tons of shit, but nothing for Joey. She would say he was too young to even notice, blah blah blah. My husband fought with her many times and we made a rule that if she took one kid for the day, she had to take the other one either that same day or another day and that she needed to be equal with the gifts. Things did improve, but she never was fully fair. 


Then April was born, and MIL still favored Annie, but didn't leave April out even half as much as she did Joey. She was pretty equal with April and Joey, with Annie still being the favorite. I honestly wasn't sure if she was beginning to learn her lesson or if she was just making an effort because she didn't want us to restrict access to the girls. My husband was an only child, and I've wondered if she just preferred girls. 


Last year, Christmas was the worst. She got a few games to be shared among all 3 kids. She got the girls each a blanket, and April got this big stuffed thing - it's like a cat unicorn fish; I dunno - and Annie got a few other things. Joey didn't get anything outside of the shared gifts. My husband and MIL got into a pretty big fight over it, and she said she just couldn't find anything he would like. Ok, this kid isn't picky. He gets excited over new clothes, and you could throw a dart down any toy aisle and buy whatever it hit, and he would be over the moon. Luckily, Joey didn't notice. We let him open all the shared games so he didn't pick up on it. MIL promised not to do that again. 


Now, my issue. I'm pretty much expecting MIL to pull the same shit. If it was up to me, we wouldn't accept gifts for any of the kids from her. My husband said if it's uneven this year, then we can go nuclear, and she won't be allowed to gift the kids anything or see any of them one on one. Joey is definitely old enough to notice at this point. I'm still expecting MIL to pull the same old shit. WIBTA, if I get Joey more gifts than the girls and c also get April a little more than Annie, just to try to even things up? I don't have a favorite child - I love them all equally - but it pisses me off to see one of my kids left out. And Joey really is the sweetest little boy. If he gets a treat, he makes sure his sisters also get one. If he gets candy or something at school, he saves part of it for his sisters. He has such a beautiful little soul, and the thought of him being hurt makes me so damn angry.



UPDATE: I know that Joey is getting at least one gift from MIL this year. She told us that instead of buying them a bunch of little things, she wanted to get them each one big thing. She asked me what they wanted that we hadn't already bought them. Annie wants a cotton candy machine, and Joey wants Luigi's Mansion 3 for the Switch. They asked for those after we were already done with our shopping, haha. MIL bought both of those things. April hasn't asked for anything specific, but she's only 3 - still at the age where you just know her interests and get her something along those lines. MIL was talking about a little cocomelon computer thing. 


If this ends up being it, then we won't have any problems, but if MIL does end up going overboard with Annie again, we'll have a problem. Grandparents, like parents, aren't allowed to play favorites.

"My atheist girlfriend 29F is upset on behalf of her Scientologist family that I read their confidential religious texts that people spend decades and $$$ to read.

My girlfriend 29F and I 29M have been dating for a while, she's a wonderful woman and I'd love to marry her one day.

Her family is like my family. Her brother's family are all Scientologists, they have been for decades. They're a super lovely family, who just happen to be Scientologists. They are wealthy and have invested a lot of time and money into their faith, which is very important to them.

I treat religions equally, with respect but at times critically. When I was a teenager I explored a few faiths. I read their sacred books and ended up getting baptized as a Christian. I wanted to explore the meaning of life. Christianity brings me closer to my heritage and it's a home for me to do charity work.

I'm okay with people pointing out things wrong with my Church as they're mostly correct.

I mentioned to my SO I was reading Dianetics, Scientology's entry-level book. I wanted to better understand their faith, despite the negative press. I liked the book, it's pretty conversational, half of it is self-help, the other half is fictional science.

Her brother had gifted $50k in courses for her but she politely decided it wasn't for her shortly into it. She was cool with me reading Dianetics but requested I do not read the sensitive content that is in other books reserved for higher members - this content is leaked online and most know it roughly.

On the cover of Dianetics, it has an illustration of a volcano with an explosion. It's a reference to their creation myth, which is only revealed to high-level adherents in this sensitive content.

It's super confidential, and Scientologists think non-adherents can get ill from reading it. I'm pretty curious so I ignore my partner's advice (I know, quite disrespectful) and go online and read it anyway.

I won't disclose the content but all I'll say is it's rather imaginative. I even read up to the last stage but I won't spoil it for you. - EDIT the concerning part is the highest level stuff is literally about bringing back the anti-christ.

INFO, I pirated this as they aren't able to be purchased online and if I purchased in person or with my card, they would constantly send mail like they do my SO.

I disclosed to my SO I read the sensitive content - I felt guilty. I also wanted to reflect on how Christianity in a way is as far fetched. She's outraged I would violate her trust like this. She explained it would be like reading her diary after being instructed to not do so.

I do agree it's disrespectful but if someone left a book that had written on it, DO NOT READ, MEANING OF LIFE INSIDE, I'd try and read it. I like reading, particularly texts related to different cultures.

I've apologized and promised not to investigate further. She stated that this will basically destroy my relationship with her brother and has made her question my respect for her. My relationship with her and her family is important and I simply wanted to better understand their faith and I was genuinely curious.

On one hand, she's right, it's disrespectful. One the other hand, I think I've been more than open-minded given the nature of their faith (I'm reasonably well informed about the negative press). So my question here is, am I the asshole?

Note my girlfriend's parents are Christian and she's wanted any kids she has be raised as Christian. The OT8 secret documents, the final level are about welcoming the anti-christ so it's kind of incompatible to her parents and my faith.",0
"My (25f) nan (78?) Has been to hospital twice this year. The first time was because she fell and, I don't know quite how it works, had to have surgery on her back and hip otherwise she would be paralysed. The second time she went in for a potential stroke. She is still in hospital and we still don't know if it was a stroke. What we do know is that the the surgeons accidentally cut her sciatic nerve during the surgery which explains the pain she's been in since the surgery.

I know that my aunt is mad with my mum because my mum convinced my nan to move closer to her in case something happens (aka the fall). My aunt used to live about 30 minutes away from my nan, but according to my nan she rarely visited. My nan now lives about 2 hours away from my aunt and doesn't talk to her.

Since the first hospital trip, my family (but mostly my mum) have been taking care of my nan. None of my mums other siblings are willing to help.

One day I got a message request, it was from my aunt. She stated that I needed to tell my mum that she got herself into this mess and if she hadn't manipulated my nan into moving then everything would be OK. She said that she's coming for my mum and she better watch out. She had the audacity to add kisses as the end of the message. I screenshotted it and told my dad who told me not to tell my mum. Only my dad knows about the messages. I checked the next day and my aunt had actually sent another message, but both had been unsent so I couldn't see them.I was just going to leave it as that, until I found out from my mum that my aunt is now back in touch with my nan and is in my nans good books. My nan had said that my aunt thinks that my mum didn't do a good job of looking after her as she's back in hospital, and for some reason my nan agrees. Mum was going every day before and after work to take care of her, and sometimes sleeping on the floor to make sure she was OK, but my aunt reckons that mum should have quit her job and looked after my nan full time and my nan agrees.

Me and my nan are fairly close, so I know If I tell my nan about my aunt's messages she would believe me, especially if I show her evidence. However, it's also not fair to my nan who currently believes she has her other daughter back and is still recovering in hospital. But also, its not fair on my mum if I don't tell my nan as its ruining their relationship.",0
"My (26M) sister Maya (25F) is engaged to a man from a middle eastern culture. We were raised with no religion or big ethnic customs. Her wedding is set for March 2022. I also just got a save the date for one of my college friends on the same date in a different part of the country.

Now normally it'd suck to miss a friend's wedding but sister probably overrules friend. The thing is, her wedding is going to be in the custom of her fiancé's family, which is to segregate based on sexes and not allowing alcohol. Meaning I'd have to be totally sober and not even allowed to hang out with my girlfriend. That sounds like a boring time for both of us. My friend's wedding is more ""normal"" American in that there's no separations and its an open bar. My girlfriend and I are both pretty good friends with the bride and groom and it will be so much more fun. I told Maya I'm not comfortable with the setup of her wedding and am going to go to my friend's instead and she's super pissed at me.  I told her if they have a more normal one I'd go but Im not going to spend money traveling and for a hotel to be sober for a weird wedding and not even be allowed to dance with my gf when I could go to a good friend's wedding and have a great time instead.

My parents are kinda with me too. My dad said I should put my gf first and agrees it wont be nearly as good of a time. My mom isn't exactly thrilled about the culture Maya's marrying into (it's very sexist) and said while she's sad I wont be in the pictures, she gets it. Maya however has not taken it well and keeps texting me about it accusing me of not only being a bad brother but of being Xenophobic..Thats not accurate as if it was another culture that allowed men and women to spend time together at weddings or atleast drink I'd go but this is just weird. Right now Im just leaving her on read while I think of what to say.

\*  When I say segregated, I don't just mean the seating to eat. Its separate rooms for the entire event.

Didn't expect this big of a reaction. I'm going to log off now feeling pretty assured of my decision. Thank you",0
"30f, I have 2 sons. I left their father (29m) 5 years ago after he chose his mother over me and the kids (I got an apartment and he refused to move in because mommy convinced him not to). 

Despite the ill blood his mother and I had in the past, we overlooked this for the children's sake and built what I thought was a pretty solid foundation to a certain degree of trust and respect. She took the kids every few months despite her son failing to continue visitation with his children.

Last year she was diagnosed with a disorder that makes her lose weight, lose hair and bruise easily. It does not cause her pain but it has triggered insecurity, understandably. During this time she started lashing out on me pretty frequently. Hust being incredibly bitchy for no reason and would pull the ""I wont let people walk all over me"" lines (I'm assuming that due to her insecurities following the diagnosis she also became paranoid because no one was walking on or bashing this woman). But regardless, I became her boxing ring basically and 3 months back, she pushed it too far. 

I had made a comment about her son never seeing the kids and she freaks out. Calls me childish, says ""I told you not to fucking bash me"" (I clearly wasnt), and says some backhanded comment about knowing how I am and being able to read between the lines. So I went NC after basically telling her she was full of shit and I was done being her doormat. During this time her son also coincidentally started asking for visits with our children again. Which I allowed, supervised by me, as he hadnt seen the kids in a stupid amount of time (the kids wanted to go). When he shows up he starts talking about his mother and how her condition has worsened and that I should be more understanding of her illness and accept that she is just angry right now. I told him it was no excuse for the way she spoke to me and had been speaking to me for months leading up to that incident and until she took accountability and apologized I would not be accepting the treatment, simply because she is ill. He didnt push the issue.

However, his mom reached out through text yesterday and said something to the affect of ""Well you know how I am. Stress doesnt set well with me."" No apology, just her saying I know how she is so I shouldnt be angry. I basically told her that it doesnt matter how she is and considering she was calling me childish months ago, she should take that statement and reflect on it because she is the one acting childish. Especially with her lack of self awareness or ability to take accountability and just apologize. She stops responding. I'm being told by my ex that I'm an AH because this is his mothers way of apologizing and I need to be more understanding. AITA?",0
"Context 1: my grandma and I used to share a room when I was little so we improvised a room for her but it is really small.  
Context 2: everytime someone else has to stay at our home, they stay in my room and I have to sleep somewhere else.  
  
So, my grandma left for a couple weeks (maybe a month) and her bedroom was vacant. Two weeks ago, my grandpa had to stay with us because my aunt was going on a cruise and she didn't bother to ask him so he chose to stay. I moved to my grandma's room and took a lot of my stuff with me, more importantly, a power strip that my mother had gifted me and my siblings for xmas. I wasn't planning on taking it, but the powerstrip in my grandma's room was unreachible from the bed (unless you turned upside down) and that powerstrip was ocupied. I decided to take the gifted powerstrip and it made my stay more comfortable.  
  
My grandma came back and my granpa left the same day, so I moved my stuff back to my room. Now, I already have a powerstrip with nine plugs and the one my mom gifted to me had four plus some USB ports. My grandma came to me and asked if she could keep that one and I, thinking of how 1. She'd be able to charge her phone on her bedside table instead of having to reach behind it or look for another outlet. 2. I already had a totally functuonal powerstrip.  
  
When my grandma was going back to her room, anouncing that I let her keep the powerstrip, both my mom and my sister tried to convince me to keep it (kinda like if they were selling it to me), but I told them that I already have one and that I have no use for the other stuff it has. Another thing that could have made me an asshole is that, when my mom and sister were telling my grandma that it was a chrismas gift for ME, I yelled ""it was gifted to me, ergo it is mine, ergo I can gift it to someone else"".  
  
A couple minutes later, I walk into my mothers room and the second she saw me she said ""No, I am mad at you"" and that's what made me think ""wait, am I in the wrong here?""  
  
I know it was a gift for me, but my grandma needed it more so AITA?

Update: so I gave my mom a nice pinecone and I think we're fine?",0
"My sister has adhd and has been to therapy when she was younger, but doesn’t go anymore. She also isn’t medicated anymore, because of having kids and needing to breastfeed for a few years now. It has made her difficult to deal with. Making plans with her is stressful, because she can’t commit to anything without changing the plans multiple times. If we have plans that I’ll go babysit her kids, I can expect to be called about it 5 times the day of, so she can run through what’s happening and if there have been any changes that she needs to tell me about. She has also become a bit controlling. If I’m not doing what she thinks is right, it’ll stress her out and she’ll become unpleasant. The other day I spent the night at her house, but told her I needed to do school stuff in the evening. She was ok with it, but then when I was staying up til aroun 12am to finish it, she kept telling me to go to bed, staying up is unhealthy and getting irritated that I’m not listening to her. Later I found out that she’d called our mom to complain and say that I’m ”doing bad with school stress”. It’s just not true! I was irritable because of HER. And also I’ve always been a night owl, she knows that. 

So to the current issue. Out mom is moving and sister is organizing it. I was asked to be the babysitter for the move day. Then she called and told me the move day had been changed and I was needed as general move help and not babysitting. I was mad, because the day she moved it to was a day where I already had plans of my own with our dad who is also supposed to be moving help (they’re divorced). So she essentially cancelled our plans and made us switch days with the move and our own plans. I told her it was fine eventually because I want to help mom. 

After I’d told her I was ok with the change of days I went back to bed because it was very early in the morning and I’d had a rough night the day before. I could hear her still messaging me, but I just put on do not disturb and fell asleep. When I woke up, she had called me twice and left me 14 texts that I can’t read because they were deleted. The only one I could see was one where she informed me of the time I need to be at my moms house and ones where she gave me shit for not picking up and being an active part of planning this and not being allowed to chip in the plans if I won’t be on my phone when she needs to talk about it. Apparently her planning is that time sensetive. I just pretty much ignored her messages.  

She says I’m TA for ignoring her. I think I’m not because she can’t demand me to be ready to plan with her the moment she chooses, especially because I was tired and planning with her is a literal nightmare. But I guess the reason I think I might be TA is that I conciously ignored her and let her get stressed about it and choosing to go to sleep instead. All I had told her is that I would show up to help, but nothing else. So am I TA?",0
"Edit to highlight some parts you guys skipped over 

Hi I am a 38 F married  to a 43 M and we have a young daughter she's 5. My husband has a 24 F he had her in a very early relationship in college. **Our house has only 2 bedrooms** so **at first my husband and I slept in the master bed and my daughter in the crib** while my stepdaughter occupied the other room. But now our child is growing and a crib isn't suitable anymore so **we've decided to get her a new bed in my stepdaughter's room as our room doesn't have enough space for a regular bed**. Upon hearing that she refused that her young sister to move in her room. I told her we could not have the young girl clumped in a crib so she would have a room for herself.    


&#x200B;

She has been tiresome all along. In her age and she doesn't do anything not even her own plate. **She thinks I am some kind of unpaid nanny ** to her and recently I stopped cooking for her after **she called me the B word** once and told her I didn't marry her father to coddle an adult she will carry her own shit together. She told me I am ""unfair"" and only care about my daughter not her which baffled me she was comparing herself to a child. Back to the bed argument  she accused me of wanting to make her life harder by having her roommate with a child I told her she can find herself a place if she wants with adults. She then blew off and started cursing telling me I shouldn't try to kick her out and that's her father's house to which I said I wasn't kicking you out I was giving you solutions and your sister has as much in this house as you and you'll share a room.  


&#x200B;

She left me and slammed the door then called her father crying telling him I was kicking her out of the house then he called me I explained what happened. We are still carrying the bed plans but he told me I shouldn't have told her to move out that was insensitive of me. Even though I offered to help her.


Edit 

-Yes she and her father talked about her moving out and she promised her to do when she is 22. He told me I shouldn’t have talked to her because all her talks about moving out were ones that I weren’t physically present with them wile they were having them. So she was surprised I told her that and part of it she called him crying 

-Yes her father wants her out and won’t get a bigger place just so she would get a free solo room.

-Yes she works 3 days a week and we told her we will help her 

-My daughter was in a crib first then we got her a bigger one but now she needs a regular bed that we already purchased 

-Already stated but the reason why her and I have a rocky relationship is that she expects me to be her unpaid servant while she disrespects me and expects her little sister to clumped in a crib so she would have a room.

-Already stated but a regular bed won’t fit in our room.

-Her bio mum lives out of town and she doesn’t wanna get out of town.",0
"My ex husband left me when I was 2 months pregnant. When my daughter turned 4 months old, he married his current wife. I met my husband when my daughter was 2 years old and married him when she turned 3. My daughter is now 7 years old and I have a 3 year old son with my husband. My ex has two daughters with his wife, who are 6 and 4. 

My ex has an every other weekend visitation with our daughter. Now my daughter used to call my husband 'popi' , but ever since the birth of my son, my daughter has started calling my husband 'daddy'. That's what I call my husband when I address him in front of my son, and my daughter has kind of picked up on that. 

We never told her no, because my husband loves my daughter and thinks of her as his own. He has stayed up nights taking care of her the times she has been sick.

Now, she doesn't have the same relationship with her stepmother. She has always called her stepmother by her actual first name, and it has always been that way, even though her stepmother has known her for a longer time than my husband. 

Here's why I'm wondering if I'm the asshole. 

The other night, when me and my husband went to pick up my daughter from her dad's, my daughter ran out of their door happily saying ""mommy and daddy are here, I'm going home!""

When my ex heard her address my husband as 'daddy', he turned visibly upset. Later when we got home, my ex blew up on my phone saying that I was emotionally abusing my daughter by 'making' her call another man ""daddy"" and that I needed to make her stop.

 I said that our daughter has all the right to call my husband daddy if it makes her happy. He then asked me how I'd feel if he made our daughter call his wife ""mommy"". I told him that if my daughter hasn't called her "" Mommy "" after 6 years of knowing her, it is because she never wanted to. I said that it isn't my fault if our daughter feels closer to her stepfather and actually loves our family together. After saying that, I hanged up. 

The next day my ex mother in law called me accusing me of parental alienation. This is honestly messing with my mind. 

My husband loves my daughter. Is it really bad if we let her call him ""daddy""?. He loves it and in fact, he always says that he has 2 kids.",0
"I(26F) bought a hoarder house back in May 2018. It is a big 6 bedroom 4 and a half bathroom house.

When I bought it, the contract stated that I take ownership of the house and everything in it. The lady who owned it died, and her heirs could not deal with the stench and literal mountain of junk and waste in it (you could only open the door not even 8"", and some rooms had the junk filling them wall to wall and floor to ceiling).

Well it took me these last 4 years to finish cleaning, fixing and updating it. While doing the cleaning I made sure to check everything before throwing it out. Ended with more than $20k of money, some nice jewelry and antique furniture, and finally a stunning 40s style, lace covered wedding dress. This woman took care of that dress untill she couldn't anymore, and it took just some minor work to restore it.

I currently don't have a partner, but I decided that it would he the dress I will be wearing if I ever get married.

While doing the cleaning, I reached to the heirs to pass on some pictures and momentos (Christmas personalized ornaments, some kid artwork...), and because of that, I had one of them (30s F) in my FB friends list.

After repairing the dress, I put it on with the jewelry and posted a pic on FB. Well this woman saw it and asked for the dress and heirlooms back.

I refused to give them back, and legally they can't do anything. Also if they meant that much to them, they should have cleaned the house on their own, not sell it to me.

Now she, and all her family, are calling me out on social media. AITA?",0
"So years and years of backstory here. Ex wife has BPD and life with her has been a continuous struggle. We are in the middle of a divorce because while she’s lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. But she crossed that line and enough was enough. Divorce is bitter and ugly. 

For financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. I implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. The both blew me off and “yeah yeahed” me for almost a year. Ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. Instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it. Then getting mad at me when I said I had far too much on my plate to add another battle with thier mom, they had to handle it. Since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. 

I’ve had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future. On a lark I called my college roommate who is head ski patrol at a small resort in NM. He said I’m hired. I talked to my partner and he’d gladly buy my half of the business. With the 50% id have to give my ex wife I could live modest and comfortably for the rest of my life. I could spend my summers hiking, my winters working and maybe just not spend 15 hours a day at a desk working for 3 people who just see me as a wallet.

Kids would be cut off. I wouldn’t be able to afford ANY help. They have avenues and legal recourse with thier mom, whether they take it is up to them. But they’d have to grow up and fast.

Would I be the asshole if I do this?",0
"So I have an issue with my sister (35F) and I (42F) settling my mother's current estate and a friend of mine allowed me to post my issue here.

A little background, my sister ran into finacial issues about 6 years ago. She lost her job and her boyfriend was transfered out of state. So they moved into a house together but my sister couldn't be added to the mortgage because of her awful credit score. Her boyfriend passed away suddenly and had no will. His family then took the house and gave back some money my sister put into the house but they told her to be grateful for getting that much. My mother had just come into some money so she got a house for my sister and her two kids. For the first year my mom covered everything for the house. 

About 2 years ago I took my mom into my home because of health issues and took over pretty much everything for her. I realized that my mom was still paying all the taxes on the home when my sistser started complaining that she was getting all these ""scam"" calls and letters about unpaid taxes. I looked at a few and talked with her realizing she had no idea what property taxes were. I went over my mom's accounts and found she was paying property taxes since my sister moved in and even some renovations to the house. My mother decided to continue to pay for the back taxes but I got my sister to begin paying them herself.

Our mom passed away a few months ago and I am still trying to sort through her affairs. Her will states everything is going to be split 50/50 between the two of us. While working I found out my mom put both her and my sister's name on the deed to the house. After talking with my lawyer I found out the house was technically owned 50/50 with my sister and my mother, meaning I could claim 25% of the house or value of the house in the estate. 

I was going through somethings with my sister last Sunday and I asked her if she wanted me to take half of the renovation costs that mom paid towards her house out of her inheritance. I explained that I did not feel it was fair that she was being enriched by the renovations and getting the house for free as well. She got upset saying that mom's will states that everything need to be split 50/50 and that's how it should be. I brought up that I wasn't even asking for the taxes with would add on at least an extra $50k. She remained firm and I strugged saying ""well then I guess I will just settle for 25% of your house."" 

She demanded to know why and I explained that mom owned 50% on the house so half of that is 25%. She got mad and is now blasting me to the family and so understand my point but others told me I am being greedy. But I don't feel like handing over $150k to my sister for nothing but I was willing to settle for half the renovation costs of 50k.

So AITA for asking for part of my sister's house?",0
"So I (20F) got a full ride scholarship and study abroad for all 4 years of college. This year we’re going to Germany for 15 days to study the significance of alcohol in culture. Another set of students is heading a trip to Italy to study practical medicine and all that fun stuff from June 14th-June 28th. My trip is June 5-20th. Since my trip is already covered, and the university I attend is paying for my travel to Germany and back, I figured I might stay a few extra days and mark another country off my list. Just 2-3 days.

This is where it gets messy. I asked my parents if they thought this was a good idea and was met with interrogations about how much it would be, who would be there, why don’t they know them, etc. I was unable to answer this, since I thought we were just going to chat about it, and they became very hateful with me, saying it was unsafe and that I was going to get abducted/robbed/etc. I tried expressing that I felt comfortable doing this trip and that I thought it would be a good opportunity to learn how to manage in a foreign country alone. 

The conversation got heated and my parents ended up saying I was ungrateful, and that I always just ask for more and more. I didn’t ask for money, or anything though. They also stated that their sacrifices got me my scholarship. 

It is important to note that I am also going to Argentina and Canada this year, also paid for by the University, and that is a big reason that they feel I’m being “greedy”.  

So AITA? ",0
"So me and my friend stopped talking to each other for a few days now. And here's why. My white teacher said the n word, and I felt strongly shocked about it. I stopped hanging out in her class during lunch because she said, that she said it before. And as a black woman I felt uneasy. So during gym I told my white friend we shouldn't hang out during lunch in the teachers class since she said the n word. Then my friend says ""it was in a book."" I told my friend that it didn't matter she still said it.

And let me say that the teacher blocked out the word before in the book, but now deciding to say the word. I usually respect my friends opinion but this time I didn't. I heard the same thing that usually people that defend racists say, that she said to me so I said ""you're white you can't have an opinion on this."" I understand people can have opinions on things but I guess I worded that wrongly. I meant to say is some things are meant to have or to not have an opinion. Especially depending on the person and their background. And I really think she shouldn't be able to speak on something like this. But that's just me. 

My doubts and feelings have been getting the best of me lately. She was the only true friend I had. I could share anything with her and she wouldn't care or be disgusted. She didn't even care about the rumors being spread about me but still choose to be by my side. I do put my feelings and opinions before others, but why do I feel like an AH? I can't get past her opinion, but then she's my only friend??? 

So during fourth block, I sit in and she asks me if I want her to sit near me or two seats ahead of me. And I told her ""I don't care."" And she said ""no, I won't sit near you since you won't respect my opinion."" Then when I got home I blocked her number since she didn't want anything to do with me. Even though my feelings are very strong, I still can't get over her opinion no matter what. I feel strongly that non black people can't say that word. I don't care if you're reading a book, I won't allow it. I don't expect her to understand since she didn't learn about black history or grew up on it the way I did. But I'm definitely not going to educate her because some people just won't understand things or just chose not to. 

But I question myself should I have done or what should I do to help me through this? Everyone at this school don't like me and she was the only thing that would brighten up my day...",0
"I (30F) am pregnant as a single woman. My family is taking a trip to Europe for two weeks when I’ll be 34-36 weeks pregnant. When my parents go away, I watch their two dogs and I offered to watch them again during this trip. They are easy dogs and I’m local so I don’t have a problem with this. I walk them but they can also go in the yard if I’m not up to it, and they are happy to just sit with me for the most part so I don’t think it will be a huge deal watching them while pregnant. I stay at my parents’ house while pet sitting and this arrangement has always worked well for all of us. 

My brother who lives about 6 hours away by car got a cat about 2 years ago. My brother is socially awkward and doesn’t have a wide friend network. He will be taking the trip with my parents (they will be paying for him). He’ll drive to my parents’ house and then fly out with them. Recently, I was with my mom and I asked her who would watch the cat. She  stammered that my brother wasn’t able to ask anyone else and so they were thinking he would drive up here with the cat and I would watch it. Apparently neither of them thought to ask me. I have no idea when they would have been sprung on me if I didn’t ask. I was caught off guard and to be honest, I don’t want to watch the cat. I love cats and he’s cute but he has a lot of medical needs. He needs an injection and an oral medication every day. He’s on a very restrictive diet, meaning I’d have to make sure to be available to feed him on his schedule. I work nights and don’t want to have to set an alarm at 8 months pregnant to wake to feed the cat. Pregnant women also aren’t able to scoop litter boxes so I’d have to hire someone to come in for that. The cat is also extremely anxious around dogs so he would be set up in the guest room, which is upstairs so it’s out of the way. I have already been having back pain, pelvic pain, and ligament pain for a while (I’m now 25 weeks) so I can only imagine it’s going to get worse and caring for this cat will be a challenge.

I told my mom I didn’t think this was a good idea and she told me I was wrong to not make my brother’s life easier. I offered to help look for pet sitters in my brother’s area, which would benefit everyone because he wouldn’t have to travel with the cat, but she asked my brother and he feels it would be too awkward for him. The way I look at it, he’s being lazy. A free vacation isn’t a hardship and as an adult, there’s no reason he can’t make alternate preparations. There’s no reason he can’t hire a cat sitter and I think my mom is coddling him too much and he’s being selfish to want his pregnant sister to watch the cat. He’s had the cat for 2 years and this trip has been planned since August. I feel that there was plenty of time to make arrangements. I’m annoyed that he didn’t take the initiative to do that and I’m also hurt that my mother went behind my back to offer me up as a cat sitter when I’ll be so far along. AITA? ",0
"Hi Reddit!!! Happy new year.

My (17F) family asked me to make cheesecake to celebrate on new year's eve morning breakfast. For context, with family I'm talking about just my mom (52F), my dad (46M), and my three siblings (12M, 12M, 12F). I was very happy when they asked me - I really like to make cakes! I said yes, and spent my two whole days planning, cleaning the kitchen and buying the necessary ingredients for it (with my own money). Then it took an entire afternoon to make it, wait for it to chill and, why not, to decorate it (it's new year, after all).

I really put effort in this cheesecake. And so, I was excited to eat it the next morning! I seemed delicious. I told my parents I had finished it after I put it in the fridge for the night. They looked happy about it. Then, I told them how much I wanted to taste it the next day, and that I hoped that felt the same.

For context, I'm a little bit fat. I'm not obese, but I'm on a diet, it would be good to lose some weight. But, it's new year! I can break the diet for a day or two, it's not the end of the world.

Well, my parents don't think like me. They looked at me, and with a straight face told me I shouldn't eat the cheesecake I made myself with my own money because it was bad for my health. I repeat, I'm not obese. I do exercise every day, and most days I'm very strict with what I eat. And, after months of not eating much more than salad and chicken, I was hoping to have something that I really like.

I tried to argue with them, but they decided I couldn't eat cake. I was really angry. I put effort and money in it, and I was going to eat it.

This is where I might be the asshole. I waited for everyone to go to sleep, and around three AM, I got out of bed and when to the kitchen. The title probably gives away what I did... I ate the whole thing out of anger. I'm ashamed of recognizing this, but I was completely unhinged. I didn't even use a spoon or a fork, I used my bare hands. In less than thirty minutes, it was gone. Consumed. I started crying because I felt pathetic. Without realising, I fell asleep in the kitchen, with the fridge open.

New year's eve morning, my family wakes up ready to eat the cake, without knowing they would find a surprise in the kitchen. Long story short, my parents ended up yelling at me, my siblings crying, and we had to eat plain toast.

It's been a few days, and they won't speak to me. Am I the asshole?

\*EDIT\*

I'm going to answer some questions some people had:

\*Why didn't the fridge close by itself?: We have a very old fridge, we have had it since before my birth. My parents never had the need to change it I guess.

\*Didn't you feel bad/puke after/during eating the cake?: I didn't puke, but yeah, I still feel like shit. It was a mistake.

\*About the breakfast in general: I didn't think other people would find wear eating cheesecake for breakfast? We usually eat simple vanilla cakes (except me because diet), and I'm honestly surprised not more people do this? Wow. And, about the toast, it wasn't going to be plain (we had butter and dulce de leche), but idk why my mom decided to make it plain.",0
"
I married my wife Elise 12 years ago. She has a 16 year old daughter (Ana) from her previous relationship and we have a 7 year old son as well. 

From pretty much the beginning of our relationship, Ana and I have never gotten along. I don’t know how to emphasize that it is NOT because of a lack of trying. She just does not like me. When she was young she was just scared of me and “afraid I’d tear their family apart”. Nowadays it’s more of a neutral dislike rather than strong antipathy so I suppose that’s progress

Elise is a stay at home mother, so she relies on me for income. As a result, I pay for everything for Ana. Food. Clothes. Volleyball fees. Field trips. I take an interest in her hobbies. I go to her games. I’m not saying I’m perfect but I try my damn hardest to be the step-father I can. 

But it’s so... hard. Always giving me curt 1-word responses. Always having to have an attitude. She does things to get a rise out of me. Staying out late reeking of booze. Always trying to sneak boys in. Typical rebellious stuff. But I always let her know I love her and I’m there for her in hopes of her “shithead teenager” phase pasts. 

The opposite is true for her biological father. She adores him. Can’t tell you why. He never goes to her games, always makes excuses for why he doesn’t want to see her. He forgot her birthday last month and she cried herself to sleep. 

Well anyways, Friday, I came to her room to check her phone and read her messages (not a permanent thing, but she’s been caught sneaking out twice in the last month so this is her punishment). I ask for the phone, she says “no, I’m tired of you checking my shit, leave me alone”. I tell her I’m not asking again and she goes “just fuck off already. You’re not my real dad. You never have been. Stop acting like you can tell me what to do” before getting up and slamming the door. 

Like I said guys. I’m tired. Tired of the blantant disrespect. Of being the verbal punching bag while still providing more for her than anyone else in her family. 

We haven’t really talked since until this morning during breakfast. She asked if I could pay for her plane tickets so she could see her boyfriend cross-state. Like I said, her mom doesn’t work and her dad is a POS so I normally would be the one to cough up the money. Not this time. I responded “go ask your real dad”. I could tell she was hurt. Tears swelled up from her face and she excused herself from the table. 

My wife took me aside later and said my comment was extremely disrespectful. I said if anything’s disrespectful, it’s her treating me like a doormat and a credit card, and I will no longer tolerate this treatment in my house. I told her we don’t have to be friends, but if she can’t at least be cordial to me or respect my position as an authority figure, she can find someone else to pay for her non-essentials. AITA?

EDIT: Just adding a TLDR at the request of a comment. My step-daughter continuously disrepects me and my authority. She told me that “I’m not her real dad”. Later on, she asked me to buy her tickets and I told her to “go ask her real dad”. AITA?

And to add more context, my wife is a saint. She DOES stick up for me when Ana says something rude or snarky. She just said “stooping to her level” was inappropriate. But she’s a wonderful mom and tries her best.",0
"I've been friends with ""Amy"" since childhood. We are both conflict-avoidant people-pleasers due to very traumatic childhoods. We are both working on it in therapy.

As a child, I was screamed at for asking for ANYTHING or for even making a sound. I learned that the only way to safe was to be as quiet, invisible, and self-sufficient as possible.

Amy had a parent die very young, and blamed herself for not being a ""good enough"" child. Her remining parent used this death to guilt Amy: ""What would they have thought of you doing this?"" ""How would they have felt if they could see you doing this?""

Tho we have the same problem, we've been able to be very close with each other because we've had a lot of trust, and know the other person won't flip out, abuse us, guilt trip us, or shame us.

Then, Amy got married to a man who is the opposite: loud, crude, thrives on conflict. His motto is, ""You don't tell me what to do, I do what I want."" Instead of working on her conflict avoidance, Amy now has him engage in conflicts FOR her: issues with neighbors, her own relatives, other moms, and even once a problem she had at work. He jumps in on these because she asks him to. I have seen and heard her asking him to do this.

Inevitably, she had him jump in on a ""conflict"" with me. I say ""conflict"" because it was was pretty small. Amy and I had dinner plans, but I had to cancel at the last moment because I was feeling sick. I don't make a habit of flaking, and neither of us lost any money or reservations. I did cancel only 30 minutes before, because I was hoping I'd feel well enough to go. And I did apologize for that. Amy accepted my apology.

Later, I got an angry text from Amy's husband about how inconsiderate I was, how Amy could have made other plans, but couldn't because I waited to the last minute. He said I think I'm the only person who matters in the world, and I put him also in the position of needing to console Amy b/c she was upset, which was inconsiderate to him too.

Surprised, I called Amy to ask if she asked him to send this. She said yes, apologized, and said that she did it because it was hard/scary for her to tell me herself that she was upset at me.

I accepted this and hung up, but I felt extremely uncomfortable with it. Yes I understand Amy has those issues, but I have the exact same issues.

So instead of 2 conflict-avoidant people-pleasers having a conversation, which is a bit out of the comfort zone for both, but they know each other well and trust each other, she send in her husband. Then I have to have the same conversation, but with someone that thrives on conflict and is 100x more aggressive about it. I don't have a conflict-thriving proxy of my own that I could send instead of me. Her doing this seemed extremely unfair.

So, I decided to cut contact. Since then, Amy hasn't messaged me but her husband has, berating me about hurting her until I blocked him.",0
"I work in the film industry in LA as a Production assistant on big budget shoots and as a cam-op/editor and many other roles on low budget productions.  

I’ve been doing PA work, creating videos for up and coming artists, small companies and working on low budget films for about 2 years since I graduated from film school. 

Ive been waiting for a big break in my career and had my shot at that ruined by family members yesterday. I was at my family’s house where my moms side of the family was with us for dinner. My phone was snatched out of my hands so my 9 year old cousin could play games and not bug the people cooking.  I was told to deal with it and I reluctantly agreed to avoid an argument.  


10 minutes later I heard my phone blowing up with texts and a FaceTime started coming in but my cousin immediately declined the call. I told him to give it back but he refused and ran to the bathroom and locked the door.  

I knocked on the bathroom door and kept pounding harder as he refused to open it. My mom told me to relax but that only pissed me off because I literally had my property stolen from me to entertain a child while I was receiving calls.

I hoped to god that it wasn’t anyone important but Lo and behold when he came out and I snatched it back from him (not without him whining “hEeeEyYyyY”) it turned out to be the manager of a major artist I met and shown some of my work trying to reach out asking if I could shoot an impromptu video for this major artist that night. 

I tried to call him back but he texted me they found someone else. 

At this point I was so angry and confronted them. 

The conversation went like this 

Me: Hey remember how I told you I met (artists name) manager at a party last week? 

Mom: Yeah, and? 

Me: Well he was just trying to call me but I was denied access to my phone because it was stolen from me and locked away to entertain (cousin) 

Aunt: Oh come on I really doubt he was trying to reach out to you, there’s thousands of people who do your job in LA but he called you over all of them? 

Me: Actually he was and he did reach out to me over all of them. I’d show you the call log and texts but your inability to parent your child is making me wonder if you also have an inability to read

I was called disrespectful and told to apologize. I snapped and screamed “WHEN I TELL SOMEONE TO GIVE ME MY PHONE, THAT MEANS GIVE ME MY GODDAMN PHONE RIGHT NOW!!! I OWN IT, I PAY FOR IT, I USE IT TO COMMUNICATE WITH FRIENDS WITH AND FOR WORK. IT IS FOR ME, NOT FOR A CHILD TO USE SO HIS MOTHER AND AUNT DONT HAVE TO DEAL WITH HIM!! YOU JUST COST ME A BIG OPPORTUNITY THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING AT FOR YEARS BECAUSE OF YOUR LAZINESS AND THIS KID’S ENTITLEMENT. ” 

By the end of my rant my cousin was crying, my mom and aunt were looking at me wide eyed and jaws hanging. I was told by my mom to get out and not come back until I was ready to apologize to everyone 

Thing is I don’t plan on apologizing so I guess I won’t be going to see family at that house anymore.

"Whenever I make food, breakfast, dinner, whatever, I always ask if he wants any too. Whenever he makes food, he never does. We live together, and in the mornings he gets up a little earlier than me, and as soon as he gets up he usually starts cooking himself breakfast that smells amazing, and the smell of it wakes me up. But when I walk into the kitchen, he's plating himself breakfast without offering me any. Never ever offers me anything. I think it's a bit rude and I would expect him to offer me food when he makes it, at least sometimes. When I wake up earlier then I make breakfast for the two of us, and serve it to him in bed. So am I the asshole for expecting this?

EDIT: I've spoken to him about this before and told him that I feel like it's rude not to offer someone something you're making and I asked if he would offer me things he's cooking, and that I won't say yes all the time but I think it would be at least polite to ask. Since then he started offering sometimes with food he knows I don't like for dinner, and only when I'm standing right there next to him. Since the conversation, he's never offered me breakfast as I'm usually still sleeping when he's cooking, and never just made me any anyway for when I wake up without asking.

When he hasn't offered me breakfast and I walk into the kitchen and ask if I can have some, he says no as there's not enough.

Sometimes when we'll have someone at our house casually, and he'll be cooking himself dinner whilst they are there (we live in an open plan so they can see him cooking) he won't even offer them any of what he's cooking, and I feel like that's extremely rude.",0
"My in-laws have a tradition where they invite the entire family for a free two-week vacation to their native country. After I married my husband, they wanted our families to be close, so they began inviting my family along too and funding it.

My husband and I have been separated for 8 months. Our families only found out 2 months ago, but they all assume we will work things out. So, my MIL made a group chat to plan the family holiday. I assumed she had added me as a mistake, so I left but she kept repeatedly adding me back and eventually my SIL called me out on constantly leaving. I informed them that I wouldn’t be joining in and I privately asked my family to also leave the chat. They refused to and instead, everyone started hounding me in the group chat. 

They were laying on the guilt trip thick and I probably would’ve given in if my SIL and sister didn’t drag my husband, who had been silent until then, into it. 

He said: “It’s fine. I doubt \[my name\] can keep this charade up until August but if it helps, I promise to stay on the opposite end of the house at all times”. 

I haven’t spoken to or seen my husband in 8 months. So, his message just infuriated me. I sent a very long and very rude message back. At one point I wrote that this family holiday was a sham because we weren’t family anymore. Then I left the group chat before anyone could respond. I didn’t get added back again but I did get a message from my sister who said my MIL had removed all of my family after formally uninviting them from the holiday. My sister is devastated because her long-distance boyfriend lives where we were going to be staying so this was her chance to finally see him in person again. My parents are mad at me because they felt like I had embarrassed them and ruined their friendship with my in-laws. My in-laws are upset/hurt with me for the family comment. 

So, AITA?",0
"This is a weird title but here's what actually happened. My ex and I broke up 5 years ago after a year-long relationship, he broke up with me and I took it very hard back then. I can't say I did anything crazy, aside from a few weeks after the break up getting really drunk on a night out and sending him some embarrassing texts. It was the worst heartbreak I've ever had, and it didn't help that he kept messaging me to be ""friends"" even though I tried to set boundaries and say I need space to heal. 

Anyways, that's all in the past. I can confidently say that I have indeed healed from that and am over him. He recently got married to a girl he started dating like 2 months after we broke up. Honestly, I'm happy for him. Good for them. Me, on the other hand, I've dated since then but haven't been able to find anyone worth marrying; I haven't even had another serious relationship since him. 

He's still in the periphery of my social circle, because we still have a lot of mutual friends from uni. And sometimes I see both of them in social settings. While he and I have buried the hatchet and usually just chat when we happen to be in the same room for a bit (although we never text or meet up outside of these contexts), his wife and I have always treated each other with polite disinterest. I know she really doesn't like me. An important note about her is that she's been unemployed for a loooong time. Idk if its because she wants to be a stay-at-home-wife (completely valid choice if that's her thing!) or because she's been unable to find work, but she hasn't worked in many years despite having a masters degree. I've been really able to advance in my career in the past 5 years, and I'm quite far ahead in my field for someone my age and I'm very proud of myself because I worked extremely hard. 

Anyways here's the issue: the other day a bunch of people went for drinks. I came. They were both there. We were all sitting at the same table in a bar. Someone I haven't seen in awhile asked me if I'm dating anyone. I replied ""no, not right now."" My ex's wife quickly made a snark comment ""aw it's okay, some people just stay single"" in front of everyone, like 10 of our friends.  Without missing a beat, I blurted out ""yeah just like some people are meant to stay unemployed"". 

She got really upset, cried and left. Her husband messaged me that I should apologize to her for embarrassing her. I said I will if she apologizes first. He said she refused because what I said was worse, apparently.

"I have a friend, fake name Abby, who wanted to learn nail art/tech as a hobby (not professionally), so about eight months ago she bought the stuff and started to learn off youtube. Me and some other friends supported her and let her try things on our hands. As a result, we walked around with some incredibly wonky acrylics and questionable nail art for a while, in the early months of her hobby.

Now one our friends, fake name Bella, wouldn't let Abby do anything on her nails because 'You're not good at it and I don't want ugly nails'. Abby respected her and didn't ask her again.

Well, fast forward eight months and Abby has gotten good at it. Really good. And all of us are now getting free nails from her, very beautiful ones at that. This is wonderful, because nail salons are shut in our area because of... a certain virus.

Bella has now asked Abby to do her nails, for free, because Abby does our other friends' nails for free. Abby refuses and says since Bella wasn't going to support her earlier, she can't reap the rewards now. Abby says she'll do Bella's nails if Bella pays her the average rate for a set of acrylics, to which Bella threw a small fit.

All of us support Abby on this. I'm pretty sure there's a folk tale about a rabbit and some bread or something that basically sums this up.

Bella has blocked Abby and is texting all of us repeatedly to block Abby as well. I get that Bella might think this is unfair , as I understand not wanting to have ugly nails and feeling left out when everyone else gets nice ones... AITA for siding with Abby and excluding Bella? Or is Abby being mean and petty?

Edit : For those of you asking, we have all started paying to cover the products and materials used! We've tried to pay more, but Abby refuses to take enough to make a profit for herself - she is photographing every design and adding them to her art and textiles portfolio for her GCSEs though, so she is getting something out of it.",0
"B4 u say anything, let me give context. Sorry it’s kinda long

I (18M) am currently a university student from and studying in the US. I purposely chose a school that was far from the place that I grew up. Part of it was beca I wanted to be farther from my parents (not because they were bad, they’re amazing, just want to be a little more independent), and another reason is because I hate the area that I grew up.

Throughout school I really struggled making friends, and it feels like those friends only talk to me when they want something. I also rarely went out(never got invited to parties), and got bullied a lot. And even writhing the place I grew up in, there isn’t really that much to do, especially by yourself. 

When I finally left the state I was really happy because for the first time, I met friends who wanted to hang out with me, who checked up on me, and I just liked the environment a lot more. I am currently back home for winter break, and I just feel depressed. I don’t feel motivated to do any work (not like I have much tho), I have no one to really hang out with (most of the few friends I have r back to school), and I just feel sad and bored. My parents (mainly mom) noticed my demeanor and asked me if I was ok and I told them that I hate being here, and they subtly shamed me because “you grew up here” and “do you not want to see us anymore?”

 Obviously I do but I also see them all the time since they’ve visited several weekends, 3rd break here, and we call every day (this paragraph is kinda irrelevant since they Ik I like seeing them and have agreed to tone down visits so I can act like a college student). 

Another point of contention is my sister’s birthday which is right after spring break. I already hate the environment but.they also want me to come 2 weekends pretty much back to back, and I hate this idea so much.

Idk I just to vent and ask random internet strangers if I’m acting entitled for even feeling this way? AITA since they are kind of upset after finding out how I’m feeling? And WIBTA if I skipped coming for either spring or sister’s birthday?

Edit: Ok, perhaps I need to elaborate, I said I hate the city and the environment, not the house. And I did actually say I something about missing the city and the ppl there and the reaction is still what I described.",0
"My (19F) best friend (20F) told me yesterday that she wants us to start going to a meeting after church where young catholics meet each other and discuss the Bible. She said she wants us to go to meet a potential boyfriend. I have no interest in that, since I’m not straight. 

Also, when I clicked on the group’s Instagram page, one of the first things I see is a prominent alt-right internet personality. He’s a very big meme in Brazil, known for having crazy political views (maybe other Brazilians will know who I’m talking about). 

I said I wasn’t that thrilled about going to this meeting but she kept pushing me so I just accidentally spat out that I’m not even religious anymore. 

I said that I’m unsure about the existence of God, making me agnostic. Actually I don’t necessarily believe that God is real, but I openly admit that I could be wrong. 

She looked at me like I was insane and started a two hour rant about why we must have faith, that life must have a meaning, that I’m not going to heaven, that there is “evidence” of God, etc. 

After that I was just very pissed of. We were supposed to hang out this weekend and then go to the catholic meeting but I don’t even want to go our hang out in the first place. 

AITA for dismissing something that’s very important to my best friend and simply refusing to go? ",0
"Long story short I’ve had (still have) a good career in something computer related. It is a well-paying field and squee I’m a hashtag woman in stem. How progressive. My mom is a 70s feminist. 

My husband loves the payscale. 

Most of my friends either don’t work outside the home or hate their jobs (the latter group has good careers). 

Me, I have never been OBSESSED with technology, like I’m “supposed” to be. I just do this to pay my bills and raise my kids. I’m somewhere between “smug that I got X done and look good” to unfulfilled and feeling cooped up in a cube. 

The problem is that after a compendium of life changes (largely bad) I’ve had some revelations that I’m living my life for other people. 

While recovering from major surgery I started writing a children’s book and... I got interest from a literary agent! She’s shopping it around to publishers as we speak. I’ve won a couple awards for the manuscript from people in the industry who know what they’re talking about. 

Writing is when I feel alive and happiest. It isn’t work to me. I understand that you have to sell about 10+ books for you not to need a day job anymore but pulling late nights to write or edit isn’t a sacrifice. 

My family & friends are somewhere between furious at the time I’m “wasting”/“stealing” from my kids and employer and laughing at how I’m chasing a “pipe dream.” None have read a word
I’ve written but insist my books “suck”. 

Oddly, the only outlier is my black-sheep eccentric aunt who... works in a different publishing vertical. She’s read my manuscript and thinks it’s strong. 

Nobody else has read my stuff. But they’re using  buzzwords like “delusional” and “PLEASE get professional help.”

To me, it looks like they’re trying to gatekeep me out of feeling fulfilled and don’t know wtf they’re talking about. Given that I am still pulling in a 6-figure salary and benefits, taking care of my kids, and clearly my writing has teeth, I think they need to back the fuck off and find something better to do. 

Who’s the asshole?",0
"Throw away account
Context: I 18f am mixed (my Mom is Scottish and Dad is Hispanic / Latino.) I inherited my Mom's skin colour. In other words I'm very fair skinned. I am also queer.

This years I took an African history course. Our first unit was about culture and we were told that as white people (aside from my mixedness there are two black people in this class) we didn't always talk about our culture. We were asked to bring something from our culture to the class. I struggled thinking of something as a mixed person, like should I bring something from my Mom's culture or my Dad's? I expressed this a friend in the class and my teacher cut in saying that I didn't have to focus on race and looked increasingly annoyed when I bounced idea's for what I'd bring in of my friend. Which was strange but I forgot, actually I forgot so much that I didn't get anything until the last second. I grabbed a Día de Muertos decoration. For those who don't know Día de Muertos is a Mexican holiday celebrating loved ones that have died. I explained all this. She made a strange comment about the validity of my Dad's race and moved on and had asked all the other people lots of questions about their culture (except me.) Now this seemed strange but I was nothing compared to the strange things she did involving African history. We did a unit on pre colonel African at the end of the unit we were meant to watch a movie in relation  to the unit. For the end of the pre colonial Africa (kingdom like ancent Egypt) unit, we watched a movie on cave men. Then she kept saying one of the n-words, the one thats like black in Spanish. She was quoting this bit it felt unnecessary. She is not black. Had us say what we would do if we were slaves. She is not black, she is white. I feel like many of the things she's said are inappropriate. But I fear getting her in trouble. I live in a very conservative area and though my parents are very excepting, most queer kids in the school aren't so lucky. My African history teacher is the leader of the gsa and is important to many of the queer kids in the school. I don't want mess things up but I feel like I should say something to the school.

So would I be the A-hole if I complained about my teacher to the school?",0
"Uh basically title I guess. My sister has a habit of saying ""you know what really gets my goat"", she probly says it 7/8 times a day. So like that tumblr post i taught my niece to say ""el chupacabra"" when her mom says it (it sounds more like ""eh supacaba"" tho cause shes four but its adorable). I told my niece it was a monster from Mexico that eats goats and she didnt seem scared or anything, probly cause the only monster she knows is cookie monster, but apparently now my niece walks around the house saying ""el chupacabra!"" all day and now my sister & brother in law are mad at me for teaching her this, but imo its kind of adorable and also harmless?? But like shes my sisters kid so idk.",0
"I got married recently, my mum basically wanted to make the day just as much about her as possible.  Honestly, I lost count of the number of times I heard “well I am the mother of the bride!” She kept moaning that the mother of the bride doesn’t have a role in the wedding. 

Leading up to the wedding she told me she was going shopping for a mother of the bride dress and she sent me a picture of a floor length ivory, lacy dress that she wanted to buy for the wedding.  I text her back saying it looked like a wedding dress and that she couldn’t wear it (my wedding dress was ivory). She got very defensive saying that she “is the mother of the bride” she needed to stand out too. I told her yes the mother of the bride is important but she can’t wear white. I explained what I thought was a well known rule that no one except the bride (and the flower girls) could should wear white to a wedding. 

In the end I text my dad for help who also involved mums close friend. They went shopping with her and when she showed them the dress she liked they both said “ you can’t wear that! It’s basically a wedding dress”.  She told them she had never heard of the unwritten rule about not wearing white to someone’s wedding, and that she wanted to stand out too. 

She was not happy with me for speaking to my dad behind her back and grudgingly picked a different dress. But she feels that I was being a bridezilla for dictating what she wears. 

So AITA for telling her not to wear white/ivory to my wedding?


EDIT. Thank you all for the comments, it seems the majority think I am NTA.  But to answer a few questions:
Yes she did have a role in the wedding, she signed the witness book, walked down the aisle first with the flower girls as they were young and scared to go down alone. I said she could do a speech as well if she wanted but she declined.  There were other things too. 

Yes the wedding is over and she didn’t end up wearing a white or ivory dress, her dress was white with red flowers with a bright red hat and I just decided to pick my battles. 

Finally for the person who said that I am dragging this up after the wedding is over and IATA for not letting it go, she keeps bringing it up saying I was a bridezilla for not letting her choose her outfit and that I wanted all the attention on me.  It had me doubting myself as my sister also agreed with her. None of my other friends and family thing I was a bridezilla and all said they had a smashing time at the wedding.  The day was about my husband and I, I do not crave the spotlight at all. My primary concern was what people would say about her and too her on the day.",0
"I had a very good friend from university, N, who I always helped out with university-related work, but also always lent my ear to him whenever he had to vent his frustrations or woes about anything from family problems to issues in his love life. He said he considers me like a brother and cares about me very much.

Due to the current world circumstances, the university is online, and we had an oral exam where the teachers ask each of us a question, and we answer it. When it was my friend, N's turn, he didn't know the answer to his question. Although he technically finished with his examination, he still stayed in the classroom to meet for whatever reason. Once it was my turn to answer, the teacher asked me a question, to which N wrote in chat "" I know the answer to that!"". The teacher appointed him to answer it but did not give me another question, so I could only add little bits to N's answer. I was pissed off about it because he did basically took away my chance to answer, and bumped up his own grade at my expense. I did not say anything but he messaged me afterwards saying that we ' did a nice switch"". I told him I don't agree and that I think what he did was very rude, inappropriate, and selfish. I told him he shouldn't have told the teacher he knows the answer in the first place. He tried to convenience me more that what he did was not wrong, and he told me to ""stop because I'm making him feel bad"".

This really pissed me off because I felt like at this point, he was just trying to make me feel guilty He went on a long rant about how he wants to die and he'll never get attached to anybody anymore, how he's tired of all of this and he never wanted this. I told him that he's being selfish and egoistic because even when his actions and their consequences hurt me and made me upset, he still only wanted me to stop being upset because it's making HIM upset, not because he realised he overstepped a boundary. And how at this point he's still talking about how stressed out HE is, without taking into consideration how I feel. We haven't talked since. I discussed this issue with some of my close friends who are also our classmates and they told me that what he's doing is manipulative, gaslighting and that he's toxic, and his behaviour is unacceptable. They said that I shouldn't feel guilty for putting my feelings first and not catering to his whenever he wants me to, as soon as he wants me to. I and N haven't talked since then and I feel guilty about not being there for him when he needed me, even though I was upset with him and not feeling too happy either.

I might be the asshole because I'm overreacting and making this a bigger issue than it actually is, but I feel like my friends are right and he's just trying to make me feel guilty. So, AITA?",0
"I (22M) was raised in a highly religious household. I knew I was gay when I was twelve, and it was the most terrifying realization of my life. I knew, with absolute certainty, that every single person of importance in my life would hate me if they found out. 

When I was 16, I entered an online relationship with a boy I met through Tumblr. We never met in real life, but he was one of the first people I spoke to honestly about my sexuality. One day, my little sister (then 13F, now 19F) asked me if she could borrow my computer (I got my computer when I started high school, so she didn't have one of her own yet). I was usually very anal about clearing my internet history, but I didn't think my sister was gonna do much other than poke around Youtube, so I just let her have it. Unfortunately, my email was open, and she noticed that I'd received a notification about a message my bf had sent me on Tumblr. She read it.

She immediately told me that she had to tell mom and dad ""that their son was a sinner."" I begged and begged and begged her not to – literally on my knees, crying – but she insisted that mom and dad deserved to know, so she went downstairs and told them. Long story short, I spent the next year in a conversion therapy program before finally having a huge blowout with my father and getting kicked out of the house. I haven't spoken to my parents since. I spent almost a year homeless (though I am, luckily, doing much better now).

Three months ago, I got a Facebook message from my little sister. She told me that she's thought a lot about what she did all those years ago, and that she hopes for us to reconnect. At first, I had a lot of difficulty responding to her message, but after some encouragement from a few friends of mine, I finally got back to her. I asked her what she was up to, and what she meant by ""thinking about"" what she'd done.

She responded by saying that she'd just started her sophomore year of college, and that she was doing really well, but that going to college had given her a new perspective on LGBT issues, which was why she'd finally questioned whether she was right to tell our parents about me. She said she was sorry, and that she hoped I could forgive her.

I don't think I can, though? For one thing, like... she's just now realizing she was wrong? After she literally watched me get abused for a year then kicked out? Plus, I just can't reconcile the fact that she's still close with our parents, who are sending her to a great school and giving her such a wonderful life. It's just not fair.

I told her I don't think we can have a relationship. She responded that she ""hopes I change my mind.""

My friends say that I'm being petty, that she was just a child when she outed me, that I should give her the opportunity to make amends, and that I'm taking out my anger at our parents on her. But I think I have a right to set the boundaries that I need.

AITA?",0
"So I (22f) live with my partner (25m) on my mother's house with my two brothers (30 and 25). Let me explain real quick. My mother's house is a two floor house. My two brothers live upstairs and the stairs are outside so basically the house is divided. My brother (30), let's call him Jay, comes downstairs and goes straight up to the kitchen. Mind you, I'm on the living room which is connected to the kitchen so I can see everything he is doing. He starts taking out some food and stuff without saying anything so I asked him what he was doing and he said ""well I'm looking for food"" so I asked him if they didn't had food upstairs and he said ""I don't take anything from him"" (referring to our other brother cause they have a difficult relationship). I reply ""ok but at least you could've just asked first"" and with the most serious look on his face he said ""I don't have to ask anything"" which I reply with a shocking and confused face ""uh yes you have to cause I don't live alone here and I don't buy food for all the house"". He starts questioning me since when he has to ask for food so I reply ""since I started living with my bf and buy my own food?"" At this point I'm confused af cause I think this is pretty much common sense. He keeps arguing that he is not like our other brother that he doesn't want anyone taking his food or stuff so that I don't have to be comparing. I said ""I'm not comparing, I'm just saying that I don't live alone here and this is the food I buy so yes you have to ask for it"". Mind you, I told him since the beginning that I don't mind giving him food I just wanted him to at least ask me first that was all. He kept arguing and asking angry if I was seriously fighting over some food. I again told him that I wasn't fighting over the food I just wanted to be respected on my own place and wanted him to just ask first. At the end, he put everything back and left all angry throwing things on his way. So AITA for doing that? Honestly, I don't think I'm wrong for putting boundaries on my things that not he or anybody else helps me buy. 

PD: He owns me $10 bucks for the power of the house that I had to pay before they took the power off because he was too late to pay his part. And I didn't even mention that to him.",0
"Context : Me, my wife and our 1 year old boy are going to Florida with my family (my dad, my sister and her boyfriend) for our vacations this summer. That makes 6 of us.

  
Here's how we're all getting there and back : 

* My dad is going there by car for a month and coming back by car.
* Me, my wife and baby are going by plane and coming back by plane 2 weeks later.
* My sister and her boyfriend are going by plane with us and coming back by car with my dad.

&#x200B;

Now, since there are 6 of us, they told me, during my son's 1st birthday (which took me by surprise and pissed me off as it got me thinking about this instead of focusing fully on my son), that we would be taking my car for the trip since it has 7 seats and theirs only have 5.   


  
I wasn't thrilled by the idea for the following main reasons : 

* insurance concerns since someone else would be driving my car for an extended period of time
* theft concerns since our car is a brand new Highlander (one of the most stolen cars)
* car costs for about 8 000 km (depreciation, maintenance, etc.)
* not having our main car (we have 2) for 2 weeks prior
* us having to pay more than the rest of the family since they would all save on plane tickets except us  


&#x200B;

After consideration, I suggested that we could take my car and that each of them would give me 100$ to help cover for a portion of the costs, which would still be way cheaper than renting a car. It doesn't even cover the car costs and me and my wife would still be paying more than the rest of them for traveling but it would help a bit.

  
To this, my sister and my dad said I was ridiculous and cheap and that my sister wouldn't hesitate to do it for free if she was me (easier to say since she benefits from it by saving on plane tickets).  


AITA?

"Earlier today my mom and I(17F) were talking about family and how they're somewhat responsible for each other, and then she brought up the fact that my brother(7) and I will have 50/50 responsibility of my disabled sister(4, has cerebral palsy and we don't know if she will walk or speak) when they're too old to take care of her. She even said that my sister will probably live with one of us.
I told her I disagreed with that and I don't think it's fair, and she answered by saying that it's not fair to anyone.

My relationship with my sister is very close to none. I live with my parents (I'm still in high school) and only really spend time with her when they are too busy because she has to have someone with her 24/7 or else she can fall and break something. In a few years I'm going to college probably outside of the country and will be in even less contact with my sister. 

My dad also ""shames"" me by saying that my sister won't have anyone and won't be able to do anything by herself and that I need to do well in school for *her*.

I find that ridiculous.

I'm studying for myself, to reach *my* goals. I can't even tell him that because he's extremely stubborn and never changes opinion about anything.

TL;DR
My mom said that my brother and i have to have responsibility for my disabled sister when they get too old. I don't agree with that, and think everyone should live their own lives.

EDIT (Some Info):
- I haven't told my parents and I don't plan to right now
- My sister has a trust fund given by the government, which they occasionally take money out of when they can't afford to pay the bills (because covid really fucked them)
- I completely agree with all the ""NAH"" because I absolutely do *not* think my mom is an asshole and I know she only wants the best for us. I'm open to helping my sister but to a point; I wouldn't let her live with me, as I think she would be better off having her own space with her own caregiver rather than living with her sister and not having her space at all.
- My parents did not choose to have a disabled daughter. She was born prematurely at 23 weeks.

EDIT2:
For the people commenting on my username, I'm not going to respond because of rule 12. But also, can we stop *treating* the ""R-slur"" as a slur? It was a derogatory synonym of stupid used against disabled people. Can we evolve as a civilization and stop correlating it to disabled people? Its honestly that simple to end the derogatory background of a word.",0
I (19f) go to university and live in residence. My neighbour (around 18/19nb) keeps getting drunk every night for about a week and goes on loud rants about their hairdresser and being a “former gifted kid” to their roommates (all about 18/19f) who egg them on and one time got drunk too. My roommate (20nb) and I have told them to please be quiet many times because we are trying to study or sleep.  They didn’t listen and kept getting drunk anyway and I have no idea whether we should file a complaint against them or not because they told us while sobbing and drunk that they can’t lose their university education because their major is their dream job. My roommate says that if our neighbour annoys us one more time when drunk they and I will file a complaint to RA. WIBTA for the complaint.,0
"This isn't the first time this has happened.

&#x200B;

I (20F) live alone with my mom (48F). Yesterday the two of us went out for dinner. I wasn't very hungry so I quite literally brought home an entire chicken sandwich since the only thing I ate was my fries and some of the appetizer. It was a pretty big sandwich so it was $12. I told her I was full but that I would definitely be enjoying it for dinner tomorrow and we laughed about it.

Today I came home from work and went to heat up my chicken sandwich and noticed that more than half of it was gone. I hadn't touched it at all yet. I asked my mom, and she nonchalantly told me she gave it to my sister when she dropped off my nephew this morning. I asked her why as I had planned on eating it for dinner, and she shrugged and said ""she probably didn't pack herself a lunch."" 

Maybe I'm overreacting but this really pissed me off, especially because she's done this multiple times before. She's offered my leftover food that \*I\* PAID FOR, to her boyfriend and several of his friends, and has also given my leftovers to my sister before without asking as well. Last time this happened, I talked to my sister about it, and she told me that my mom had lied to her and told her that I was the one who told her to give it to her.

I snapped at my mom and told her she shouldn't touch my food without asking, unless she plans on getting something to replacement or making something for dinner. She told me it was just food and that I probably wouldn't have eaten it anyway since I've forgotten about leftovers in the past, and to stop overreacting, but I don't think I'm overreacting. Maybe it's trivial but it's ridiculous. Would she have done the same if it was my sister's food? 

(P.S. Before anyone tells me to just move out, that is not currently an option for several reasons right now. I'm disabled and can only work a certain amount of hours a week and also cannot drive yet due to my disability.)

TL;DR: AITA for yelling at/arguing with my mom over her giving my leftover food away without asking?",0
"  Info- I live in Quebec, Canada. CEGEP is similar to college, a place to continue education after high school. 

 I (F16) am moving out in June. I live in a small town where there are no cegeps so I’m going into the city ≈1-2 hours away. I’ve been working 32hrs a week for the past six months to make as much money as possible to prepare. My rent is a little over 600 a month and I already paid the deposit.

  Here’s the thing. I’m only 16… I go to school all day so I can’t just work all day everyday even if I wanted to… In cegep I’m going to be studying in Nursing and i know this is gonna be difficult which means I’ll be working even LESS. But my mom doesn’t and has no wanted to help me with my living expenses or with money in general. 

  I thought I was lucky that she agreed to pay for my school fees but in Quebec it’s really not expensive.. and it’s also normal for parents to pay for their kids schooling here. I tried to apply for bursaries to help me but my combined family income is too high for me to be elligible. Which I think is dumb for the reason that no one is actually helping me with money… anyways I’ve been looking into it and I found out that I’m legally allowed to ask my mom for an ‘allowance’ as long as I’m at school, and ESPECIALLY because I’m a minor. Would it be selfish if I turned it into a legal thing? 

  I was trying to just forget about it and figure it out on my own but I don’t want to stuff myself full of debt at sixteen and I’m really getting panicked and stressed out that I’m going to struggle too much and not do well in school or even ruin the beginning of my independent life.


TL;DR my mom doesn’t want to financial assist me at all even though ’m a minor. I want to take legal action to atleast get a little bit of help.",0
"AITA for wanting my bf to cook after he invited more people than planned?

My (23F) boyfriend (25M) and I were supposed to host a dinner for us and another couple we met on vacation tomorrow. I’m supposed to be in charge of the cooking. 

2 days ago, before going to work, my boyfriend tells me that he forgot to tell me that he invited our neighbors and their 3 children. I was kinda annoyed he didn’t asked me first but whatever, I said okay, next time,ask me if I’m okay with it first.

After coming home from work the same day, he tells me that he invited two of his colleagues and that they’ll come with their wives and kids. They have one kid each so that’ll make 2 more children. 

I got upset when he told me this because 1. He invited 6 more people without asking me first, again, and 2. He told me that I needed to make a different dish for his colleagues’s kids because they won’t like what I’m planning to cook. 

I told my boyfriend that he needed to be the one cooking because I didn’t want to anymore. He asks me why as I initially agreed to cook. 

I said I initially agreed to cook for 4 people not 15. I added that it’ll be easier for him to cook for 15 people anyways because he has his whole afternoon free while I’d be working until 4pm. 

My boyfriend doesn’t agree tho and thinks it’s unfair of me to have agreed to cook just to take it back last minute. 

I said I’d be okay to help with the kids’ food once I come back from work but he needed to do the rest.

He doesn’t want to and even threatened to cancel the whole thing if I wasn’t cooking. 

Am I the AH there? Should I be the one cooking still as I was supposed to cook from the beginning? Or is it only fair that he cooks for the additional 11 people he invited?",0
"
This story happened almost a year back and when I told my friends about this, they said I should post it here because they were split 50/50.

So I 19M moved out of my parents house about a year ago. There was nothing wrong in my life, I had a good upbringing, I loved being home, I had a lot of friends and my parents were loving. Or so I thought. 

Anyways, I was going to have a big 18th birthday as it is the legal age where I stay (Australia) and means you go from boy to man. Child to adult. I had a venue rented out and I had family and friends coming from all over to celebrate with me. We had a blast that night. I had my first drink and almost made it my last, I don’t remember anything from that night but from the photos I seen, it looked like I had a good night so I was happy.

A few days after that night, my parents sat me down to have a talk. They told me that I’m a man now and that I’ve been working a lot of hours and yet they haven’t received anything. They told me that as soon as I started working, they expected me to help pay rent. Obviously I didn’t know any of that because I didn’t get told. They told me that I should’ve known better, but now that I’m 18, they expect me to help me with rent. 

Honestly I didn’t mind helping them if they asked. I was 16 when I got my first job at McDonald’s and am now working in construction. But they made it seem like I was in the wrong for not giving them money. And I get where they are coming from but from a young’s boys perspective, all I saw was green. All I saw was a triple digit pay check that I wanted to spend straight away. 

Anyways I told them I’d start helping them from now on but it wasn’t good enough for them. They told me that I had to pay them back all the money that I should’ve given them when I first started working which was almost 10K. I said no flat out and they got mad. They told me that either I pay rent and pay them back what they are owed or I move out and find my own place.

So that’s what I did. I moved out a few days after to my friends house for a bit, until I found my own apartment and have been living here for about 8-10 months. As soon as I moved out i got bombarded with calls and texts saying that I disrespected by not paying them what they owe and making it harder for them to live now that they don’t have someone washing or doing their laundry, taking out their rubbish and all those little stuff. They are both in their early 40s and more than capable of doing it. 

My friends asked me why I never introduced them to my parents and told them what I’ve told you. Some of them already hated my parents and some of them said that it was my duty as their son. I honestly didn’t know I had to give them money or help out. I would’ve if they asked but I feel like they just disrespected and tried to gaslight me into giving them money. I just need to know if ITA or not

EDIT - A lot of people have asked me what my cultural background is and if it has something to do with my situation. My mother is from Chile and My dad is Samoa. As I know of, both cultures do expect help, but mostly in the form of chores and keeping the house clean. It isn’t until you’re 18 and still living there that you are expected to pay rent. I do have siblings and they had jobs before they were 18 too, they were never made to pay rent before they were 18 nor did my parents ask for backdated rent. Just wanted to clear up the air with some frequently asked questions.

EDIT 2 - As some of you pointed out, it is too my better judgement that I should’ve helped out without having to be told. I will take that as a fault of mine. But what I won’t accept and can now clearly see that backdating rent to a minor which is already bad in itself will never be acceptable and I stand firm on my decision of not paying and moving out. I do however have a family dinner in a few days with my parents and siblings so if anyone wants an update after that then I’ll be happy to make one. Thank you all for the help and support. It makes me happy knowing that I made the right choice and to have unbiased opinions on this matter <3",0
"Before the pandemic I (29F) joined a women's support group consisting of eight members. We have a few certain rules and fundamental beliefs that are clearly laid out we won't deviate from, but for the most part we're a general women's support group with women from many walks of life. All are mothers except myself and one other member: We are both happily childfree.  

I don't hate kids by any means, and it's been my observation mothers get the short of the end of the stick a lot, so I don't have any qualms how often the topic of conversation veers into the mothers venting about that and all that goes with it. Janet is my age with three kids and does this often. Again, not a problem. 

But during our weekly meet-up on Sunday, now held via Zoom due to COVID, Janet and another member started discussing how having children is something women have a ""natural instinct"" for, and that it's ""like a primal urge"" and ""saying otherwise is deluding yourself."" They were seemingly speaking generally, but me and the other childfree member still took issue with this. We both agreed out loud Janet was likely projecting onto us because she sometimes questioned her own decisions. 

Things got ugly from there. Janet disconnected and the group lead said that we should all take a break for the week. 

Earlier today, the lead contacted me and said that the rest of the group had voted me and the other childfree member off the island for a two week ban. Her reasoning was we had ""lifestyle shamed"" Janet. She went onto explain what Janet was actually saying was that childfree women should be allowed to change their mind about having children without being shamed. Had Janet said that, I would have agreed, but she didn't. 

I told the lead that I was not interested in re-joining. The other childfree member is upset as this has been her main social circle for nearly a year, and is now saying we were too harsh and should ask Janet for forgiveness to gain entry back into the group. I don't think we should, and that there are other groups we could join for socializing, but am I being an asshole?",0
AITA for this not enthusiastic about receiving a plant and stuffed bear from my partner? 2 weeks ago I attempted to break up with my partner. Over the last year we had a rough go of it. I realized most of our time was based on their time and I wasn’t being considered a lot of the time. Many times my wants and needs were put to the side for their sake. After trying couples therapy and individual therapy I started disconnecting still. I waiting for change and some changes were made but I was still feeling like what I wanted and needed did not matter. So after time I started choosing myself and I couldn’t shake the feeling of losing feelings towards my partner. I attempted to break up with them twice and we’ve discussed it more after that. We recently went to their therapist office and not mine where we originally started. It felt like they were trying very hard to convince me to give it another shot. I explained how it would be like all the other times and how it feels like if I do this then I’m once again putting my wants and needs aside for my partners sake. Any ways today I come home to a plant and bear on the table. My partner asks me if I notice anything different and I say yes and continue on with getting ready for my gym session after work. They didn’t take my response well..  they were definitely saddened that I was not enthusiastic about this gift. Not that I don’t appreciate it but how am I supposed to feel after the last few weeks we’ve had? So am I the a** h***? This feels like a last ditch effort. This would have been nice to receive during good times and not where we are now.,0
"For context, I was either fifteen or sixteen. The ""incident"" in question happened in a voice call where I supposedly said something along these lines:

>***15/16-year old me had a secret son that I took on camping trips so that I could teach him to throw rocks at birds.***

Obviously, this was some nonsense. It clearly wasn't meant to convince anyone of anything. It was patently absurd, but this one guy in the voice call took it so seriously that he's still angry to this day. We never spoke after this ""incident"". 

Apparently, he thought that I tried to seriously lie to him. A mutual friend told me he's still genuinely angry all these years later, with the specific reason being because ""I said I had a child"", enough so that he still gets huffy when our mutuals mention me.

Mind you, I'm in my early twenties and this guy is in his mid-twenties AFAIK.

So, AITA for supposedly telling this dude the ""lie to end all lies"" as a teenager? To me the whole thing's absurd. I had honestly forgotten this guy existed until I was told that he's still mad at me for this thing.

"Four years ago, my father passed away, leaving his assets to me (now 28) and my brother (35) to divide equally. This included a sum of money, a small family business, and two properties. My brother, seven years my senior and more established with a family, took on the role of managing our father's estate, as I was still completing my studies. He moved from the US back to Colombia with his family to handle the business and proposed to buy out my share.

However, a few months later, he argued that he shouldn't pay me for the business due to his sacrifices in relocating and proposed deducting his and his family’s moving expenses, mortgage payments, and lost income from the estate funds. 

We eventually agreed he would keep the business, we'd split the cash, and he'd retain the larger property while I took the smaller one. He was to pay me the value difference within three years. It's been a year since the agreement and he hasn't made any payments, citing his own financial burdens like student loans. He wants to pay me the whole amount at the end of 3 years with no interest. 

Recently, our mother passed away, leaving her small shop and some savings. He wants to take over her shop, and I've asked to be compensated with our mother's savings as partial payment for what he owes me, along with a structured plan for the remaining amount. AITA for asking this? He argues that as an older sibling, he has consistently supported me in the past, and now it's my turn to help him, given his current financial difficulties due to debt, while I am debt-free.",0
"Me F26 and my husband M29 moved out of our hometown right after we got married, he's very close to his friends that he met from high school. He trys to use every opportunity to see them in person and spend time talking to them.
He heard that 3 of them were visiting our city for 2 days and they wanted to visit him the day before they leave the city. He was so excited. Prepared everything for their visit and stood at the door waiting for them for an hour. They arrived at 4. I made coffee and brought sweets so my husband could spend more time talking to them. Then he suddenly looked at the clock which was 5pm and told me to go upstairs so he could talk to me privately.

My husband freaked out saying he had an important meeting with a client via zoom. And it'd take about 40min for it to be over and asked if I could stay with his guests til then. I reminded him I had an appointment with the doctor at 5:15 and couldn't skip it. He asked me to cancel it and stay with the guests. He didn't even want to hear my response. Just rushed out for his meeting.

I got dressed and went downstairs. I told his guests that my husband had a 40min meeting and I had an important appointment with the dr. Told them they could wait or leave if they didn't want to wait.They chose to leave. And I went to my appointment. In 45 min I got an angry call from him asking why I told his guests to leave instead of sitting with them til he was done with his meeting. Said he missed his friends and wanted to talk to them more. He said I always let him down and act unsupportive although he always entertained my family when they came to visit. Truth is he just loves spending hours talking to my brother cause they share a lot of interests. So he wasn't doing it for me.


He argued about how I was being negative. And how his friends must've felt awful being kicked out like that
He said I could've gone to my appointment 40 minutes later and explained to the doctor. But that's not how doctor appointments work. We argued back and forth, everyone in the waiting room was staring at me because of how loud my husband was talking. til he hung up on me then sent me a text 

With the word selfish in capital letters;S.E.L.F.I.S.H. I just couldn't stay I've waited for a week for my appointment.

I understand he misses his friends but this appointment was important as I've been constantly dealing with an unbelievable pain and needed to see the doctor as soon as possible. I've been on medication but its not doing much. Just sitting in the waiting room is exhausting in itself so it's not like I went out with friends.",0
"The other day I (29m) overslept for work. It was completely my fault; I'd stayed up too late binging a series and slept through my alarm. I'd woken up about 30 minutes later than I should have. There is almost no worse feeling than realizing that you've overslept so I woke up in a panic. I almost immediately called my boss to let him know that I was running late and then began a frantic effort to get ready for work as quickly as possible.

My wife (28f) doesn't always remember day to day when I have to be at work since my starting time varies by a few hours, so she didn't necessarily know that I was running late until I called up to her and told her. As I was about to jump in the shower I yelled up to her and asked her ""Hon; I'm running late. I really need you to quick throw a lunch together for me. Just a sandwich and some fruit and chips and a couple bottles of pop."" She called down ""no"" and I yelled back up ""Please? Just this once help me out?""

Here's the thing; my wife has some weird hangup about packing lunches for me. She grew up in a family where her father always expected her mother to pack his lunch for him and according to her he was kind of entitled about it, so while my wife doesn't mind cooking dinner for me or doing my laundry (not that I always expect it) she just has a problem with packing a lunch for me as it makes her feel like too much of a servant.  I don't totally get it, but it's her thing and it's never been a big deal before the other day.  I just always pack my own lunch.

However, even after asking this one time when I came upstairs I found that my lunch cooler was empty. I looked over at my wife who was just sitting on the couch on her phone and said ""Really?Were you too busy?"" She answered ""Pack your own lunch. It's not my job.""  She only works part time and it absolutely beyond pissed me off to watch her sitting there leisurely scrolling through her phone while she knew I was stressed and scrambling. I just left without a lunch and had to buy food from the vending machine to get me through the day.

When I got home I was still pissed and we got into a huge fight. She told me that I knew her boundary about packing a lunch for me. I told her that she could have put her hangup aside that one time to help me out.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who's taken the time to respond. A few things, just based on questions I'm getting.

1.) We both do housework. I won't say it's completely split down the middle; she probably does more laundry, cooking, and dishes than I do, but I do that stuff fairly often as well and we both clean at about equal rates. I also do more of the yardwork.

2.) People think my wife may have some childhood ""trauma"" about this. I probably didn't explain it well, but it's not nearly to that level. Her father is a decent guy; she'd tell you that herself. It just kind of got under her skin watching her mom always pack his lunch and him not seem to appreciate it much.

3.) I could technically have food delivered there, but given the location and where I am in the building it's just more of a pain than it's worth.

4.) Finally, I understand that it was my fault that I overslept. I'm not blaming anyone else. It's very rare for me, but this one time I just let myself get too caught up in what I was watching. What upset me, though, is that if my wife overslept and were stressed and frantic I would have helped her out in any way possible to get her out the door as fast as possible, even if it would have just saved her two minutes. I wouldn't have sat with my feet up playing videogames and just watched her struggle. That's my side of it, while her's is that she's just not going to ever pack me a lunch and I know that and that's that.

(Probably) last edit. Thanks again to everyone who took the time to comment. I've read all of your comments and have considered all of them, but I'm still just so angry at my wife for not helping me out the one time I really needed her and had begged for her help and I am having a really hard time getting over it. I'm not sure where I go from here. I still feel angry every time I look at her.",0
"My wife and I are going through a divorce and have three kids.  She wants to put in the divorce agreement that we will both pay for a third of our kids' college costs, with the child being responsible for the other third.

She got her bachelors degree without going into debt because her parents helped her pay for her bachelors degree and wants to do the same for our kids.  My parents, for financial reasons, did not help any of their kids with college cost and I paid for all of mine. She feels that it is our moral responsibility, while I feel that it is something nice to do for your kids, but you are not a bad parent if you don't.

Here's the thing. I make good money and **fully intend to help my kids pay for college if they need it**. They are all really smart and get great grades.  Full-ride scholarships are definitely within the realm of possibility.  However, I don't want to be *legally bound* to pay for it. For one, as I said, based on my upbringing, I don't think it is a moral requirement.  **But the main reason is that I have MS.  On the spectrum of how bad you can be affected, I'm way on the good end and it doesn't affect me much. At the moment.  However, there's no way of knowing that a year from now I won't be unable to work, on disability and no longer in a position to pay for college.**

So, AITA or not?

Edited to emphasize a couple of things people seem to keep missing

Edit: For those of you saying I'm a deadbeat dad who just wants to get out of supporting my children. FWIW, I've already agreed to the following:  (STEW=Soon To be Ex Wife)
 * Child support in the amount STEW and her lawyer requested
 * Splitting the cost of a decent used car for each kid when they turn 16 and get their license
 * Paying for medical insurance for the kids
 * Paying for the majority of out of pocket medical expenses for kids
 * Paying for the majority of extra-curricular activities for the kids
 * Providing cell phone service for the kids until they graduate college

INB4 ""kudos, do you want a cookie?"" I'm only posting this because of claims I'm a deadbeat dad, I don't think any of this (except maybe the car and the cell service) is anything beyond the basics of what a parent should do in a divorce.",0
"My husband and I have 3 kids, 9M, 8M, and 3F. The boys have been driving us crazy. They fight like cats and dogs. We’ve had countless talks with them about respecting each other, to no avail. I understand sibling rivalry but it’s gotten to the point it’s disruptive to us all, every day.  
  
I already told my husband last week I wasn’t sure if the vacation was a good idea. My husband shut me down pretty much immediately and things went ahead as planned.  
  
First of all, the 3.5 hour car ride was (predictably) hell. Boys fighting and riling each other up the whole time. Husband and I kept trying to reassure each other that things would be better once we got there and they would be too excited to cause trouble.  
  
We were wrong. They had so many reminders of what not to do once we got to the rental house…so they do everything wrong from the get go.   
  
Shoes on the white furniture? Check. Running in the house? Check. I turned my back for 2 seconds and the 8 y/o threw a box of chalk in the pool to keep his brother from getting it. We went out to lunch and they were out of control in the restaurant. 9M ran away from us in a strange place because he didn’t get his way. 

  
We finally go to the beach and they are frankly being brats. Refusing sunscreen. Fighting over toys. Pushing their luck repeatedly going farther and farther out in the water than we told them to. Cursing.   
  
By the time we got back to the house, it was around dinner time and I was fed up. They were totally ruining it for everybody. Nothing had worked and I told my husband we needed to go home, for the reasons mentioned above, mainly that they needed to see a REAL consequence.  
  
My husband still insisted it would get better. I put my foot down and told him that I didn’t even want to be there at that point so either I was leaving, or we all were. He got super pissed and told me it was ridiculous and unfair to our daughter. I actually agree with him but saw no other choice at this point. Of course when I tell the kids they immediately burst into tears and are begging to stay, promising they will behave.  
  
My mother, who came with us, was also near tears. She thinks her precious grandbabies do no wrong.  She argued with me too, begging me to “just let it go” but I refused to budge. So, we left, less than 24 hours into a 4 day vacation.  
  
Half the ride home was spent with them sobbing and my husband pretty much gave me the silent treatment the whole way. My mother decided to stay behind a little longer but then started randomly texting me about 30 minutes in, asking if I was serious (she knew I was) and told me the whole reason she came was to spend time with the kids, so I had now “ruined it for everybody” and “they’re only little once”.   
  
Here we are the following evening and pretty much no one likes me right now except my 3-year-old. Are they right? AITA?

"Throwaway for obvious reasons, I'm on mobile so ignore mistakes please. 

I (20F) have been working at a small start up my dad owns since I was 17, there are two separate departments of about 6 people each. My boss (38M who i will call Lary) got hired 6 months ago to manage my department that mostly handles customer service and filing, while my dad (50M) manages the other which handles delivery and all the other hands on work.  

The first few months Lary started working with us, he was pretty okay. He didn't need much training or introduction and was able to do his job pretty well. Cue last month when we got a large project, it was something a bit out of our range of work but Dad said he'd pick up the slack with his team and all we had to do was normal procedure. 

We ended up being swamped with work, I remember most nights my dad and I would stay overnight to make sure things were caught up by the deadline. Now, one of the people on my team, who I'll call Susie, is kind of a doormat. She often lets people push things onto her and does things to please others even when she doesn't have to. 

two weeks ago Susie came to me crying, saying she was working so much her hair was falling out and she couldn't take it anymore. This shocked me as we all should've had an even workload, save for Lary, who managed on top of his load. Susie then confided in me that Lary had been hitting on her constantly since being hired. Every time she'd turn him down, he'd stack all of his work onto her, threatening he'd have her take the fall for our department not meeting deadlines if she disagreed. 

Now this might be there I was TA, 
Instead of going to my dad about this, I went straight Lary. I began berating him, calling him names I can't repeat here. I ended it by calling him a deadweight to the company and a pathetic power-hungry pervert. 

My dad had me take a couple days off as he settled the issue at the company. I thought I did nothing wrong but a couple of my male coworkers said I went too far blowing up at him in front of everyone and my dad said that while he understood my frustration, it wasn't professional for a workplace and I cant act like that again without punishment and now I think I took it too far.

So reddit, AITA?

edit: things I forgot to add
Larry's files and paperwork were all found at Susie's desk with his name on them. he wasn't smart enough to take his name off of the work he gave to Susie. edit edit: there were texts on her work cell phone between Lary and Susie, Lary inviting her out, asking her for ""favors"" and giving backhanded compliments and getting rejected and pushing until he was left on read, just to try again later. [thank you for pointing out I left this out]
he was caught on camera giving his work to Susie, I would say he was clever enough to mix it in with her assignments but he put his work on top of hers so it was clear on the cameras it was his. 
Susie came to me with the laptop full of files with his name and manager locks on them when telling me about Larry's treatment. I didn't just hear it and pop off. jeez.
also Lary was fired for stealing from the workplace, blackmailing an employee, and harassing an employee.",0
"A few years ago I was involved in a very painful and scary accident. Most of me was unscathed but my arms (mainly my forearms) were damaged. I recovered 80-85% of my mobility and all I have left now are some scars. Most are not that bad, but three of them are big and pink, which, because of my slightly darker skin, really stand out. It took me ages to really come to terms with myself. I know it sounds silly but I had to practice looking in the mirror and telling myself that my arms and my body are fine, and how silly it is to worry about this kind of thing.

Fast forward to this year where i get an invitation to be a bridesmaid in my cousin's wedding  (which will take place late next year when my cousin and her fiance predict covid to have 'died down').

The first red flag, which I did not pick up on, was when my cousin video called me to show me the bridesmaid dress I'd be wearing (sleeveless, and completely identical to the other 7 bridesmaids dresses). I got up at one point to grab a pair of shoes to show her, leaving the camera on as i did so. When I returned, she had a strange look on her face, and she said she'd have to call me later and hung up.

A week later, she calls me, tearily, telling me that "" I'm so sorry to do this, but my best friend X ruined her dress and you are the only one  with the same size dress...."" 
I clearly knew where this was going and I told her I didn't mind, etc... after some small talk we finished the call. Again, I didn't think much of it. 

Then, a few days ago, my cousin calls to ask what I ended up deciding to wear. I was a bit confused, as this seems very early to worry about a wedding taking place next March, but I pulled a few options out of my closet to show her.
Her response was 'Um, don't any of them have sleeves?""

""No...they all look very pretty though"" I Answered. 

After a pause,  she sighed heavily and said,  ""look, I don't know how else to say this, but I don't want your arms in my pictures. They're just so ugly! Even if your not a bridesmaid you'll still be in the pictures!!"" And then she burst into tears. I was speechless. I felt angry, hurt, and shocked all at once. She kept sputtering and blubbering about how horrible my arms would look in her high-def photos. I was STILL speechless, angry tears getting ready to pour out. Finally, I found my voice and said, ""I don't care how YOU feel about my arms. I spent months coming to terms with my body and I see no reason to hide it. If that's a deal breaker, I won't be at your wedding."" She gasped and I hung up.

Now I'm getting all sorts of texts from my cousin, her fiance, and several of her friends telling me what a selfish b**** I am. I started to feel badly, but I also don't think I should be forced to feel ugly and ashamed. I wouldn't even be in al the important pictures if im just a regular guest? Idk, reddit. I just don't know. AITA?

Thanks for reading.

"Sorry if this isn't the right sub to post this, I'm just not really sure where else is good.

I've been dating my girlfriend Rachel (fake name) for about five years now. We live together and have a really good relationship. She's witty, beautiful, and like the smartest person I've ever met. She's very imaginative and a great artist. She has some quirks though. They aren't annoying or bad or anything, they're just noticeable sometimes:

1. Her cultural reference point is sometimes really odd. Like ""has never heard of the Simpsons but is a fan of a play from 1830s too obscure to have a wikipedia article"". Sometimes I search for things she talks about and I can't even find them.
2. She's really cagey about her past. She won't say where she went to school. Her family aren't in the picture. She didn't grow up here but never says where outside of more personal descriptions (no ""I grew up in chicago"", just ""I used to play in the fields in back of my house""). She occasionally laments not being able to get certain foods she liked as a kid but won't say what they were, just that there's no way to get them. As far as I know she's just a everyday American.
3. She sometimes references a single friend from before she lived in this state. She has a locket of him, but says it wasn't romantic, just that she misses him a lot and he was her best friend. When I've asked she says there's no way to get into contact with him again. I kind of get the implication something bad happened to him or their relationship and she doesn't want to discuss it. 

I don't think it's bad that she doesn't want to talk about her life before knowing me. She generally doesn't like to talk about herself. I'd rather wait until she's comfortable talking about stuff than press the issue.

**The actual issue**: about a month ago was my friend's birthday, and I and some other friends went out to dinner. A movie came up in conversation, one my girlfriend had talked about before, and I casually went ""Oh, Rachel loves that movie."" It turns out this movie hasn't even come out! After chatting about it I ended up talking about a lot of Rachel's other ""quirks"" with them - mostly how she's seen all sorts of movies I've never heard of, but also how I don't really know where she's from and the locket with the friend. Our one mutual friend present also had a similar experience.

A few days ago, Rachel started giving me the cold shoulder. She finally sat down and talked with me today. Turns out our mutual friend asked her about the movie that she had seen, and now rachel's really upset about how I was gossiping and doesn't want to talk to me until ""her head is clear"". I feel really thrown. I didn't discuss her in a very specific or mean way, and our friend only asked about the movie. Was it an asshole move to discuss this with my friends? Should I apologize, or is her reaction extreme? (I'm probably going to apologize anyways, but the situation is confusing me and I would like outside opinions)",0
"So my sister and her husband are living with me temporarily because of Hurricane Ian. Their home in Fort Myers is in bad shape.  

So I agreed to let them stay with me and my dogs.  I own a nice bungalow and it's just me and my dogs.  It's a little crowded but I can deal.  

I have a couple of little dogs and I like to make them raw food. It's healthy for them and I like knowing what they are eating. 

I use cheap ground meat and I mix in chopped up vegetables, seeds, and organ meat.  Also I mix in their doggy vitamins.  

I make up big batches whenever I find ground meat at a good price.  Then I make patties out of the mix and freeze them. At night I take out a couple of patties and leave them in the fridge to thaw out for the next days food.  

When I was out yesterday my BIL saw the ""hamburgers"" in my fridge and decided to grill them up and eat them.  

When I got home I went to feed my dogs but the food was obviously not there. So I asked my sister if she had fed my dogs while I was out.  

She said that her husband had eaten the burgers in the fridge.  I kind of giggled and said oops I guess I need to thaw more out.  

He heard me and said that they tasted off anyway. I told him the reason they tasted off is because they were dog food.  

He started dry heaving and saying he was going to puke.  He yelled at me for keeping dogfood around people food.  

I yelled back that he is a guest and while he is welcome to anything in the house perhaps it would be best if he asked before he ate my food.  

Him and my sister are angry at me that I didn't label my dog food.

 I am kind of angry that I he complained.  Yes I would be a little grossed out too but it's just funny. He isn't hurt or anything. 

There is nothing that isn't edible by humans in the food I make. I would not eat it myself of course.

Part of the reason he is angry is because he says I took it lightly. All I did was joke that he would have a nice shiny coat.",0
"I (M 35) emigrated from *\[Europe\]* to the US over a decade ago. I don't have many ties to my previous country, as my Mom was an only child, and my one uncle on my Dad's side separately emigrated even earlier. So there's my Dad, with whom I'm no contact. my Mom, who I'm pretty close with, and my sister, who we'll call Julie. Julie and I have never been close. 

Since moving, I have returned home a total of twice. Firstly, about 11 years ago, with my wife and our 2 kids at the time (we now have 3), for my Mom's wedding to my Stepdad, (who we'll call Brian), and then again 4 years ago, by myself, for Julie's wedding. In the other direction, my Mom has generally visited about once a year/every other year. This has been the situation/arrangement because it's not financially viable to do otherwise. My wife and I are both employed, and not struggling, but we don't exactly have the kind of expendable income to make the trip given the current financial climate, certainly not last minute. My Mom and I also video chat about once a week.

&#x200B;

With all that out of the way:

Brian had cancer, and went into remission for a while, but it returned about a year ago, and from what we know is almost definitely terminal. A few days ago, Julie messaged me to tell me that I need to start making arrangements to be able to come home when Brian eventually passes to help out and take care of Mom, as she estimates it will likely be within the year. I responded to tell her that while I am working to try and do exactly that, there is a distinct possibility that it may not be feasible. I let her know that Mom and I have had the conversation before, and that she understands my situation.

This morning, I woke up to a voice message from Julie telling me essentially that that is not good enough. That she ""gets that money is a thing"", but I have to step up and do my duty ""for the family,"" and that it would be unacceptable to ""just be there for the funeral"" Because it was my choice to move, I have to make it work. 

To which I responded that she clearly doesn't understand the realities of making a last-minute transatlantic flight, and working within the confines of the US labor system. \[My company will allow 5 days of bereavement time for an immediate family member, and is better with PTO than others , but even then, it's significantly more restrictive than the laws where she is\].

Here's where I think I'm closest to being the AH: When Julie said that she would respond to that later, I told her not to bother. I know what she would have to say, and it would ultimately be meaningless. So now she's told me that lost all respect for me, and I should forget about ever having had a sister.

I don't want to \*not\* be there for my Mom or Brian. But Julie doesn't seem to fathom that there are limits to what I can physically do here.

"Me (23F) and my bf (22M) went to the library earlier today to study. I'm currently studying for the GRE, so I decided to take a practice test in the library. I figured it would be a good testing environment, and my test is only a week away so it was a perfect opportunity to assess where I'm at. Keep in mind that this practice test was one of the only official, timed, graded versions available, so I took this attempt seriously. My bf was aware of this and decided to study for his own tests since he's already in grad school. Also notable to mention is that we were on the top floor of a college library, which is the quiet floor, and there were a bunch of people studying around us.  

The test went smoothly for the first 1.5 hours, and then it came down to the last math section. I was already mentally drained by the previous sections and was on my final stretch to finish the test. But as I began, I heard my bf laughing and talking loudly in response to a lecture he was watching. I looked up and said “shh” to remind him that I was still taking my test plus the room was super quiet. I can’t focus when I hear people talking around me, so I wanted him to reduce the noise. In response, my bf loudly said, “Shut up, I don’t give a f***.” I showed him my screen and mouthed that I was still taking the practice test, and he repeated what he said, laughed, and went back to work. 

I was immediately rattled and embarrassed because not only did I not expect that response, but as I mentioned before, we were on the quiet floor and there were a lot of people around us who likely heard our exchange. I could feel myself becoming flustered and felt tears forming in my eyes, and I tried to finish the exam as best as I could. Once I submitted my exam, I immediately saw my scores which were worse than what I hoped for, particularly for the last section. I felt very frustrated, and I decided to pack my things to go. My bf noticed this and asked where I was going, and I whispered that what he said was super rude/humiliating and impaired my performance, and I didn’t want to be there any more. He said OK, and I left. 

Now that I’m home, my bf has been texting me asking why I would ditch him. He explained that he didn’t know he was being loud and that I impatiently shushed him like he was a baby, which is what provoked his comment. I explained my situation and what I was feeling at the time, to which he responded that I overreacted and was emotionally all over the place because of the test. He said I should take some time to myself and speak to him again when I regain my composure. But he didn’t apologize or express remorse for what he said, and he even said I’m too old to be crying in public like that. 

I don’t feel like I did anything wrong, maybe I could’ve pulled him aside and explained everything, but ultimately I feel justified in leaving since the space turned negative for me and I didn’t want to be around him after he made me feel like that. AITA? ",0
"I am on mobile, so sorry if the formatting is off. 

Earlier today I (22F) had an appointment scheduled for 12:15 pm with an ENT doctor. The appointment was hard to get and this was the only day and time they had available for a few months. So although I had classes until 11:30 and a lab at 1:30 I figured I would be able to make it there and back in time because the office is only a 5 min drive from the University. 

I arrived at 12 to be sure I could get all the paperwork they make you fill out at your first visit done well before my time slot. I then sat in the waiting room until 12:55, at that point I went up to the reception desk and ask how much longer the wait is because I have somewhere to be at 1:30. The receptionist said I would be next, so I sat back down. 1:15 rolled around and I had still not been called to see the doctor. It had now been an hour since my scheduled appointment. So I again went up to the receptionist desk and asked for an actual estimation on the wait time because I have a lab in 15 mins. She told him the wait would be around 30 more mins, which would make me really late for the lab. I explained that I can’t stay any longer and will just have to set up another appointment. She said that would be fine but I would have to pay the cancellation fee. I told her that I’m not cancelling because of my own fault, but because they are way behind schedule and I have other commitments and can no longer wait for them. She said it was not her fault that I over scheduled my day, and to which I replied it was not my fault they over scheduled the doctors. She then said again if I want to book another appointment I would first have to pay the $75 cancellation fee. I told her that’s ridiculous and I will find another ENT doctor and left. 

Most people I have told agree with how I handled the situation, but my mom really laid into me saying it was my fault for not picking another day for the appointment, even though that would be months away.",0
"We're 21, for the reference.

I have mainly lovely classmates, but this guy (M) is something else, he's a year older (he studied abroad for a year and had to repeat the classes as our school is very strict) and you cannont imagine the level of annoyance. I'd describe him like a weird mix between a xenopfobic boomer and your constantly nagging 13 y.o. brother.

We were assigned a final project for our literature class and I was in the same group as him. Fun. It had to be my lucky day, because my period arrived.

Anyway, we were having a skype ""meeting"" and I wasn't well. At all. At one point M started making fun of me for looking pale and I just told him I had my period, so if he was so kind as to shut up I'd be grateful. 

Instead he continued making those clichè jests (sexist, too) about how it meant I was going to be hysterical and have a lots of pimples while crying at romcoms. 

I was so fucking agry! So I started to explain him ""the real"" struggle. How some women have fevers, how there are horrible cramps, sensitive breasts, blood, being tired, weirds poop-routines as ovaries do some creepy magic, sensitivity to smells/perfumes, feeling dirty, HOW EXPENSIVE ALL THE SHIT IS etc. Then I told him all about exhausting men who think women just fake all those struggles so they what, have their daily dose of drama? 

Long story short, it was a TED talk. Afterwards he was too shocked to say anything, and some of my girl-friends started to list their own problems. So I presume he really got the picture. (More like a whole gallery of pictures.)

We finished the project and called it a day.

One of my female friends wrote me how it was all unnecessary and we'd taken it too far, embarrassing him. She also told me she didn't want to know about my period. 

Should I have shut it? I mean, I'm from a family where is not a taboo, so I could cross the line. However, who tf pokes fun on someone because they are pale?",0
"I \[17M\] am of mixed race. My mom \[35F\] is white and my dad \[36M\] is a black Mexican.

My grandfather \[63M\] never liked my dad and back when my parents were just dating he would tell my mom stuff like ""I'm not racist but you have to ask what does a guy like him want with a girl like you?""  ""he wants to marry you for a green card"" etc. When mom got pregnant, grandpa stopped talking to her and demanded she leave his house.

She decided to move in with my dad, get married and whatnot. My parents have always worked hard to give me a good life, and always encouraged me academically. They always helped with my homework, were really active in my schools, my mom even started attending mass at my dad's church so I would have a higher chance of getting a scholarship at a private catholic school \[I did end up going there\].

Despite never needing my grandpa, my parents did attempt to build a connection between me and him. They'd invite him to my bdays and to Christmas but he never came (my grandma would always come).

COVID changed things. My grandma died and I guess the isolation made grandpa rethink his life choices because he slowly attempted to reconnect with us. He never addressed being racist but has apologized for ""prematurely judging"" my dad. Even though he has gotten closer to us, we are not a tight-knit grandpa-grandson duo. I was already 14 when he decided to reach out, so I think it would be naive to think we would be like Little Red Riding Hood and her grandma at that point.

Ok, so here comes the actual ""AITA?"" part because I am aware that up until this point grandpa is the AH.

Last year, I took the SAT for the first time and I got a 1450. My counselor told me that this score combined with my grades and my class rank (#1) meant that I was pretty much safe to apply almost anywhere; however, if it was something that interested me I could try retaking the SAT because if I got a 1500+ we could be talking Ivy League chances then. When I shared this with my family, my grandpa promptly offered to pay for a SAT prep course. I took the course, got a higher score, applied to schools, and eventually got a full-ride to an Ivy school where I'll start in the fall (not sharing where, I want a bit of privacy lol).

Yesterday, my grandpa and I went out and met some of his friends and he was telling them about my future college plans and bragged that if it wasn't for him paying for my course I would not be omw to school in the fall. I corrected him and said that while the course helped it was my parent's hard work that got me where I am, as they were the ones who steered me towards academia anyways.He got mad at me and he now says I'm ungrateful. But I don't think it's fair of him to take credit, when it wasn't him who was there for me throughout my school journey. He was only there for the very end. But I recognize that while I would have gotten into college regardless, perhaps it would not be a full ride at a super elite school, so he \*did\* help. AITA?",0
"This has been bugging me for a few days.  

Went to dinner with my wife recently to a relatively nice place ($30-$45 pp mains). Quick side note, we're both in our 30s and both work in hospitality and worked in kitchens for years, so we're generally on our best behavior at restaurants.  

Anyway. We sit down and are greeted by a young woman (early 20's) who drops some menus and asks if we want to start with still or sparkling water. I looked at the drink menu and saw the still was $9 and the sparkling was $12. Neither of us care that much about fancy water, so I said tap is fine. She gave a sort of grimace and a small noise.  

I asked ""Is there something wrong with the tap water?"" She replied ""It's very hydrating."" Followed by an awkward silence. This was very strange to me so I essentially repeated the question with slightly different verbiage and once again got ""It's very hydrating."" I looked at her with with an expression of ""please explain."" More silence. Eventually I asked ""What does that mean?"" She said, with no emotion: ""It will hydrate you.""  

Now I'm feeling weird about the whole situation. And I flat out asked, with no expression or connotation: ""What's wrong with the tap water?""   

You guessed it! ""It's very hydrating."" I stood up and told my wife ""We're going."" Before my wife even realized what was going on, the waitress said ""Have a blessed day"" with the smuggest smile I've ever seen. Am I in La-La-Land here? The triplicated response seems really dumb for someone who is a 'professional' at hospitality.


Anyway- my wife suggested I took it too far by leaving. In my opinion, I didn't take it far enough and should have spoke to a manager. But life's short- and I didn't. AITA?

UPDATE 1: My wife was cool with leaving. We have a very equitable relationship. If one of us says to the other ""we're leaving,"" or any variation of that, we trust each other to know we made the right call and will figure out the rest later.

UPDATE 2: This is in America. I'm from near there and have had the tap water in the vicinity several times, without issue.

UPDATE 3: Types of water. In my area, it's pretty normal to have 3 choices of water at a restaurant. 1: Still. This is fancy water in a 1L glass bottle, with no bubbles. This was the $9 option. 2: Sparkling water in a 1L glass bottle was $12. 3: Tap water - free. This option was not presented to me, but is a choice if the diner asks.",0
"My (33F) sister, Marnie (35F), has a 3 year old daughter, Annabelle. I love my niece very, very much but Marnie sets down no boundaries for her. Everything Annabelle does is age appropriate but as a parent, it’s your job to help your child become the best person they can be.

When Annabelle doesn’t want to do something or needs to get her way, she screams. It’s very, very loud and hard to ignore. Marnie and her husband instantly give in. As a mom of 4, I completely understand it’s hard to hear your child cry or be upset. And sometimes, yes, absolutely pick your battles. But others, the toddler can’t win.

Around the holidays, Marnie and I hung out a lot with the kids. At one point, we were headed to an aquarium. Marnie started going one way and Annabelle started screaming. Marnie turns around and heads in a direction that’ll add 15 minutes to our route.  When I asked why, she said that Annabelle likes passing a certain landmark on her way. However, Annabelle then started screaming she *didn’t* want to see it and halfway there, we turned around. It added more time and my kids were annoyed.

I let most of this go as Annabelle is not my child, it isn’t my vehicle or house where these predicaments take place. 

But then Marnie broke her leg while her husband was out of town. She needed help getting around and tending to Annabelle. I agreed they should stay with us. 

Last night, we pick up our kids from school, stopping at Annabelle’s preschool last. Once we finally get her in the car (she didn’t want to leave and Marnie let her just run around for 10 minutes, wouldn’t let me grab her because “she’s the boss of her body”) I’m exhausted. I still have to get home and cook. 

As I’m heading in one direction, Annabelle starts screaming for me to go in the other. I calmly explain that way is longer and we don’t have the time. Marnie asks me to just make it easier, she doesn’t want to hear her scream. Going that way will add more time to our drive. I say no again and keep driving, putting on some kid friendly music. My kids are trying to distract Annabelle. 

Marnie starts crying, saying things like “It’s okay, baby! We’ll be home soon! Oh, I know you’re so sad! This isn’t very nice”. The thing is, Annabelle stopped screaming (keep in mind, she never shed a tear, just screamed) after 5 minutes when she realized she wasn’t getting her way.

Marnie later told me that I was horrible for forcing her to listen to her daughter scream. Would it have been so hard to not add stress to her?

My husband agrees that I did the right thing but also pointed out Marnie and Annabella are going through a stressful time. AITA?",0
"I (F32) am currently eight months pregnant with my first, which my husband (M33) and I are absolutely thrilled about. I am nearing my maternity leave (not in the US, for reference), and I was in the office this week to try and finalise all the little loose ends before I am off.

I am primarily a remote worker, so while the team has grown quite rapidly over the past few months, and I have not had an opportunity to meet every new starter in person. That means there were a lot of new faces in this week, and I enjoyed chatting to them.

Now, it is quite obvious that I am pregnant, and my maternity leave has been spoken about quite a bit within the team as I am handing over all of my projects, so new starters have spoken to me about the pregnancy while I was in the office. This is no issue, happy to chat about the baby and our preparations, but I was made quite uncomfortable by one interaction this week.

""Susan"" (F40s) started three weeks ago, and I am handing some of my work over to her while I am gone. I have met her a few times over Teams, but she saw me in person for the first time on Tuesday. She was asking lots of questions about the pregnancy, and detailed (quite graphically) her birth story. It was a bit odd, but I tried to move the discussion on. That is when she said, and I will quote her:

""I am not speaking as your colleague, I am talking as your friend. If you ever feel or notice something odd, please feel free to reach out. This could be cramping, or bleeding, or your water breaking. Even if you need someone to help coach you as you prepare for birth."" 

To be clear, we are engineers and Susan has no medical background. I was so freaked out, why would she offer this kind of help, and why would I call essentially a total stranger and discuss personal details about my body?! We have been totally professional up until this point, and this was my first time even meeting her in person!

I told Susan that I appreciated the thought, but I had a fantastic team of doctors and a very supportive family, so I was okay. Then Susan said, ""It is sometimes easier to talk to someone who has been through it, so please call me even if it is the middle of the night and you don't want to wake your husband"" I told Susan that I was getting uncomfortable because this was not an appropriate discussion for work, and I would appreciate if we could stick to project-related topics only from now on.

Susan seemed quite upset and has subsequently been avoiding me at the office and taking much longer to get back to emails. I mentioned what was going on to my mom, and she said that I was too harsh when Susan was clearly only looking to bond with me and this was the only way she knew how. My mom said I should have told her that the office wasn't the place but I should not have shut down her offer to help. She said maybe Susan was trying to make a female friend at work and just came off a bit weird. So, was I the AH?",0
"English isn't my first language so I apologize for mistakes.

Some info: Both of my friends are childhood friends while i met Ann during high school seven years ago. Mia has a good relationship with Ann's family and best friend of the sister, meanwhile I barely know them since they seemed to brush aside all the interactions I tried with them; after nearly two years trying, I just gave up. (I think we're on neutral terms though).

My friends, who we'll call Ann and Mia, and I decided to do a friend outing to celebrate my birthday next week and we're still deciding the place. We were thinking between a zoo, an aquarium and an amusement park.

The thing is that they've decided to go to the zoo without consulting me for the final decision, and both were extremely insistent with it, so I just agreed.
I thought it was a bit weird because out of those places, the three of us were more inclined to the amusement park (mostly me because I've never been to one and i was very excited to share my first experience with them both).

Yesterday, Ann confirmed to Mia that all four of them would be able to go to the zoo in our group chat, thinking it was the private one with Mia. I asked her what she meant and that I never invited them since I'm not close enough with them to invite them at something as personal as a birthday (Maybe it's ridiculous or childish, but birthdays are quite personal to me and I only want to share them with people who matter to me, like my best friends and family).

Later, Mia explained that she told Ann to invite them (even though she also has all their phone numbers) because she missed them and wanted to see them, and since they wanted to go to the zoo then it'd be two birds with one stone; then said that her mom would probably come too to spend time with her and probably would bring her brother. At that point, I was wondering if they actually wanted to come to spend time between us three, because who invites people the birthday person doesn't even know nor know that well without their permission AND decide the location having those people in mind instead when they shouldn't even be there?

Mia and Ann also decided to bring presents for everyone, which I find kind of a weird thing to do in someone's birthday party, but I decided to ignore it. Since they've been doing so many plans between them without consulting me, I've been thinking of not going because I don't feel as excited for it as before.

I've been letting them know about this subtly because I don't want to hurt their feelings, but it seems that they don't understand what I mean. At some point I even got told that I'm exaggerating and overreacting by Mia, so I'm starting to assume that they do understand, they just don't care.

"My girlfriend has come to me in an aggressive fashion telling me I dont take pride in my clothes because I wear the same type of clothes to most daily activities. She says I wear my “pyjamas” out to the park or supermarkets and my “nice” clothes to the gym or to sleep. 

Some more context to this is that yes I have on some occasions fallen asleep with a nice-ish t-shirt in the past but rarely and usually if we have been out somewhere and I was tired after. I dont believe it suddenly makes that shirt my “pyjamas”. And same thing with the gym, after a day our for breakfast and a walk in the park I decided to duck out to the gym in what I consider a nice-ish tshirt because it was a hot day and I was already sweaty so didnt want to change and go through 2 sets of clothes just to gym, although ill admit it did feel a bit weird to have a brand shirt at the gym…

Now because of these cherry picked incidents she is stretching the truth to make an exaggerated point that I dont have separate outfits for different things and yes this is somewhat true but not to an extreme.

I feel like she is the only one “affected” by this issue because she ‘knows’ i have fallen asleep in a nice shirt so when I wear it out she considers it my pyjamas. No one else would look at me and think im dressing inappropriately but because she knows whats been worn and when she can judge me harder.

I see her point, but at the very worst I think all this does is probably wear out my nicer clothes slightly faster than usual and nothing else, because I still dress nicely when the occasion calls for it, what I do fail to do is the opposite and dress down for bed or the gym sometimes… 

As far as im concerned a lot of the “nice” clothes to me are mostly every day clothes and im happy to interchange gym wear with everyday wear because fitness wear has kind of made in a way where you can wear it outdoors without looking weird. 

What she does is have probably 10 categories of clothes for each different aspect of life. E.g. sleep wear, home wear, outdoor wear, gym wear, park wear, day event wear, night event wear, fancy wear etc. where as some of these categories overlap for me…",0
"Hello, good afternoon. What you are about to read, is a recent cause of emotional distress for me, regret, and I'm doing this post with the help of my colleague and his son, whom insist I'm doing the right thing.

I'm 63 years old. I took advantage of better times, financially speaking, and managed to get enough money to save, have a good retirement, and leave a good inheritance for my children. However, their actions in recent years has broken my heart.

My oldest daughter is a lawyer, married to an attorney. I have another son who is also a lawyer, a third who became an engineer, and the youngest, who is a salesman.

I have been a smoker for many years, and, the predictable outcome has finally caught me, so I may not have many years left. After knowing this, my children began stabbing each other's backs, trying to get their inheritance earlier. Initially were frequent verbal discussions, that escalated to legal battles. The boiling point came when my daughter forged her brothers' signature to take their part of the inheritance while I was being treated at the hospital. Now, none of the siblings can see each other in the eye, and only talk through lawyers.

Saddened by this situation, decided to spend the money, thinking that if all of it is gone, they would have no more reasons to fight. I donated to charities, bought my wife beauty items, went on vacations with her paying for the better looking hotel rooms (no planes because of covid travel restrictions), gave my grandkids expensive gifts, bought my dearests friends and colleagues better equipments to improve their work. We bought a huge TV, prepaid for my funeral, tasted some fine whiskey, among other things.

Right now, about 65-70 percent of my saving are now gone. I plan to keep enough for the time I have left, and leave my wife a good cash amount.

However, my children are noticing that I'm spending a lot, and started to ask questions. My daughter figured out what happened on her own. I had no rebuttals, since I'm guilty of all the accusations she made, but then she mentioned that her children will suffer because of my selfish acts, not only that, but I am cursing all of her grandchildren by doing this.

That made me think, that my grandchildren shouldn't be punished for their parents' sins, and maybe, I was too self-absorbed to realize it sooner. That's my dilemma now.

Edit: Hi, I'm OP's friend's son. I'm writing here because I want to clarify something.

Where we are from, whatever savings the person has, goes directly into their children and living spouse, this is how the law is written. You can write a will on top of that, but biological or legally adopted children can not be entirely written out. Unless (from my understanding) one of the beneficiaries writes themself out of the inheritance. What OP's daughter did was forging a signature in some papers saying the rest of the brothers renounced their inheritance, and they are suing, at the same time as they try to lock in some of OP's properties for themselves while he is still alive, basically trying to do that before another sibling does it before them. 

My relationship with OP is that my dad and him are lifelong friends and colleagues, so OP is kinda like my uncle, as well as my private linguistics teacher. OP has been reading a lot of your comments, and will wake up tomorrow to read even more comments. I suggested OP to post here, and helped to set up the account, and he wrote the post by himself. Thank you all. ",0
"Okay before I say anything; if I sound dumb it’s because I’m naive and a people’s pleaser which I clearly need to change but whenever I do try to set boundaries with people they say I’m being unreasonable so idk how to express what I feel properly and even question my actions. 

Well to give context to the title;
One my closest friends came to crash tipsy at 11pm last month, I allowed it cause she couldn’t go home but i didn’t find it okay cause it’s my parents house and they’re muslim + a bad history with alcoholism in our family. I didn’t tell my mom and allowed her to sober up until she could drive home. Also she drove here tipsy which is fucked up. Mostly, she was on her phone not even talking to me that much, texting and picking up phone calls and one lasted like 30 mins. She also gave me shitty negative guy advice when I never asked for any especially considering the guy she’s seeing went back together with his ex and is cheating on her with my friend but anyways. 

This week she texted me saying she wants to ask a question. After I asked what she took ages to respond eventually asking if she can stay over at my place on Thursday. I told her I have plans and that we can have a sleepover in the weekend cause I was like wdym ‘stay over’? So she then said “oh I’ll be there after 23:00pm so don’t worry”. So I asked her why after 23:00? And her tone changed. She responded with “because I have a party at work and it’s in [name of my city]. But it’s ok I’ll get a hotel or something” I found that pretty weird cause like first you’re coming to my house again tipsy after a party which is already rude to me and now you’re doing it again? And you have the nerve to guilt trip me after I asked you why after 23:00 saying you’ll get a hotel basically saying “if you just stopped being greedy and allowed me to stay then I wouldn’t have to pay money for a hotel”. The shitty part is when I said she could stay over anytime was when I meant that she could stay over when she was having trouble at home with her family. But now it feels like she’s using me for my house which is in the city center and pulling up tipsy after parties not respecting me or my parents wishes. Tbh she is a really good friend and stood by my side during difficult times so I was wondering if I am overreacting and being an asshole? Or if what she’s doing is wrong and that she is indeed guilt tripping me and using my kindness for her own advantage? Please try to be nice, I feel quite hurt about this because I saw her as a dear friend I was very close to. Thank you n have a nice day",0
"For some context, my friend told me how she had an argument with her parents the previous night. She told me that in the morning and then later in maths she sent me a note saying how she didn't want to go home. I replied as soon as I got the note because she seemed super upset about it and I wanted her to know I'm there for her so I replied saying ""Wanna go shopping after school to get your mind off things?"". My maths teacher caught her reading the note and walked up to us and snatched the note and read it. To clarify all that was written in the note was ""I don't want to go home"" and ""Wanna go shopping to get your mind off things?"". My maths teacher asked if I wrote it and I admitted I replied to it. As soon as I said that she shouted at me and threw me out of the class and sent me to the maths office without even hearing me out. I started crying and panicking because I haven't fallen in trouble ever before and especially not kicked out of the class. Most of the teachers found out why she sent that note in the first place and I still felt like it was unfair being kicked out especially because I was showing my friend I cared for her. I was the only one who got in trouble for it especially when my Maths teacher didn't even know the context in the first place. I never got justice for being embarrassed and insulted in front of my peers and rumours spread about me in school of me being mischievous as well. AITA?",0
"Background: I get more vacation time than my wife. I use this time to do volunteer projects abroad. We still do a major vacation (overseas) together every 2 or so years and mini-vacations (Disneyland, Vegas, etc) yearly. I'd take more with her but she's self-employed and can't make it work. Our together vacations are generally more what she wants to do, say 60/40. I'm happy to travel anywhere. 

She's also very indecisive. Our last trip was Ireland. We had talked about it for ages. One afternoon, I was looking at flights, asked her if a certain date worked and then just immediately booked it (she's Irish and always wanted to go. I had been there before, so it wasn't the top of my list to go back). I generally make the first big purchase and then she plans after that. I get my dopamine by booking flights, she gets hers from planning. We are generally happy with this arrangement.

Current situation:

She's been talking about going overseas to this one location for a few years. A volunteer project came up in that local for Feb 2025. I signed up for it. It's only 2 weeks and I suggested she could join me before or after to vacation together. I figured she had a year to sort out her end of it with work/money. She sets her own schedule and Feb is usually slow, which is why I picked it.

She was a bit upset because I was ""stealing her vacation"". I thought this was good compromise.

This was a specific project I had on my bucket list. Sea life conservation. I could have went to a different country but it would have doubled the price. I thought I was doing a good thing but now I'm a jerk. Thoughts?",0
"Classic ""I know this sounds bad, but..."" and throwaway because she knows my main.

I (29m) have been dating my girlfriend (27f) for a year and a few months.  She moved in with me just about three weeks ago.  Honestly, since she's moved in I've been feeling a bit smothered. She's currently unemployed due to Covid and doesn't seem to be very aggressively looking for work and I feel like she sort of expects my attention all the time, and I feel like she's been scrutinizing me too much.

I'm an essential worker and recently was moved to overnights. Yesterday morning when I got home from work at a little after 7am she wasn't awake yet. I was a little too wound up from work to go straight to bed so I decided to pour myself a bourbon and sat down to find something mindless to watch on YouTube.  

My girlfriend got up maybe 15 or 20 minutes later and came into the living room where I was sitting. As I greeted her I saw her eyes narrow as she looked at the glass in front of me. ""Wait a minute,"" she said. ""You're actually *drinking*?""

""Yeah, so?"" I answered.

""It's morning. Who drinks first thing in the morning?"" 

I tried to explain to her that it wasn't ""first thing in the morning"" to me, that this was my evening time, and that just because I worked overnights didn't mean that I shouldn't be able to unwind after work with a drink like anyone else. But she just couldn't seem to get past that it was ""morning.""

Finally I'd had enough and told her that she needs to stop smothering me, that I'm a grown man and unless I'm doing something egregious that I shouldn't have to justify myself to her and that I don't need to her permission to have a drink. I told her that I was trying to relax and that if she was just going to give me a hard time to please just leave me alone.

She's been pretty quiet with me since. I know I hurt her feelings which I feel bad about, but I also think she was being unreasonable and somewhat controlling and that I wasn't wrong to tell her to knock it off. AITA?

Edit: Wow, this blew up. Thanks everyone. I have to say; I went all the way to the bottom just out of curiosity over the unpopular opinions and a couple in particular didn't deserve the downvotes. One especially suggested that this may have been mere ""growing pains"" for a couple newly learning to live together. Although I absolutely still think my gf was being way too close-minded and somewhat controlling I think that poster may have a point. My profession is a currently unpopular one and has a pretty abysmal divorce rate and while my girlfriend was being unfair I realize I also took my night out on her to an extent and probably should have been more patient. Hopefully she can see my side, too.

To my ""aggressively seeking employment"" comment most of of my state has reopened and while it's still a really tough job-market it's not abysmal by any extent.

Also to the absolute most dowvoted comment; his/her username is a Skyrim reference so he/she is automatically awesome.",0
"Alright so I (28F) have hEDS, which for those who don’t know is a connective tissue disorder. One of the many symptoms is frequent injuries, especially dislocations and subluxations. I wear ankle braces whenever I plan to be on my feet for any period of time. I also dislocated my kneecap playing with a puppy on Saturday. 

I was at the “pharmacy” and after placing my order, sat down in the only available chair with my leg extended for my knee to get some relief. An “older” woman (40s or 50s) comes up to me and says that I am young and should let the older people there have the chair. I responded by pointing at my fully visible ankle brace since my knee brace was hidden by my pants and said something along the lines “Are you an idiot that thinks I wear these as a fashion statement?”. She called me a bitch and sulked away. The other people there gave me weird looks. Was I too harsh?

ETA: Was not expecting so many replies! I just want to clear a few things up since I can’t answer everyone’s comments. I don’t think 45 is old! I was quoting her saying “older”. It was one of the reasons I reacted strongly. This isn’t the first time I’ve had an experience like this as well so I kinda snapped. I also understand that she could’ve had an invisible disability but the only reason she gave for her demands (not a polite request) was that she was older than me. There was another occupied chair that had a man about her age in it and she didn’t ask or demand he get up. I would’ve absolutely given her the chair no problem if she gave me a reason better than mine to sit. I don’t think being in your forties or fifties by itself is a better reason to need a chair than having bad ankles and a recently dislocated kneecap. 

Anyway, thank you to everyone who replied. I think I am just gonna come up with a snarky response to situations like this that doesn’t result to name calling. Have a nice day :)

ETA2: guess who is getting death threats for saying they have a “fake disorder” lmao. Yes, I am totally faking for clout on tiktok /s I don’t even have a tiktok. I dislocated my shoulder picking up my water bottle but sure there’s nothing wrong with my connective tissue. Also, it’s not like I begged a doctor until I got a diagnosis (not that doing that isn’t sometimes necessary). I was referred to a rheumatologist by my dermatologist because I have psoriasis (do you think psoriasis is also fake?) and she wanted to have me checked for psoriatic arthritis. Ended up with and hEDS diagnosis. I had only vaguely heard of EDS before and didn’t think I had it because the person talking about it had vEDS which tends to be much more severe.",0
"I, 17F have a relatively large group of friends, and we've been friends for around 6 years.

Last year on my 17th birthday, my mom bought 4 tickets for a first class steam locomotive and riverboat ride (I'm a huge train enthusiast).

The tickets were not cheap, around $150-$200 each, and we got seats right behind the engine itself. This was really special for me and I had one spare ticket for any one of my friends to go. But instead of celebrating with ME on MY birthday (after also missing my 16th birthday, might I add) they decided to have a pool party. 

They knew the party was on my birthday and they used the excuse of wanting to do a party before summer ended (this was in June by the way, the very beginning of summer vacation for us), so I ended up going on this ride alone, having to sit next to an empty seat the entire time while my friends sent selfie's of how much fun they were having in the group chat.

What hurts even more is that their party maybe lasted for 2 hours before they left because it was ""too cold"" outside - while I spent the entire night out celebrating with my parents.

Fast forward to now, EM -the girl who arranged the pool party at her house- is having a birthday party in Febuary. And my friends are asking if I want to come. And truth be told? I don't. The only person I got an apology from was my friend Z because she was forced to go to the pool party.

I know they're gonna ask why I can't go, and I'm afraid if I tell them... it's just going to cause drama and make everyone feel like shit. But I just can't ignore the fact that I had to sit alone, especially when it was on a live steam engine, which meant so much to me because I want to grow up to drive steam engines myself.

So... WIBTA for skipping the birthday party?",0
"Short and sweet-

We went to the beach and everyone I came with was wearing shorts and t-shirt, I had my bikini under mine so I don't think they knew before hand that I would bring one nor did I know they wouldn't. We got out and I undressed on the beach excited to swim. Everyone gave me side eyes but carried on to the water. I stayed behind to unpack the stuff with SO's mother and SIL. SIL looks me up and down and says "" Is that what you're wearing?"" and I said ""Yeah, I wanted to swim too"" laughing. She gives me a weird look and says ""Around kids?"" I was hella confused so I just said ""Yeah, is that weird?"" She responds ""Well I wouldn't wear that, I don't dress like that around kids"" I said ""Oh sorry""  we look at each other for a sec before she says ""Well, what are you gonna do about it?"" SO's mum was about as confused as I was at this point. I said ""Swim?"" and she asks me to put my clothes back on before going around her children and to never dress like that around her kids. I didn't really want to swim at this point so I said ""I don't really have a change of clothes but I guess I can stay on the beach"" So I watched everyone swim while I was ruminating on what just happened. Still confused, hella confused. I thought wearing a bikini at the beach was normal?

AITA?


EDIT FAM: So to keep it easier to read and all that I'm just gonna give a quick Q&A instead of a story type thing yk?

Q: What bikini were you wearing?
A: Just a normal two piece. No butt showing and not too much cleavage.

Q: Where was SO?
A: He was swimming when it happened and after about 10mins of me sitting on the beach he came over and asked why I wasn't swimming. I told him I didn't feel too comfortable swimming anymore and I'll tell him why later. He told me to stop being ridiculous and I said something about not ruining the day so we talked later at home, he comforted me and told me that if SIL says anything of that kind again to get him straight away to deal with it.

Q: What was everyone else wearing?
A: Everyone else was either in t-shirt or shorts, some men were in just shorts. We were on a public beach but away from any of the other swimmers, so it was just us then.

Q: Why didn't MIL say anything?
A: Well tbh we both don't get along with the SIL and so we both kinda just learned to stay out of her way since when she's challenged she spins stories to her husband and he believes her and immediately defends her, sometimes a little too strongly. Also we were both stunned by her response which will probably explain as well why we both didn't say much.

To clarify, there were 14 of us at the beach, 7 kids 7 adults. No one in a bikini but me. SO's family were religious when he was young but haven't gone to church for years except of course his SIL who still attends. Only she had a problem. I live in Aussie where it's fairly normal as well to wear a bikini.",0
"My fiancé (M, 51) committed to going on a spring break vacation trip to some of our bucket-list hiking destinations with his brother, his brother’s wife, and their son without including me (F, 39) or my two children. I was obviously very upset when I found out. He told me he had committed to going when we were not really getting along. 
Regardless, several weeks had passed between the time he committed to going and when he finally told me. He said he wanted me to go (my kids would be with their dad during that time), that he had bought refundable tickets and he could cancel if anything and we could plan a trip together with my kids at a later time.  I was still upset but relented and said I would see if I could make it work. Unfortunately, the next day I realized I could not make the pre-determined dates work with my schedule. I told him this assuming he would cancel as he had already suggested. He then proceeds to tell me that he is still thinking of going because he doesn’t want to disappoint his nephew and he will resent me if he has to cancel. 

I can’t help but feel extremely disappointed by this and the fact that he would make these plans in the first place without including or considering me and my children, and that he would even want to do these things without me. I had always thought we would experience these places together. 

I feel he is now using his nephew as an excuse and a way to somehow make it seem as if I’m unreasonable for being upset over this. I can’t help but feel like I’m being manipulated. Am I wrong for feeling so hurt and disappointed over this?   ",0
"My sister gave birth to her twins boy and girl in June of 2020. She had been living with me before then after being evicted. I have three kids and work full time and I told her if she was going to keep her babies she was going to have to find other living spaces. I have a 2 bedroom and it’s cramped already. I’m not sacrificing my room to share with her and 2 newborns. She said okay.

When she was six months pregnant she said she was going to give her baby up for adoption and contacted this top adoption agency. They sent her a pamphlet of potential parents. I was shocked since she never brought up giving them up for adoptions. I felt guilty and told her if she got a job and paid me 400$ a month maybe we could find a 3 bedroom. She said she doesn’t want to be a mom and she’s made up her mind.

She ended up choosing a very wealthy couple for her baby. They both made six figures and had a very clean squeaky look to them. I told her they looked stuck up and she said that she wanted her twins to live an upperclass lifestyle. The agency and couple flew her out to their city in a 5 star hotel for the rest of her pregnancy.

It was supposed to be an open adoption and when my sister came back they did send pictures once a month by mail. When the twins were about six months all of a sudden they ghosted my sister, deleted all their social media handles to probably create new ones, and even moved. My sister had a breakdown and I was equally shocked. The agency brushed her off and said the parents have the right to do whatever they want and told her not to call again unless she was pregnant. For weeks I pitied my sister until she got drunk and told me something. She said that she texted the adoptive mom that she needed 2k because she wants to go back to school or something and the mom told her she doesn’t feel comfortable with my sister messaging her asking for money and my sister told her that they’re beyond rich and 2k is what they spend in a day so they’re not hurting and that’s when they ghoste d her. That changed things for me and I told my sister that she shouldn’t have done that and that maybe they had a point. She started crying and is still giving me the cold shoulder. Aita?",0
"I work in the city. My commute is about 1.5 hours each way. My wife loves the place where we live and is a stay at home mom with our six year old son. 

Some days her and our son come into the city with me. They will spend the day running errands or seeing the city. Sometimes she leaves him with her folks and comes in alone with me so she can spend a day alone or with friends. 

I work four ten hour days. That way I work forty hours and still get three days off. When I'm working I don't have time to run errands. So on the days she comes in I ask her to take care of some stuff. 

The problem is she often forgets to do what I need. She will say it just slipped her mind or she got too busy or something. So then I have to drive into town to take care of some stuff. The closest town is only a half hour so it's not terrible. But there is also a limited selection for the stuff I need or the places that provide the services I require. And they are expensive. If I must I will drive into the city, wasting my money, time, fuel, and putting miles on my car. 

So for the last year I have been asking her to text me everything she has on her list to get done for me. And then again around 4:30 so I know it has all been completed. 

She has been good about it but she complains that I am treating her like a child and that she will remember to do everything she promised to do.  I agreed that she could go back to her way last week and she got carried away talking with her friends and didn't notice it was almost time to pick me up until I called her to let her know I would be at a different office. She showed up to pick me up and none of the stuff she was supposed to do got done. 

I asked if we could please go back to the texts because she obviously needs them. She said yes but she is upset with me for not trusting her. 

I do trust her. Just not to remember to do what I need.",0
"I (21,f) have a aunt (30,f) who, a while ago, opened a restaurant a few months ago.

Once or twice a week I get lunch at a small restaurant in my work break. There is a nice, cheap one close to my work place. Always enjoyed it there.

Now my aunt figured out I go there to eat instead of her restaurant.

I have been to her restaurant before on different occasions and it's a nice place but 
- it's further away from work (but doable)
- it's not super expensive but still less cheap than the other one
- food is great in both
- aunts one has less options on the menu I can/want to eat (vegetarian and allergies)
- wait times are often longer in aunt's restaurant
- aunts one has the nicer interior design and looks but i don't really care about that

So I prefer this other one for my lunch breaks. 

My aunt found out I would have the option to go to her restaurant for lunch but choose not to and instead support the competition. She was very mad and my mom sided with her, saying I should support family and therefore my aunt's business.

Aunt and I had a good but not close relationship. Just relatives seeing each other a few times a year and chatting at family dinners
She does not offer me any family discount or anything. I know she doesn't have to but at the same time I feel like I should be able to freely choose where to eat

So tell me reddit ... AITA?",0
"I 20F started online side hustles 1 year ago and I have made a pretty good income since. My sister always wanted to have a horse and I also loved horses. I bought one for myself about 6 months ago. I called her Reina and I have to admit I don't always go horse riding. I told my sister 22F she could ride whenever she wanted and she started taking lessons on her. My sister loved Reina. At one point she tried changing her name but I did not allow it. After a while she started calling her ""My horse"" and she would frequently invite friends to ride her. I would hear it from the stable owner. I didn't think much of it until recently.

My sister came to me and said she wanted to move Reina to another stable. I asked her why and she said she wanted Reina in the same stable as her friends horse. I didn't like the idea but after all she is frequently riding on Reina and the other stable is also closer to home so I said sure. Then she said she had already arranged everything because she knew I'd say yes. I got annoyed but just let it slide. So last week I went to visit Reina and wanted to ride. Turns out my sister also wanted to do horse riding. I haven't been on Reina for 2 months or so while my sister rides like 3/4 times a week. I told my sister that I only have time that day and said she could rent a horse for that one lesson on my costs.

She then told me that I should just get off of her horse and rent one for myself if I want to ride that bad. We got in an argument and she literally yelled at me for everything. She said that I am a bad sister that I don't care about her that I am a brat and I don't deserve anything. Now our relationship always has been bad and she has always had anger issues but this reaction really pissed me off. I told her that Reina was not her horse in any sense. I pay for all her expenses. I paid for the horse and my name is the name on Reina's passport. I told her that from now on she is not allowed to ride Reina and she can either buy herself a horse or rent one but she needs to stay away from mine. My sister kept yelling and said that I am stealing her horse and that Reina doesn't even know me. She said that I am the worst sister ever and told our parents. My parents think that I am right but that I am overreacting because my sister has always had anger issues. They are saying that my sister really loves horse riding and she loves Reina. I told them she should have thought about that before disrespecting me. So AITA?

&#x200B;

Update: I see a lot of people who actually think I ride her once in 2 months. That is not true. I used to visit her 1-3 times a week but those 2 months I have been very busy. The first month I was with her really really often to create a bond and Reina knows that I am her owner. When she saw me she was really happy and did not go to my sister but she came to me. So she definitely knows who her owner is. Besides get my ass off? I have explained this in so many comments. I have been busy with work and didn't even have enough time to sleep. I love my horse and I always try to visit her but in the last 2 months I did not have any time. My life has been full with work and study. I had to travel a lot for work as well to meet new clients or projects etc. I have been doing schoolwork on airplanes. I have been working my ass off to keep up with this life and I pay thousands of dollars for Reina to be taken care of. Reina is being exercised multiple times a week and is definitely taken care of in the best way possible.",0
"My neighbors(we don't really talk to them) got a litter of four kittens about two years ago, two boys, two girls. And they never got them neutered. 

I know the boys don't stray far from home for long but one of the girls has already disappeared. The fourth one is the cat in question. Four is already on her fifth litter at just over two years old. She's not the size of a normal queen her age, she's smaller. 

We started feeding what looked like a stray, smaller than four, but the same colour, we heard from another neighbor that she is from fours first litter. Honestly though you wouldn't think so cause she's a little feral. 

I over heard the neighbors telling other neighbour that she hasn't been home in weeks, but they didn't sound too fussed, but rather nonchalant. 

It was while I was away roommate started to feed four, though she thought she was feeding feral at the time. Turns out four had her fourth litter weeks earlier and feral was on her third. Both of these cats are underweight and malnourished from all the pregnancy's and having to compete for food with the Tom's. 

We do have cats already which is why we have the food, our cats are well fed and neutered and they've never been food aggressive unless they get over exited for treats and then it's our fingers that get it. But they have been rather chill if a bit growly at first with four and feral. They've not growled at the girls in months, it's the other way around 

As of the time of this post feral had just had her fourth litter(we think she had overlapping pregnancy's with 3&4 both outside) and fours fifth is close to her due date. 

Four has taken to sleeping inside our house for the last couple of weeks and not really leaving unless she needs the toilet. We plan on getting her spayed as soon as its safe for her to. 

I feel like I'm the Asshole because I'd go mental if someone stole my cats, but here I am already planning to get her neutered.

So AITA?

"So basically, my husband (30M) has a colleague in his office, who's also one of his close friends. Let's call him Kurt. They work in the field of IT and I (previously a teacher) want to go into the IT field. So, I enrolled in a paid program/course last November and I'm 70% through the syllabus. Kurt also had enrolled in the program in 2022 and now his course has expired. The program is asking him for an extension fee around 100 dollars. Today my husband asked me if I'd be okay sharing my ID and password of that course with Kurt, so he can finish his course. He promised Kurt won't change any of my answers or responses but just use it to practice the questions on his own. The thing is I'm totally uncomfortable with sharing this and I don't know if I'd be the a-hole if I say no. Also, I and Kurt have met on several occasions and are friendly with each other but I won't call us friends.
WIBTA if I say no to this request?

"
I (26F) didn’t get to attend my high school graduation due to getting injured the day before. When it came time for my college graduation, the pandemic just started and no one got a graduation that year. What I really looked forward to was finally walking across a stage in a cap and gown after I completed my masters. My ceremony was Saturday.
I’ve been dating my boyfriend “Josh” (27M) for close to a year now. Originally, it was planned that he along with my parents would attend the graduation ceremony and we’d go out to eat after.

On Thursday, Josh’s mom unexpectedly passed away. It truly came out of nowhere and devastated everyone. I’ve been helping Josh and his family the best I can to make preparations. The funeral is Monday.
I really grappled with whether or not I should attend my graduation, but ultimately decided I should. It’s one day and I figured Josh would be okay without me for a few hours. I obviously didn’t expect him to come anymore, but offered the invitation. He seemed a little stunned but said ultimately he wasn’t going to be able to go and I respected that. My parents seemed a little surprised that I still planned to go, but we went and got dinner afterwards.

When I got back to Josh’s that night (he’s been staying at his dad’s), his sister, “Amelia” (30F) went off on me. She asked how I could abandon Josh at this time. Apparently, he ended up having a complete breakdown upon finding some momentous of his mother. Josh hadn’t cried since he got the news but it finally hit him that his mom was gone. He was inconsolable for over an hour. Amelia was the only one there to comfort him. I went to check on him and he didn’t want to see me. I tried to explain to Amelia that this was a once in a lifetime event and that I never had a graduation before. She fired back with “Well, Josh has never had a parent die before”. Ultimately, Amelia and Josh’s dad asked me to leave as I was upsetting both of his children.

I’ve tried to contact Josh since and he’s told me he needs some space. I asked if he still wants me to come to the funeral and he said it’s completely up to me. I brought this up with a friend and she was floored that I had still gone to the ceremony. It seems to be the consensus with everyone that I should’ve skipped it.

Was I wrong?",0
"to get straight to the point, my (18F) fathers (49M) request was for me to change my legal name and i said no. my reasoning for not wanting to is quite simple, it's that i don't want the hassle of a new name. 

unfortunately my father doesn't see it this way and he insists that i have to do it otherwise 'i'll end up suffering for 20 years'

we got into a huge argument because he wouldn't stop pushing the issue even though i specifically told him my concrete answer was no. he started telling me i was ungrateful and that he didn't like the way that i talked to him. 

when i still wouldn't budge he kicked me out and told me to pack my bags and leave within two weeks. obviously at the time i was feeling angry but now i can't help but feel bad about it. not only do i not have enough funds to get lodging but i have college fees to worry about too.  

im thinking about it now and it really is a simple request, i feel stupid and like an asshole for being so stubborn about it. he is my dad after all, and he has sacrificed a lot for me since we're an immigrant family. i know my financial situation may be factoring into it but i don't know. i feel like at this point i should just go back and apologize. am i the asshole here?",0
"My parents have two huge dogs that I absolutely adore, they are about 150 pounds each and require a lot of attention. Well, my parents decided to book a three month long vacation to a tropical country that they leave for in 2 days, and they haven’t found anyone to watch the dogs yet. They’ve had MONTHS to find someone to look after them yet they decided to leave it till now. My mom asked me today if my partner and I would take them but we live in a very small apartment and it would be extremely unreasonable to try and keep 2 150 pound dogs there and we already signed on the lease that we wouldn’t have any pets. My parents are acting like it is our (their kids) responsibility to watch the dogs which is extremely frustrating as we’re not the ones that decided to get two dogs then fuck off to another country for three months, but I care about these dogs so much and am very concerned for there well being so I stared wondering if I’m the asshole for not being willing to take them.

"My (M36) wife (F27) and I just purchased our first home.  We have always rented before.  

I'm what my grandfather called a shade tree mechanic.  I work on my car and other people's cars just in my shop when I have time.  It's a side hustle. I'm a teacher in real life.  So is she.  

I, in the past, have gotten grease and dirt on our hand towels and she has told me off.  I don't do it anymore, not for a long time anyway. 

Our new home has 2.5 bathrooms.  Including the one that we have for guests.  She decorated it with all that stuff to make it look nice.  Honestly it's nicer than she decorated our ensuite in our room.

She spent all week getting the house ready for our friends and family. She is very happy to show off our new home. As am I.  

I cleaned up the backyard and the shop so I could show my friends and family where I goof off.  

One of the things she did was to leave a note pinned to the hand towels in the gust bathroom. It said ""if you touch these I will end you"" and she had drawn a little skull and crossbones. 

When it was time for everyone to come she told me to check everything and make sure it looked nice.

I suppose one of the things I should have done is to remove the note.  I did not.  

We had an excellent party and everyone left with a full belly and a smile.  

The day after the party we were cleaning up and I here her call me by my name.  She never calls me by my name. I hadn't done anything bad recently so I wasn't sure why I was in trouble.  

I had not touched the hand towels. And neither had anyone else.  They were immaculate. 

She says I did it on purpose to make her look bad. I totally just missed the note.  She called her mom and I heard her saying it was my fault people think she doesn't want them using her towels.  

It's such a minor thing but she is still mad at me.  

AITA?

Edit. My wife found this. I am officially going to be ended. Oh well I had a good run. 

For all of you saying that I only cleaned up the yard and my garage. Yup you are right.  And since I do not have a riding mower yet it only took me about four hours.  Good thing we aren't in a heat wave or anything.  

My wife wants me to tell you that she did not call her mom to complain about me.  She was venting because she thought everything went perfectly.  And WE made a silly mistake. We already laughed about it.  And we are getting the note framed and it will have pride of place on our guest bathroom.",0
"My wife has a horrible habit that I discovered 2 months ago. We were ordering lunch on the Subway app and I told her to pick the location that has a drive thru that way we don’t have to go inside and take the baby out of the car just to clip him back in a few minutes later.  She told me it’s not a big deal to leave the baby in the car to run in and pick it up really fast.  I had no idea she ever did this.  I told her I was not comfortable with her leaving him in the car alone even for a minute and she told me she’s been doing it since he was born and it’s always been fine.  She told me she does it to pick up food, run into the post office or pharmacy, etc.  I was floored.  We don’t live in a horrible area but it’s also not super safe either.  I told her to not ever do this again.

She told me she never stopped to think about the potential dangers and that she would stop doing it.  Well yesterday as I was driving home from my brother’s house I spotted her car at the gas station near our place.  It was parked in a spot up front and not a pump, so I figured she stopped in to grab some snacks which we like to do.  I decided to stop and go in and say hi and get some food and I pulled in and parked next to her.  However when I got there I was furious to find our son in his car seat.  The car wasn’t even locked.  

I don’t know what came over me, but in that moment I decided to take my son and put him into my car (he’s got a car seat in there too).  I then drove to the other side of the gas station parking lot and waited for my wife to come out.  It took SIX MINUTES for her to appear.  When she saw that he was gone she looked stunned for a second and then started to frantically look around and cry.  I didn’t let it go on long, after this I saw her pull her phone out, presumably to call 911, and that’s when I pulled my car around to her.  I parked, got out and walked around to my sons door, and opened it to show him to her.

She looked extremely relieved but that quickly turned to anger with her asking me why I took him and did that to her.  I told her she needed to learn her lesson and she promised to stop leaving him in the car, and that she was extremely irresponsible.  It was so easy for me to pull up and take him.  No one else at the gas station even noticed!  So if he really was taken there would’ve been no help and it would’ve been 100% her fault.  

She proceeded to call me cruel and psychotic and tried taking our son out of my car into hers.  I said no and that I would be driving him home, and I left.  She came home not much later but ignored me the rest of the day.

She acknowledged me today saying she wanted an apology and I said absolutely not and she’s the one who should be saying sorry.  She’s been guilt tripping me the rest of the day saying no mother should experience the fear I put her through.  Did I go too far?  AITA?

"Me and my GF live with each other and have been together for 6 years. 
I have had my driving license for 9 years and my girlfriend has had her license for about 18 months.

How it works in the UK, is that for each driving offence you commit you get 3 points and if you gain 12 your licence gets suspended. Points expire after 48 months anyways.
For new drivers, if you gain 6 points within your first 2 years your license also gets suspended.
For your first speeding offence you get to take a speed awareness course whixh only takes 2 hours after that, you get 3 points for each offence.

So my GF was on 3 points and driving my car was caught by a speed camera driving at 42 in a 30 zone. 
I initially got sent the letter as the vehicle was registered in my name and had to let them know who was driving. If I said it was me I'd have to take a small speed awareness course which only takes 2 hours and is over zoom but if I told them it was my GF then she'd get another 3 points. Meaning she'd get her license suspended, have to wait 6 months to reapply, retake her driving and theory tests and take a mandatory 10 hours worth of lessons. All this would probs amount to about £500.
I've got no reason to not put my own name other than wanting to keep my driving record spotless (which isn't really a good reason). But I just don't want to have that on my license even though I know it won't affect me as I'm unlikely to reoffend. 
I told my GF I'm telling DVLA it was her who drove and she flipped out on me, saying it makes no difference to me to say I was driving. But with her she would lose her license. I told her it was her own fault, which annoyed her even more because I was being unreasonable.
Her not driving doesn't really affect me, whenver we're both going somewhere I drive anyways, only means she'd have to wake up an hour earlier to get public transport to work.
Everyone I've spoken to about this including my own family members have said I'm being petty and might aswell take a speed awareness course. As it won't affect me at all as I'd have to speed about 5 more times in the next 3 years to lose my license.
So AITA for refusing to take a speed awareness course for no good reason (only reason, is I just don't want to take it, I can't justify why not) and therefore making my GF lose her driving license.",0
"Okay so you'll need some context here fist; I  am a single father to a 5 year old son. His mother isn't involved. She was incredibly manipulative and verbally/emotionally abusive. For a few reasons the courts awarded me full custody of our kid. She was allowed visitation, but basically said ""I get full custody or nothing at all"" and hasn't made any attempt to contact our son for three and a half years. Tbh, I prefer it this way; she's a very toxic person who has repeatedly demonstrated an unwillingness to change and she runs with some people I don't want my son around. If she comes back and demonstrates a willingness to put effort to be better for our son, she can see him but til then, I'm very on board with her staying away. 

I've found being a single parent difficult and at times have needed a lot of help/support. This help has often been provided by my older brother and sister in law. They've done things like taking me to appointments, cared for kiddo while I worked/went back to school, helped with bills/groceries when I was on my arse financially, paid for kiddo to do activities I couldn't afford with his friends to keep him from being left out...they've honestly been an absolute lifeline for me, and I just want to establish off the bat that I am incredibly grateful for all they've done for me. 

During lockdown 3, brother and SiL have been watching kiddo while I work (they're both WFH), and have absolutely refused to let me pay them for it. Well, during this time, my son has been asking more and more questions about his mum, which I've done my best to answer in age appropriate ways. He's also been getting upset about her not being around more and more. It really sprang out of nowhere, so I was confused until a few days ago, when he said Auntie Laura kept telling him things about mummy, and they were different to things I had told him. I asked what kinds of things she'd said and I'll spare you the details for the sake of character count (can clarify in comments), but it was incredibly inappropriate stuff.

I'm so angry about this. My kid is upset, I'm in a very awkward position, my SiL went behind my back...I confronted she and my brother about it and they both got very defensive saying I can't expect her to badmouth her friend and I'm being unreasonable. I said that it's not unreasonable to want to protect my kid, and that they've demonstrated that I can't trust them around him. I've even stopped letting them watch him, and my neighbour is doing it instead. They're really upset with me, my brother called me an ungrateful arsehole and my SiL says she can't believe I'm being like this over one little thing after all they've done. 

Am I overreacting?

Edit: realises I deleted a kind of important point for character count; My ex and SiL were friends at secondary school and college, which is how my ex and I met. They're not as close as they used to be, but they're still casual friends.

Edit 2: people said I should include this from the comments on the post so here it is; 

>My ex made a lot of accusations about me that were provably false during the trial, part of the reason she didn't get custody. This includes accusing me of being a serial cheater (I wasn't and could prove I was in other places at times when she said I was with other people), accusing me of causing an injury she got in a car accident I wasn't even present for and saying that *I* was the one who was emotionally abusive. She told him that the reason his mum and I fell out was because I *felt like* she was very unkind to me and mummy *felt like* I had other girlfriends, hurt her and was the unkind one. She didn't say any of the accusations were true, but she didn't say they weren't either and obviously a 5 year old doesn't have the critical thinking skills to figure it out for himself. Not so much that she lied herself, she just repeated my ex's lies.",0
"I (30F) had a funeral to attend with my older son (12M) of his best friends mom who is also one of my best friends .  My Husband (29M) didn't want to go. I left work an hour sooner got the kids settled and got myself ready so As soon as he got home from work I was walking out the door as previously planned...  I only decided to attend with my oldest Son and leave the other children (5M, 6M, 8F, 10M) home with my husband. We left at 3pm and it lasted until 8:30pm we were included in the food after.  I didn't buy or bring food home I assumed that if I was busy my husband could handle it. However, I walked in to Kids starving and my husband yelling at me I didn't buy him food on the way home. (he didn't even ask. So AITA for not preparing dinner or buying dinner?",0
"My husband and I have family dinners at our house every month or so with our family. I have some sets of fine china that I like to switch out between the seasons that I've inherited from my grandmother. When we have our get togethers I serve dinner on these plates. My MIL compliments them everytime. My Sister-In-Law, however, has made comments to me that ""they're not her style."" I honestly didn't think twice her comment about it until this past february when one of my plates was put in the sink, broken. Chalked it up to an accident.

  
In April we had another dinner. This time SIL was carrying both her and her boyfriends plates to the sink, & accidentally dropped both. Again, no biggie at all. In May she broke two more plates & in June she broke a plate and a cup. At this point I was catching on.  I brought up these concerns to my husband and he brushed it off as accidents. I told my mom and she said she thought my SIL was doing it on purpose & got me a camera to put in my dining room.  
  
In July we had dinner, and I had an opportunity arise. My MIL, SIL and her bf joined us for dinner. While our plates were still ON THE TABLE my MIL asked how my plants were doing and I said I'd show her! I told my husband to follow us outside so he could show her the plant he's growing, leaving SIL alone with her bf. When we came back inside 5 mins later, her plate was broken.  When they left, I pulled up the camera footage. I saw her stand up when we walked out and peek around the corner, and then throw the plate on the ground. I kept this video to myself.  
  
That brings me to this past weekend, we had our family dinner and we were joined by My in-laws, SIL & her bf as well as my parents, siblings & niece. I served everyone, saving evil SIL for last. I brought her food out on a child's plate with a sippy cup and got those kid's silverware with the plastic handles. She looked at me confused and said ""I think you mixed my plate up with your niece's plate"" and I said ""No, niece's name is responsible enough to eat on a grown up's plate. If you're going to act like a child in my home, I'm going to treat you like a child in my home."" She tried to play coy but I had my ipad ready and played the video to everyone at the table. She started sobbing, swiped the kids plate off the table and stormed out. My in-Laws both apologized and offered to pay for replacement plates but I told them not to worry about it. Despite this we still had a nice time.  
  
When everyone left my husband told me I was out of line and cruel, but I told him that this has been happening for months & I've told him it was bothering me multiple times. It's Wednesday, he's still being a little cold to me and I also got a text from my S-I-L's boyfriend asking me if I would apologize to her because ""I really embarrassed her."" I sent him the video again and he left me on read. My husband just called me to ask if I was taunting her boyfriend because his sister called him crying that I was. So, AITA?

"My (F25) (step)brother Nico (29) has recently got engaged to a woman called Jenny after dating for two years. We all tried to welcome Jenny, especially knowing that she grew up in the foster care system and didn’t have family. We tried to get to know her, but she seemed to want an instant intimate connection rather than building one. Me and my younger (step) sister Chelsea (22) bore the brunt of her neediness but our parents have also expressed concerns. 

Since she met us she has been trying to insert herself into pictures, family disputes, and social events. She has no boundaries. We’ve all talked to Nico about it so many times, even sitting him down as a family and he keeps saying he will talk to her but nothing changes, and it’s got worse since the engagement. She tried to make me her Maid of Honour, demanded my mother throw her a bridal shower, started calling my parents Mom and Dad even though they asked her not to, and reached out to distant family members that we don’t even talk to to tell them about the engagement. 

Last week we were all (Chelsea, Nico, me, and our partners) staying at our parents’ place. Jenny, Nico, and my bf were the only ones not up yet and the rest of us were in the kitchen. Chelsea, my mum, and I were talking about taking a weekend trip. Jenny came in, having overheard us, saying it sounded like fun and proceeded to invite herself along. I was pretty annoyed by this and said she couldn’t just invite herself. Jenny said why wouldn’t she be invited, and I said because marrying Nico doesn’t give you a blanket invite to every single thing all his family does. Jenny got upset and said she would really like to be included in our family, since it was the only one she knows and she doesn’t have a proper family. I said I know that and we all sympathise but that doesn’t mean we owe you a new one. 

The whole room was silent and Jenny got up and went back upstairs. She didn’t come out the rest of the day but Nico came down to chew me out over what I said. Our parents defended me saying he had an opportunity to talk to Jenny and he didn’t. He and Jenny left the same day and he’s now only keeping low level contact with everyone.

When I’ve spoken to him since he’s just said I went way too low with what I said to Jenny and that I’ve set her back mentally and that she’s really down. I do feel bad, but I also feel like Jenny has been overstepping. We are all open to a relationship with her (we all have good relationships with partners in the family) but she never really made a genuine effort to build relationships with us, she just decided she was entitled to them, which I think isn’t fair. 

I don’t know if I should reach out to Nico or Jenny with a more fervent apology, which I will if I have really screwed up here. I don’t want to be the reason Nico stops talking to us. I just feel like he dropped the ball by letting it get to this point.

Edit - okay I’m adding this because I thought it was implied but maybe not. We do push back when Jenny is being intrusive. I can’t count how many times I have said “Jenny I’m not comfortable talking about my sex life/therapy/medication etc., it’s really personal, can we just change the subject”. We move on from the conversation but the next time I talk to her it’s back to square one. Same with my parents, they politely ask her not to call them mom and dad, and she stops for the duration of that conversation, and then starts again next time. We’ve never had a more in depth conversation with her, we offered, and Nico said no, he would talk to her.

Edit 2: for everyone saying I should consider Jenny family because she’s engaged to Nico, that isn’t what I meant with that comment. I commented this elsewhere but I’m copying because it encapsulates when I was trying to get across. 

I never said or meant that she isn’t part of the family. I guess what I meant with what I said was, you can’t parachute yourself in and expect us to be the family you deserve. Because the family every person deserves is one with their mom and their dad and it’s happy and it’s from birth, and you don’t have do anything to earn it. Sadly, not everyone gets that. I know I didn’t. And I know how much it must suck for her to feel like she has to work for what other people got for free. I have a shitty bio dad, so I kind of know. You think “why do I have to be good and clever and kind and a million other things to have a good family while all anyone else has to do is just be born”, and it’s the worst. But when you come into a family that already exists that’s the way it is. They learn to love you and it takes time. My stepdad didn’t love me the second he met me, or love me just because he loved my mom, he got to know me, and figured out who I was as a person and he loved me for me. We wanted to have that opportunity with Jenny. And maybe that doesn’t feel good enough for her and I guess it’s not really fair that she doesn’t have the other kind of unconditional love but I don’t think that’s up to us, or anyone, to fix. That’s just my view.",0
"I 17m learning to drive getting on well enough, instructor said to book the test early even though I’m not quite there yet because it’s difficult to get tests at our test centre. 

Closest one was in May (you’d get cancellations though it’s not that bad) but all my exams are between may till near the end of June so I booked it for after my exams. Because I really don’t think I could do it the same week I have any exams on.

"i (16 f) and my mom (37 f) have always had a weird relationship. she wasn't a part of my life after i was 7 up until i was 12. for the past 4 years i've been living with her and things have gone downhill. she's ok every drug you can think of as well as being an alcoholic. she went to jail last year with drug charges so i was removed from her custody. we still lived together with my stepdad but he was very abusive towards us (he still ended up getting custody of me). 

on monday night, my mom and i were thrown out of my stepdads home. we went to stay at a hotel with a friend for a few days. my mom went to work tuesday morning like usual while i stayed in the hotel. the cops showed up at my room asking for my mom and her friend because someone (my stepdad) reported me as kidnapped. my stepdad has always used me as a way to hurt my mom since there was nothing she could do about it.

 i'm now living with my maternal grandmother for the time being. she thinks i should have my mom sent to rehab. my mom struggles with MS (multiple sclerosis) which is a very bad autoimmune condition. her health is deteriorating rapidly and i can tell she is struggling. i love my mom a lot and i just want what's best for her. i'm scared if i go through with it that i'll never see or hear from her again. but i'm also scared that if i do nothing, she'll get herself killed or hurt. i also don't want her to come out of rehab and go right back to what she's doing. so, any advice?",0
"I (23 F) am currently living with two girls other girls (22 F) in a 3 bedroom apartment. The two of them have been best friends for years and I joined them in this lease to move into the city. We’re all very friendly and live pretty well together, however we split the rent in a way that has me paying $200 more than one of them and $400 than the other. 

This division was originally agreed upon for a different apartment than the one we ended up in (we got outbid), where I would have had a much larger room than both of them and the sizes of our rooms would have reflected what we were paying. However, when that apartment didn’t end up working out, we found one that we liked but didn’t have that same room difference, except for one that was smaller than the other 2. I agreed to the same division because I work from home and figured I would be the one getting the most use out of the place and was desperate to move out of my parents house. Now that the lease renewal season is among us, I’ve talked with my roommates about staying in the apartment and originally agreed that I’d like to stay, but told them I will not be paying anymore in rent if it goes up, because the difference between us is so high. 

The problem now is that I have friends in the city who are moving into a house and want me to join them. This is appealing to me because 1. The house is awesome and I’d love to live with my friends and 2. It’d be substantially cheaper for me to live there. However, if I were to leave my current apartment situation, I’d be leaving my roommates out to dry due to potentially rising rent and their inability to pay more. 

I have a huge guilt complex about the idea of leaving them out to dry like this, especially because I put myself in this payment situation and agreement, but also know that they would both go for an opportunity like this if the roles were reversed and it was offered to them. So, would I be the asshole for jumping ship? ",0
"My husband had a one night stand after much counseling I decided to forgive him and work on our marriage.

Unfortunately the woman got pregnant, and they now have a 3-year-old boy. 

I have two 5-year-old French bulldogs whom I and my two kids with my husband (14f and 9m). Unfortunately being short hair dogs these kind tend to produce the most reaction in those who are allergic.

I was fully prepared to welcome this child into my home with open arms and be the best stepmother I could possibly be, as the child is innocent and he is the little brother of my two children. My husband has visitation every other weekend.

Unfortunately this child is highly allergic to dogs, and his mother is demanding that we get rid of the dogs. These dogs have been with me through thick and thin, they were there with me when I suffered severe depression over my husband cheating and my kids adore them too. 

I absolutely refuse to get rid of these dogs, I told my husband he can either do the visitation at a hotel, get a second apartment for him and his son, or we can build an in-law unit at his expense above the garage but I told him my only stipulations are that this comes out of his own pocket he may not dip into our kids college funds and the dogs stay. 

Because the child is so young he doesn't understand why he's not allowed to come to the house and feels left out as a result.

AITA for refusing to get rid of my dogs because my husband cheated? When he was hemming and hawing because he wanted to be all things to all people I told him I will divorce him well before I do away with the dogs.",0
"Throwaway because some know my OG account.
This was pre covid when this happened, but I still think about it sometimes.

Small backstory: My (23f) friend (25f) has her son and was gushing on him constantly as I knew she would. Around the same time I was able to buy a house for myself with two floors and a finished basement.

Story: Me- Me, F- Friend,J- F's son

So about a month after I moved into the house I invited F over to have some girl time. She was also kind of hounding me about seeing her son, who just started crawling.

F and J came over and were doing pretty good. We put J in the living room so he could crawl around on the carpet and not get hurt. F and I were drinking coffee at the kitchen table which was just above the living room on a slightly higher level, so F and I had an extremely good view of J and the room.
Well, the basement door must not have been fully closed as I heard the door creak open. I looked over to see J had opened the door and was about to go down the stairs.

I got up so quick so the kid wouldn't go down and I got to him just before he tumbled down the first step. The stairs were wooden so if he fell, it would most likely kill him. The event went so quick that F had to ask what happened. I told her and she immediately grabbed J from my arms. She looked him over to see if he was ok then glared towards me. 

F: What is wrong with you? Leaving the door wide open like that! J could have fallen down the stairs and gotten hurt! It would be all your fault!

I told her sorry, the door wasn't wide open and that I truly didn't know that the door wasn't fully closed. That answer wasn't good enough though.

She then began screaming about how I knew she was bringing J over and how I SHOULD (not could) have put a baby gate up in front of the basement stairs. She then started pointing out everything she thought SHOULD be baby-proofed (stairs, outlets, cabinets, etc.) in MY HOUSE. She then asked me if I would let my children live in such a house without baby-proofing anything. 
I answered by reminding F that I was sterilized the year previous, so children were not an option for me anyways.

F's yelling caused J to get scared and cry (poor kid), to which F blamed me for. They left a short time later, but it didn't stop there.

I don't use FB, but apparently F made a post about me being a b**** and putting her kid in harm's way.
A huge argument started between her family and some of our other friends who knew about the situation.
One of my friends (E) asked why I was the one who ended up saving J when it should have been F's responsibility to watch her own kid.
E ended up getting chewed out by F and the people who agreed for her (only her family).
Most of our friends called her out as having the right to worry about her child, but she shouldn't expect everyone to accomodate for her or J. Especially when it means bubble wrapping their house for her kid.

So now I am here. I'm an a**hole for not baby-proofing my own house when I knew a baby was coming over?",0
"Our office taks people to eat for on their birthdays. The birthday person always picks the place. Last week was my coworkers (Mindy) birthday. We did not get a chance to go eat for her birthday because 4/6 of our team had Covid last week. We decided we would take her to eat when we returned to work on Monday. 
Monday, I overheard my coworker (lacy) tell Mindy that we were going to go eat for her birthday on Wednesday and asked her where she wanted to go. Mindy told her that she wanted Greek. lacy agreed that was where we would go.
Greek isn’t my favorite. I will eat it if that is what others want, but I would never choose it. 
any other day, I would have sucked it up and gone because it wasn’t my day. The thing is: Wednesday was my birthday. 
Later, Lacy told me that we were going to a Greek restaurant for my and Mindy’s birthdays. 
I got upset and told lacy that it was fine, but that I would not be joining them seeing as I was not going to go eat somewhere I didn’t want to go on my birthday. Lacy told me to stop being a prissy b*** and told me to suck it up because we were going to celebrate my birthday. 
Wednesday, I came prepared with the excuse that my dad was going to take me out to lunch so that I wouldn’t get pressured to go with them. It just so happens that lacy doesn’t come into work. The rest of the team wishes me happy birthday (including Mindy) and asks me where I wanted to go eat. 
 For the record, I’m more than happy to share my birthday, I just wanted a say in the location. So I told them where and it was fine. At 12:15 Avery (other coworker) calls lacy on speaker asking if she was coming. Lacy (with a lot of snark) replies back “why are we going there? Mindy said she wanted Greek food.” Avery tells her that I picked the place. Lacy says, “but Mindy wants Greek food”
That’s when I chime in and tell them “that’s fine. Yall can go have Greek food. Have fun.”
Mindy feels bad and says I should decide. Lacy says that we are also celebrating Mindy’s birthday so we should get Greek. 
They said that we were going to the place I wanted.  Lacy doubles down and says that she’s taking care of her sisters baby and that the place I want to go to is not child friendly and that we should just go to the Greek restaurant. I point out that my place of choice doesn’t even have a bar. But that it’s not a big deal. They can go wherever they want but I will not be joining them. They decide on another location (yet another place I have expressed dislike for on a number of occasions) and pressure me to go. But at this point lacy has made me feel like crap and I want nothing to do with her. I made it very clear that I was no longer hungry and I was not going to go. I feel like I’m partly over reacting while also taking my frustration out of everyone else when it is lacy I am really upset with. Am I the asshole?",0
"We're going to Comic Con soon, and she wants to go in her partial. I'll preface by saying that I'm a huge introvert and hate the attention, but it's whatever, but I do wanna enjoy myself as well. 

But I'm almost willing to give up some of my joy so that she'll be happy, but then again, I know within an hour, she's going to get hot or tired of wearing it and then it'll just be lugging it around for the rest of the day, or making the journey back to the car (it's a good walk), and I just feel it's more hassle than it's worth. 

I have nothing against the fandom, but I also want to focus on the event rather than suit issues. I mean, we could split up and do our own thing while we're there, but I feel like I'd be an asshole in that situation as well.

"My wife(24f) and I(26m) got into an argument because she didn't think the way I spend time with my niece was acceptable. 
Context. I lived with my sister since my niece(11f) was born. Last year I've moved out on my own and in the same year I got married to my wife. Because of the rapid shift in life and work becoming more busy then ever, I haven't had the time or energy to make time for that part of my family. 
 Recently I made time to invite my niece over. No plans, just for her to come over and hang out with my wife and I. After picking her up on the way home she talked about wanting to build a snow man and a bunch of other things we thought would be fun. After getting home my wife says that while Niece and I go out to play in the snow she'll finish some chores around the house.
 Before going out Niece sees my Vr headset and shows interest so I offer to let her play it before going outside. She says yes, so.i start it up and she starts playing. 5 minutes pass and my wife comes into the room and asks why we aren't outside yet. I tell her that Niece wanted to play VR first so I let her. Wife gets upset, saying video games isn't quality time. I respond with ""we're spending time together and niece is having fun, so why does it matter?"" Wife storms off. 
Soon after niece and I do go out and make a couple of snowmen and snow angles, ect.
And after playing in the snow for 30ish minutes, Niece asks to play vr again. I say yes and she skips away to play vr in the living room. We switch back and forth trying to beat each others score in Beat Saber and stuff like that.

Fast forward. I drop Niece back off at home and come back home and my wife has a list made out for me when I walk back into the door. It's a list of things that our young guests aren't allowed to do while at our house. And on the list is no playing video games amongst other seemingly arbitrary prohibitions.
 I say "" The list is not necessary, because when I bring my family or friends over I'm going to do what we enjoy.""
She says ""that's no way to spend time with kids, doing nothing but playing video games. I like doing crafts and playing board games and other things with my siblings when they come over, why can't you do the same?""
I respond ""because we weren't raised don't those things so i didn't think to do those things, but if you offered to try some of that stuff when she was still here I would've obliged. But I'm not going to accept a list of prohibitions because you don't like our version of fun.""
The argument escalated and I maybe sorta said some mean things like ""you're too narrow minded and dull to accept that things other than what you like are fun"" 

Tl;DR
Wife imposed rules for what activities I'm not allowed to do with my nieces when they come over. I refused to accept it because it prohibits playing video games.

"My son and his wife have been staying with us for about a month now while they prepare to move in to a new place in May. My wife and I enjoy having them with us and for the most part my daughter-in-law is lovely but she is very messy. I'm retired from the army and I have always run my house to a certain set of standards and I expect them to be followed even by guests.

My son has often described his wife as someone who ""prefers clutter"" and she generally likes to have things where she can see them, but after I voiced my displeasure over the ""clutter"" in the guest bedroom they are presiding in as well as in the guest bath they use every day she did begin to decrease this amount of clutter but not to the standards I would like in my home. My DIL still leaves her makeup out in the bathroom until she gets home in afternoons because she ""runs out of time in the mornings"" to put them up. To her credit she does clean everything once she gets home, but I don't appreciate having to stare at the mess for hours until she does get home. 

I tried handling privately with my son in hopes he could talk to her, and while he did agree he mostly made excuses about her behavior equating it to a ""unstable"" homelife growing up with incompetent parents and in the foster system towards her later teen years. I admit she still is quite young at 20 but my kids knew how to clean up after themselves before they were out of elementary school.

My frustrations over the situation grew to head one day when yet again she left out makeup in the bathroom and in response I took a trash bag and placed all the makeup and everything underneath the sink that was hers as well, and then in the guest bedroom every piece of clothing she owned etc... I had no intention of actually throwing her belongings in the trash, but I wanted to show how serious I was on the matter and I thought maybe handling it how I would have handled a teenager would have given her a bit of a wake up call since she had seemed to miss out on it in her childhood. 

My DIL came home before my son and when she discovered her things in the trash bags outside of the front door I could tell she was rather shell-shocked. I didn't yell, but I was stern when I explained that her behavior had been very disrespectful and if it continued she would have to leave my house. My DIL didn't say much and just looked at me with wide eyes the whole time, and then when I was done she apologized and took all of her things back inside the room she was staying in. I could hear her crying which seemed to me to be dramatic and when my son got home he apologized for DIL's messiness but said that the way I handled the situation was ""too far."" I told him it was my house my rules. 

Now my DIL has been keeping all of her things in her car and won't even place them in the house at all. She has also become very reserved when I am around, but is completely fine around my daughters and wife. The mess stopped but now there is an awkwardness in the house.",1
"Before I start there are a couple things you need to know about me (15F) and English isn't my first language so I'm sorry if it doesn't make alot of sense.

A couple months back I had a examyear trip to Berlin I stayed in a room together with 2 friends lets call them Jenna (15F) and Carly(15F). We were in a very small hotel in a very shitty room (almost no walk space and no place to be alone). An important note about the hotel is that smoking or vaping wasn't allowed. 

We were staying there for 3 days and had to walk the entire time (7 a.m. to 10 p.m.)on the 4th day since the bus had to take a 20hr break. We had also done a lot of rather annoying activities on the first 3 days so everybody had enough of it. 

On the 4th day we had 5 hrs to do things we wanted to do. Me, Jenna, Carly and 2 other friends let's call them Jess and Eliza(also both 15F) planned to go to a supermarket and then just chill. And so we did. We went to sit in a park and everyone was on their phones. That's when I wanted to start a conversation. 

On day 3 of our trip someone was caught vaping on a photo in the hotel and the hotel owner wasn't so happy about that. He went to one of our teachers and they talked about it. The problem with the photo was that you couldn't see that the kid was actually vaping. So we got away with it. (the teacher also explained how it looked like on the photo)

So to start up a conversation I said ""I'm curious who was on that photo."" Jess said that on the photo you couldn't see his face but you could see that smoke coming from the vape. Then I said that you could see the face but not the smoke. In the end everyone started agreeing with Jess. Carly and Eliza weren't really a part of the conversation but still agreed with Jess. Anyway, me, Jess and Jenna were really going at it. Eventually Jess said that because it was 4 against 1 that most likely those 4 would be correct. Then I said ""well if were speaking about our classmates."" -I know it was a stupid comeback and it didn't make a lot of sense but that was the first thing that came to mind- Then Jenna said ""So you're calling us stupid?"" At that point I just laughed and said when did I every say that. Then we just stopped talking about it and started to walk again.

A couple weeks later I heard a guy talk about the vaping incident during one of my classes and found out that I was indeed correct and you could see his face and not the smoke. With the happy news that I had won I told Jenna and Carly about it. They just looked at each other and said ""Why can't you just let it go."" then they went on a rand about how I get defensive whenever we have an argument.",1
"I printed out a coloring page to do with my daughter. She wanted to do more so I printed two more and told her she could do one now and one after we ate dinner. I did it this way because she has a very short attention span; it’s hard to get her to color inside the lines with no white spaces left for very long.

While she was coloring my mom called me so I left her to her own devices for about 10 minutes. When I got off the phone she had colored the page I told her not to do until after dinner. She had rushed through it just like I knew she would and it looked like she had just scribbled on it.

I raised my voice at her and told her that she knows better to do something after I tell her not to do it. Then I sent her to her room for 5 minutes (4 minutes because she’s 4, one extra minute because she was still throwing a tantrum). My husband agrees this is a fair punishment but my mom says I was too hard on her. AITA?

EDIT: looks like you all think I am an asshole. I’m curious to know how many of you are parents. I love my daughter dearly, but she is very prone to tantrums and disobedient behavior, which is what I punished her for moreso than not coloring inside the lines. I only mentioned that to explain why I wanted her to wait in the first place. I should not have lost my temper, but it’s difficult when your child has broken blood vessels in her hands from banging on the door because she doesn’t want to be in time out. I don’t get days off from this, this is my life.
BTW, her father is much, MUCH harder on her. I’m the nice one ;)",1
"We, 26M and 23F rent a place from her family, said place has a swimming pool.

We have a 2.5 year old.

My brother and his girlfriend are visiting (30 and 32)

My girlfriend likes to swim in the morning from about 6-630, and then for another 10-15 minutes she swims with our daughter because it’s a good bonding experience as well as exercise for both of them.

We’ve never had any complaints from neighbours, my girlfriend isn’t exactly loud but our daughter can be, not every morning and as much noise as you’d expect from a toddler.

My brother’s girlfriend asked if we’d stop this for just while they’re staying due to noise and the fact she’s a light sleeper, plus my girlfriend spends every Sunday in the pool and she and my brother don’t feel comfortable being around her in her swimming costume (but then said “but the noise and not being able to sleep are important”) she did ask very nicely, I joked “at least she’s wearing a swimming costume while you’re here!” But I did ask my girlfriend because I know my brothers girlfriend has complained for a while about her sleeping problems.

But my girlfriend says it’s a perfectly reasonable time, citing that she’s silent till 630 and “her house so until neighbours complain!” But I just think it’s an easy request to maybe change it from 6-630 to 630-7 or something, well  she’s upset with me and things are tense but I knew had I not asked things would be awkward with family, over such a simple thing.

Aita?

**Edit; I’m trying to read and respond, I won’t be able to reply to all comments…but, swimming costume is a UK term, I call them either swimming costume or swim suit**",1
"Hello, reddit! Very nice to meet you. I'm writing to ask about an ongoing argument I've been having with my fourth daughter, who I have been told to call ""Emma"" while on this subreddit. 

In short, I've devoted myself (male, 64) to my career and future family since I was seventeen and started my first savings account, and I've managed to accrue quite a bit, but not an infinite amount of money. I have eight children, five daughters and three sons, and they've been the true lights of my life. I've paid for all of them to be properly educated, and all expenses up to their twenty-first birthdays. 

My issue is this-- when my second daughter was nineteen, she fell pregnant, and I made the decision to help her financially with the child after her twenty-first birthday. I've been supporting her family since, and eventually made the rule that as long as any of my own children had a child, the financial support would continue until said child turned twenty-one. The amount I pay includes rent, food, tuition, and a modest monthly recreation fund. 

Since then, five of my children have started families, all early, and so I've continued to support them. My youngest daughter is not yet twenty-one, so she's covered as well, but my fourth daughter, Emma, and my youngest son, have not had any children. Emma has taken umbrage with this. She is married and considers her pets to be her children. However, her pets do not require tuition, or a recreation budget, or extra money to live in a child-friendly area. She claims that I am pushing her into having children she does not want, as she is ""childfree."" I just feel as though, as a college-educated woman with a two-income home and very few responsibilities, she is able to take care of herself. My youngest son has not made any complaints. Emma says that this is favoritism, and I'm trying to force a lifestyle on my kids. 

I do not believe I'm in the wrong here, but my youngest son has guided me here to get a less biased opinion. Well then, reddit, am I the asshole?",1
"I (29M) manage one of 3 teams of 5 people, all working under 1 director. I am a new hire (also first time managing a team like this ever), and there is a member on my team (34F) who is a bit of a loud mouth.

She doesnt seem to care about speaking her mind, to me or her coworkers, which Im not particularly okay with, but she does her work and nobody really seems to have that much of a problem with it.

One thing I do not and can not stand is when she talks rudely to the director (My fucking boss!!).

I understand, sometimes the things he asks of us are not fair, sometimes there is just too much fking work, hes gotten upset with the group too, but its just not okay.

The director is pretty laissez-faire with his management approach, so even when he assigns a butt load of work, if we dont finish it seems for the most part other than a bit of some passive aggressive remarks he gives us extensions.

Ive told her plenty of times she doesnt need to speak up when these things happen, its my place to decide if something needs to be said about too much work or something like that, but she always does it anyway.

She must have been having a really bad week, because we had another conference and bossman was being a bit passive aggressive, so she decided to do it back to him. It was a really uncomfortable call and to make a long story short, she basically summed up that he was a lazy and inconsiderate asshole (not exact words but pretty much that).

I honestly get it, I do, he is a bit of a dick but at the end of the day he is the fucking boss, and he is MY boss. Her actions directly reflect on me, her manager. I told her she needs to stop and she said that she was doing my job by telling him when enough is enough. I should make those decisions, and I have, there have been plenty of times where I put my foot down and said its just too much.

I told her she needs to either shut up and just talk to me about it, or she needs to rethink her future with the company.

She's talked about it w her coworkers, I can tell they are a bit upset with me because they feel like Im siding with him rather than them. I just need them to understand that I cant have them talking to OUR boss like that, its just not right. I need this job too just like them. AITA?",1
"Just for a bit of background, I (24M) am an Australian born Chinese only child and my parents (55F and 64M) are Chinese migrants. I've been with my girlfriend (19F) for 6 months now and we love each other so much.  


Recently, I've been having troubles with my girlfriend because of the problems I have with my relationship with my parents. My girlfriend is originally from Canada but she came here to Sydney to study and she is staying here to study for the next 3 years. She says that she might consider moving back to Canada if she cannot sustain living here since she has more opportunities for her there. I was pretty willing to move there with her after 3 years if things went well still.  


However, my Asian parents both expressed their disapproval of me migrating to Canada. They said they were tolerant of other things but this was the only thing they didn't want me to do. I discussed options for them but they wouldn't budge on it and so I when I told my girlfriend about it she felt upset since she thinks I'd choose them over her. This problem led to her being more distant from me and I could see that she was disappointed about it. I on the other hand, am willing to move out with her however, I still feel slight guilt about leaving my parents behind. They told me one of the main reasons they didn't want me to move out was because they would have no one to take care of them if they had any illness or injuries as they got older. They've also said things like ""we've raised you for 24 years and now you want to leave after everything we've done for you and taken care of you"" and stuff.  


Fast forward to today, and I'm now planning on moving out with my girlfriend to her place in Sydney for a bit (maybe at least 3 months). I will be moving my stuff over quietly overnight and plan to leave on Monday and stay over at hers. I will leave a note behind saying that I am moving out and to only contact me if there is an emergency.  


But, a part of me still feels that guilt of leaving them behind right now. They've still been taking care of me, well moreso my mum who always treats me well even to this day. She would ask me what's wrong and give her advice on things as well.  


I want to know if anyone else has faced something similar to this and what exactly I should do. Am I doing the right thing here or are there other options I can consider. I love my girlfriend so much but my relationship with my parents has been affecting ours too much. I just feel guilt over leaving my parents, I guess mostly for my mum since she's still been so caring to me up until this day. I would love some advice on how I should approach this.",1
"I (M19) was out getting lunch with my friend Sabrina (F21) yesterday, and since what happened, I've been called a troll, asshole, sexist, and just flat-out rude, and I need feedback. Anyway, we were at panera before my next class, and the conversation came up about our families. I had started talking about my dad (M48) and how comfortable I felt with the dude, specifically getting to talk with him about some of my interpersonal issues or gym journey. Sabrina said that was great, and she could relate with how comfortable she is around her mom (F52). I asked what she meant.

I wish I was joking when I say this next part, but Sabrina literally told me that she can be naked around her mom and vice versa, without it being weird or uncomfy. I asked if Sabrina was being serious, and she literally said it can be normal for them to just walk in on each other like that and nobody ever says anything. I chuckled under my breath, and Sabrina asked what the deal was. I said I wasn't trying to judge, but that was literally her own mother naked, and that they were both just seeing each other's private parts like that.

Sabrina was legit PISSED, saying that that was her mother and that it's not weird for them, but she also doesn't consider it wrong if other families think it is. I said that it's just really improper and concerning, and that Sabrina's mom shouldn't be seeing her ""baby making tools"" like that. Now I can admit that might've been too snarky, and Sabrina stormed off. And I later ended up getting bamboozled by texts from our mutual friends, calling me disgusting, a shitty friend, a pig, and just blunt. I really don't think I was being a dick, I was honestly just trying to voice my concerns. Still, AITA?

EDIT: I'm not trying to come off like an asshole, I really am just trying to understand. I've texted Sabrina twice by now asking if she wants to talk and she still hasn't gotten back to me. And from what I'm seeing, some women here are legitimately okay with their fathers seeing them naked. And even vice versa. How are you going to be okay with your own FATHER especially seeing you like that? Jesus, people out here acting like I'm the weird one.

EDIT 2: Sabrina got back to me, and is willing to talk tonight. She said she doesn't fault for me having different views, but she faults me for how I went about it. I told Sabrina I definitely didn't need to say certain things, but I really am just trying to get it. It's not like I'm trying to be a jerk, nudity's objectively taboo and illegal for most of the world. You don't see naked people randomly walking around a lot, and I'm just not used to the idea of a parent seeing their kid naked like that. I'm an old child if that matters, I don''t know. Sabrina also told me that her mom's helped her put on tampons in the past and that they've even SHOWERED together on vacation this YEAR. I don't know, I'll go into the talk with an open mind but maybe I might not be able to ever understand all of this 100%.

EDIT 3: I ended up talking with Sabrina, and I apologized if I came off as too quick to judge. She said I was all good, and even understood my confusion. She explained that ever since she was a kid, her mom has just been comfy being fully naked around her, and Sabrina started to do the same. She said that her mom had helped her with tampons a few times in the past, helped shave her pubic hair (WTF), and apparently she's even talked about her sex life to her mom before? That part especially shocked me, but Sabrina said it was just normal to her. She even said she finds it beautiful how her mom and her can be naked and vulnerable to each other like that, and it's okay for me not to get it. And honestly, I still don't. I still have many questions on how people are able to be okay with that. Either way, maybe I'll understand one day. Or I won't. ",1
"I (M26) have had this friend (M24) since I was like 5. Since he was a kid, 90% of his friends have been women. In group chats, he freely says things like ""men are trash"" and ""why do men do ____?"" To me, it comes across as pretty performative and white knighting. I privately talked to him about it, and this is what he had to say:

""I genuinely do not like interacting with most guys. I hate the constant bigotry, the toxic masculinity, the cynicism, etc. I want to talk about fashion, beauty, crushes, family, and so on. Most guys look at me like an idiot if I want to have these discussions or really anything deep. And I hate how everything is like a competition to them. Beyond that, men just scare me for reasons I do not want to disclose.""

I told him that if it seems like he cannot get along with an entire gender, this is a huge red flag. He said, ""There is absolutely nothing wrong with being more comfortable around women."" I explained that it becomes a problem when he refuses to talk to a big chunk of the population, and he said, ""I already gave you several reasons as to why I like women better. If you think this is some kind of major psychological issue, let it go instead of telling me how to live my life.""

It has been hours, and we have not talked to each other since. He always acts like that when any guy criticizes him in some way. AITA? This kind of thinking cannot be mentally healthy.",1
"I (18m) was travelling to my home country. On my second connecting flight, which is also by far my longest one being over 12 hours long, I had the delightful sight of an obese man that was taking up a good chunk of my seat.

I am not a small guy myself. I have quite broad shoulders and am around 190 cm, so a full seat would already have been uncomfortable. I told the flight attendant about this issue and she told me that the seat was paid for by this obese person and the flight was full.

I asked the flight attendant how it’s possible that my seat still rendered as available if it was being used for someone’s literal rolls, as this wasn’t an american airline (non-american airlines don’t get overbooked).

I then added on how this airline wasn’t absolutely terrible just a few years ago (it wasn’t just this incident they just went downhill in quality).

These comments prompted the flight attendant to call me rude and just made her double down on me getting kicked off the plane, though she reassured me I’d be compensated for this trouble as I told her I wasn’t travelling for vacation.

The fat man took his opportunity to call me a fatphobic shit. Some other people around gave me the stink eye. I know they think I’m a bad person for this, but on the other hand I’m having to pay for the lack of discipline of another person as well as this shitty airline’s booking system. Hell I’d rather they called me the day before.

The airline staff sent a letter of complaint that I got appealed and the consequences in the complaint (being a temporary ban) were removed less than an hour later. In the letter of complaint it said I was being rude to other passengers and the staff.

Since it got appealed so quick, and I got to travel the next day anyway, I’m really not sure if I’m TA.

AITA for my comments that have offended both the fat man and the airline staff?",1
"My son (4) had a sleepover last night with a friend. This friend's parents were doing my wife and I a huge favor, because my wife's father had surgery yesterday, and we needed to be there and didn't get home until after midnight. So yes, this story begins with us already in debt to them. Anyway, at naptime today my son started freaking out because he couldn't find sleepy Dumbo (his stuffed animal) and he *cannot* sleep without sleepy Dumbo.

I remembered that when I picked him up I didn't see sleepy Dumbo. So I text the mom and dad of the friend. I get no response. My wife is a wreck, so I'm not bothering her with this, but my son is freaking out. So I tell him we will get in the car and go get sleepy Dumbo and he slightly calmed down. So we drive over and I try to call them both on the way.

When we get there, I knock, and we wait a bit with no answer. At this point my son starts freaking out more because he is afraid something happened to sleepy Dumbo. I try to reassure him, but he starts crying. I knock again, and the wife of the couple answers. She says she is working and asks what I want. I explain about sleepy Dumbo.

She again says she is working, and she says she doesn't have time to look for Dumbo and tells us to come back later. My son starts freaking out more. I ask if we can look. She says she needs to focus. I promise to be fast. She lets me in.

We get to his friend's room, sleepy Dumbo is on the bed. My son gets him, and I hustle us out. I thank the mom, but she is glaring at me. On the way home he hugs sleepy Dumbo the whole time. I remind him to be more careful with sleepy Dumbo in the future, and at home naptime commences peacefully.

About an hour ago my wife and I both got this text. I'm going to copy paste it:

{Me} and {my wife} I really don't appreciate the way {me} barged into my house earlier today while I was working. I know you both have a lot going on right now but the world doesn't revolve around you. {Her husband} and I agreed to do you a favor but that doesn't mean you get to just walk all over us. In the future if you call and we don't answer that means it isn't a good time to come over.

I felt very embarrassed and guilty after reading that. My wife, however, is furious. She called the wife of the other couple some indelicate names. I am really grateful to them for agreeing to babysit for us, and I accept that I am to blame for forgetting sleepy Dumbo the first time. I don't know if asking to come in and get him is quite as big a deal as she's making it out though, and my wife is pissed. I don't know how much of that is misplaced fear for her dad though. Am I an asshole, or was this just an unfortunate situation?",1
"One of my best friends is this guy named Jack and we've been friends since the first grade. We're in the 8th grade now and I'm really worried that I'm going to lose him to this kid named Allan who's new to our school this year. Allan's an annoying little asshole and me and him get into arguments a lot. We have choir class together (I only joined choir because I thought there was a free Disney trip, but it got cancelled) and we're always fighting and insulting each other. The problem is that Allan and Jack have started to become friends. 

They hang out together after school and now Jack has even started sitting with him at his lunch table with all of his friends. He's apparently too good to sit with us and it especially pissed me off on Friday. I overheard one of the girls at the table inviting Jack to a party next weekend and I was upset. While Allan and Jack were sitting by each other, I sent Jack a text that said ""Having fun with your little butt buddy?"" That pissed off Jack and he marched over to our table and starting yelling at me. He kept screaming ""What the fuck is wrong with you?!"" and people were staring. 

Now Jack is pissed off at me and I'm worried that it's because Allan is turning him against me. There's also a rumor going around that Allan is gay and I'm worried that Jack is going to get turned on to that. I only sent that text to wake Jack up and make him realize that I'm his best friend and that he can't just go over to Allan and the popular kids. We were supposed to hang out since we had the day off from school, but I saw on Instagram that Jack hung out with Allan. I just want my friend back on my side. AITA?",1
"

My wife is a grade A+ picky eater. It's bothersome to a certain degree but on holidays basically the shitshow begins. She'd refuse to eat certain meals and mom would take it personally...which results in a series of arguments between them.


As a compromise this year, My wife offered to bring her own food to thanksgiving dinner. I was stunned I asked if she thought this through and she looked at me confused. I told her about how weird it'd be for her to bring her own food especially when she woudln't be sharing it with anybody else, and told her to think about how mom will react. She'd get very offended and upset. My wife said that it's not her problem and that she was just trying to make it work by bringing her own meal. I told her again that mom might not like nor even allow this. She blew up at me asking if I want her to either eat food she doesn't like or go hungry. I suggested she give my mom's food a chance but she said it wasn't about my mom's cooking, she just doesn't like certain foods. We had an argument and I ended up telling she could stay home this thanksgiving and have whatever meal she likes. She got quiet then lashed out on me calling me insensitive and negative to say this to her. I repeatedly asked her to calm down but she couldn't stop ranting about how I was basically willing to exclude her from a major event.

She started cold shouldering me about it while at the same time guilting me saying I'm treating her poorly after she offered the ""perfect compromise"".


Update: And so, my wife has decided to go spend thankgiving with her family (who by the way live HOURS away, so this means unnecesary travel expenses) instead and basically ditch me for a whole week. Y'all happy now? Though I appreciate some insightful comments on the situation. Some others?.....not so much especially with those assumptions claiming that my wife has allergies, SHE DOES NOT! Y'all get that from? But anyway. S'all good now I guess though I'm not too thrilled with her decision. I feel like she's doing it to spite me or get me to cave in.",1
"My BF (33M) and I (29F) have been dating for 3 years.  He owns a house and lives there by himself.  I live in an apartment by myself.  We've talked about moving in together as that's the logical next step in our relationship and we both want to do it.  But I have some hang-ups related to moving into a house that I don't have any stake in.  

I am refusing to pay any money that would go directly towards his mortgage.  I don't have any stake in the house, why would I contribute to his mortgage payments?  I'm ok helping with utilities, groceries, household items, etc. But paying his mortgage is a hard no from me.  I just don't think it makes any sense for me to pay towards his mortgage when I would get nothing from that if we were to break up.  

His argument is that I would essentially be living with him for free and it would cause an uneven dynamic in our payment towards shared living expenses.  Which, I kind of get, but at the same time he's the one benefitting from paying down the mortgage and gaining equity, not me.  He also argued that his mortgage is pretty much exactly what I was paying in rent, so by cutting that in half I am saving a lot of money on living costs compared to living on my own.  Which, yeah, that's nice too, but legally it's still not my house.

I told him the only way I would pay money for ""rent"" is if he signs a contract with me stating that any money I pay towards his mortgage will be paid back to me, by him, in the event that we break up.  It would also allow me protection from eviction and other basic tenant rights, similar to a rental agreement.  He is refusing to sign anything like that because, in his words, I could break up with him for no reason and then take him to court for thousands of dollars.  Which, I suppose is true but I wouldn't just break up with him for no reason.

This whole situation is driving a wedge between us and he's pissed at me for ""being so difficult"" when all he thinks he is asking is that we split living expenses 50-50 if we are to live together.  To me, it's not that simple when he's the one owning the house we would live in.  If I were on the title, it would be a different story, but he's not willing to put me on the title because he's lived there for 7 years already.  

My lease at my apartment is up in 2 months and I know I need to make a decision sooner than later.  It doesn't help that my landlord is going to be increasing my rent, and similar apartments in our area are going for even more than I'm currently paying.  But I just don't feel right contributing money towards his mortgage.  I also know that if I renew my lease, it's pretty much a dagger to our relationship, which I don't want because I do love him and see a future with him.  I just want to make sure I'm protected.

I can tell my BF's patience on this is wearing thin and he's upset with me for digging my heels in on this.  But for me, this is about protecting myself for the worst-case scenario while he's not really risking anything.",1
"I've recently found myself in a whirlwind of family drama, and I'm honestly unsure if I've done the right thing.

My great-grandmother left behind a valuable family heirloom - a vintage grand piano. In her will, she bequeathed it to me specifically, stating that she wanted me to have it due to my deep passion for music. I've been playing the piano since I was a child, and she always appreciated my connection to it. 

However, my current living situation doesn't allow for such a large item. I live in a small apartment in the city, and the piano has been in storage for the last 5 years, incurring monthly storage fees. Recently, I've faced some financial hardships, and after careful consideration, I decided to sell the piano. I used the money to pay off some debts and set aside a portion for my future, possibly for a down payment on a house.

When my family found out, they were furious. Many feel that the piano should've remained in the family and passed down to future generations. They argue that its sentimental value far outweighs any monetary gains.

I understand their sentiments, but I also felt burdened by the costs of storage and the practicalities of my situation. The piano wasn't being used or enjoyed, and I believed selling it was a beneficial decision for my future.

So, AITA for selling the family heirloom, even though it was legally mine?",1
"I'm getting married next spring to my fiancé (30M), who has primary custody of his 5 year old daughter, Chloe. Chloe's bio mom is in and out of the picture, but has only seen her a handful of times this year, and last year was the same. Chloe's mom is now with another man and has two other children (aged 1 and 2). She does not pay child support.

Since we've been engaged, I've been nudging my fiance to get a paternity test for Chloe. He and Chloe's mom broke up because she was cheating on him, and he acknowledges there's a possibility Chloe isn't biologically his. I just want proof she's his before we get married. I'm not sure what I would do if she wasn't his, but I feel like I should be allowed to know the full situation since I'm paying for half her upbringing.

AITA?",1
"My two friends and I (all 38F) always meet up for our birthdays every year. We exchange presents and do a group activity + a meal. The birthday girl gets treated to everything.

My birthday is at the end of this month. I sent a group text to my friends with the restaurant I want to go to and asked if a specific date works for everyone. Sarah said she won't be here. So I asked what about another weekend? And apparently she is going to be away for a few months. She said to just celebrate without her.

I felt pretty offended that she would choose to vacation during my birthday, I feel like it is a slight. Plus Sarah has been acting weird and talking to me less for months now. I texted her and asked if everything was OK and I am a straightforward person so I told her directly, ""I feel like you have been avoiding me, why else would you purposefully go away for my birthday?""

Sarah immediately got defensive and annoyed. She said I am a hypocrite because I went away for her birthday weekend last year and you didn't hear her complain, plus I am always a diva when it comes to our other friend's birthday, and overall she needs a break from our friendship because she just doesn't think I have been a good friend. So I am not talking to her now. She has a lot of animosity towards me for no reason. AITA for getting upset she is ditching me on my birthday?

Edit: A lot of people are confused, I never SKIPPED her birthday last year. I just was unavailable on her birthday weekend because I was going away on vacation. We celebrated her birthday a month later.",1
"I (29f) am currently 14 weeks pregnant. My boyfriend (30m) and I were discussing baby names and I threw one out that I liked. It's not a particularly weird name in America but it's not the easiest to pronounce. My boyfriend said we couldn't name our baby that because there is no way his mother would be able to pronounce it correctly.

My boyfriend is not American and has been here for about 4 years. He speaks English fairly well but can be very difficult to understand at times (texting is even worse, lol). His mother still lives back where he is from.

Here's the thing, I don't really care about the particular name I threw out, but I said to him I didn't really think it mattered if she could pronounce it ""correctly"" or not. My boyfriend doesn't pronounce MY name ""correctly"" and I don't give a shit or correct him. I know I for sure do not say his quite right but I try. We get on just fine. I just don't feel like it's a big deal. I told him as much and he said it was a big deal and stormed off. AITA?

Edit: Y'all, we know that babies names are a ""two yes one no"" situation, of course. This may or may not be a helpful addition because it's not really the point of the post, but one of the problems here is that this baby is going to be raised in America and his language is very different from english. Almost no names from his country would be pronounced correctly in America. My boyfriend goes by a name he straight up MADE UP socially and professionally for this reason. We want the baby to be connected to their heritage but if we choose a name from his language it could make their life more difficult and be endlessly mispronounced. The point being, if we choose a name his overseas family can say easily, people here will mess it up and vice versa. So that's just some bigger context to the situation.",1
"My (30M) brother-in-law (19) stays with us while finishing his degree. Last wednesday, We were not able to run our errand and do our usual routine because we were waiting for him to wake up and do his laundry as he told us he would do it early morning because he will party the next day. Noon came and he didnt do any of his chores. Come friday, He had a night out and asked us that he would stay the night at a friend’s house. he was asked to come home early morning to do his chores and while we are still at home as my wife and I had errands and he doesnt have house keys. We didnt receive any updates from him that morning so we left at 9AM. He went home at 1PM and was raged to find the house locked. 


For context: He goes out every Friday to party and comes home the next day at around noon time even if we repeatedly ask him to come home at a certain time. he also ditches his own chores because of hang over and lack of sleep. This habit went on for years and when my MIL found out, she was pissed as the allowance she’s been giving generously goes to alcohol and party expenses. My wife prepares us food packs for snack and lunch which is a big save for my BIL. Admittedly, we were the enablers of this behaviour as we hope to give him freedom. After talks and compromises, my MIL suggested that the house key be surrendered so curfew (12MN) can be imposed effectively.",1
"K has always been treating me like I'm her kid up at work for a long time, I'm 23 and I told K ""I'm not your kid don't talk down to me or treat me as such back off."" K starts crying and my coworkers are asking me questions why I said what I said, my response was I was fed up with her, AITAH?",1

 Been together almost 2 years and we play our roles of masculinity and feminine energy pretty well.. I’m texting her while she is out having brunch but I wanna text her a little something raunchy and to see if there is any sex to look forward to 
This is the convo:

Me: I have a question 

My gf: what?

Me: aye watch that “what shit”

My gf: yes?

Me: are you gunna give me head when you get here?

My gf: is that what you want?

…..
So I didn’t reply and she puts the little !! Thing on her message but I’m like “Idk why you putting that because your answering a question with a question…”

Update: everyone in the comments is insulting me because I said “watch that shit”.. obviously my gf doesn’t have a problem with the way that I corrected her rudeness.. she immediately changed her behavior and said ‘yes’ which is more polite and I respect her for that..
The post is AITA for not responding.. saying watch that shit to my gf isn’t rude and neither me or her think so. Get off your high horses",1
"I40m have been married to my wife 35f for 8 years. We have a 4 year old son together, and I have a 15 year old son, and 12 year old daughter from a previous relation. We get them three days out of the week. I work 5 days a week, 12+ hours at a hospital, constantly on my feet. My wife works from our living room as a nail and eyelash tech, only the days she has clients. Some days she’ll have between 1-3 clients a day, other days she will have none and be free all day. There will be nights I’ll be so exhausted and ask my wife for one thing, and she’ll grunt and she’ll moan how tired she is. The other day she had one client, and she was refusing to bathe our 4 year old, who shouldn’t of even been awake still when I got home from work.  She complained how she didn’t want to do it. I basically just told her to stop acting so tired because she has the luxury of picking when she works and gets to be home. She got really angry and said she has no luxury because even when she has no clients she has to clean, cook, and take care of the kids.
My two kids are at school til 2 everyday, and she gets to decide when to pick up our 4 year old from vpk. I told her basically what she was complaining about was doing the bare minimum, and again she needed to stop acting so tired. She then accused me of being ungrateful for what she does, and told me not to talk to her, and has been sleeping in our guest room for the past 3 nights.

I do appreciate my wife dearly, I tell her all the time, I buy her gifts, because after working this many hours I cldnt come home and clean and take care of the kids. I lift people, run through the hospital, take care of patients all day, I am tired, and I feel as though she isn’t recognizing how easy she has it. Aita?",1
"They are 11 and 13. I've noticed her telling them the wrong information at times, or missing out crucial information from instructions and i believe it is to make them fail. I've noticed this pattern and begun to watch.

For example, they have afro hair and she insists on brushing out all of their knots when their hair is dry, before they get in the shower. They sit silently but they have pain across their faces as she tugs at their knots. I mentioned this at work and one of my colleagues said her daughters should brush their hair when it's wet with conditioner on as the knots will slide out. I noticed that my wife does this to her hair, but still insists her daughters sit and get their hair brushed out?

One of her daughters wanted to bake a cake, and my wife laughed to me afterwards as she said she missed out a crucial step in the recipe and her daughter was upset when she failed - it really bothered me as it seemed to give my wife a sense of satisfaction to leave her daughter to struggle and watch her fail?

One of her daughters didn't like one of my wife's that she had cooked (she's insisted the whole family follow her strict diet), and my wife then 'punished' her silently by ordering her many ready meals and putting her on a ready meal diet for the next month, without any explanation? 

I gently approached my wife with this and she is now giving me the silent treatment. AITA?",1
"Okay, some back story is needed here to set the scene. We rent a property on acreage where we live and I keep my horses, including 2 stallions (intact males, for those who don’t know). Horses in general, especially stallions, need certain types of fencing in order to be safe. The property we rent has great fencing, 5 foot tall wire mesh with railroad tie fence posts, which is very safe and secure. 

A couple years ago, new neighbors moved in from the city and they had their property lines surveyed to confirm the boundaries to put up a new fence. The survey concluded that our shared fence line is to be moved 20 feet into our pasture. We spoke about their plans last weekend, and they said the property owner we rent from left it up to the neighbors to work with us on the fencing. The neighbors plan to replace the fence with a different mesh not rated for livestock, with a mix of cheaper, 6-inch diameter wood posts and metal t-posts, which are notoriously dangerous for horses. I’ve personally known 3 people whose horses impaled themselves on these metal posts, one fatally. 

My question is: would I be the asshole for telling them, “since you’re the ones who want to replace the fence, you’ll need to replace the fence back the way it was at your expense. Because it’s either that, or I sue for the vet bills or loss of a horse when one of my horses gets hurt or breaks through the cheaply done fence.”",1
"Burner account. I(29F) am married to ""Nate""(29M) and his sister his ""Denise""(29F) we are all childhood friends and I married Nate almost a year ago. Denise, at the time was 7 months pregnant with her first child, her husband is ""Wayne""(30M). Not too long after our reception started, Denise went into preterm labor. Her pregnancy up until that point was not high risk so this was completely out of nowhere and stunned all of us. She understandably had to leave with Wayne to the hospital and most of their side of the family left out of concern. She insisted we stay and have fun and lord knows Nate and I tried but knowing that she was in unexpected, high risk labor was at the forefront of our minds and we made the difficult decision to end the reception about  an hour and a half early and joined up at the hospital.

My nephew ""Ben"" was born that night and we were all excited but I'll admit Nate and I felt a bit miffed that our wedding day was kind of stolen by this event. We kept this to ourselves though, as this was obviously unplanned and it's cruel to put that on Denise and Wayne. But, from that point on nobody ever talked about our marriage, just baby Ben. The times I think a relative mentioned our wedding can be counted on one hand. I get it, new additions to the family are ultimately more important but my wedding day will never just be about my wedding, it'll be about Ben, and whenever he comes up  or I see him I feel bitter because I'm reminded of what happened at the wedding. Yes, I know I'm jealous of a baby. I feel like shit for it. Nate was like this too for a while but grew out of it, I'm still working on it.

Ben is turning 1 in 2 weeks and that's all everyone's talking about, not a peep about our anniversary. I already know I'll just be depressed and mopey the whole time so I asked if Nate could politely tell him I would not be there. He did and Denise was pretty upset and demanded to know why, he refused, so she confronted me via text. She told me that she's picked up on how I seem sad whenever Ben is mentioned and said I'm hurting her that I can't tell her why. I decided to be honest and tell her that I've been very depressed(not just for this issue, but it's contributing) and that I felt that my wedding was overshadowed by her unexpected labor. I did tell her I'm not mad at anyone because it was unplanned, I just need to not be reminded of it on my anniversary. She did not respond and just blocked me, but Wayne uninvited Nate and told him to keep him and I far away from his family. Nate's confused and I feel like shit. AITA? ",1
"   Long time lurker, first time poster here. This one is not mind blowing or Extreme, but I felt compelled to post it because I really cannot decide who's right here. It's bothered me for a minute and I can see both sides, and thought you all might be able to figure this one out. (Or maybe it is straight up me...idk?)

   A while back I went to a small family gathering with my wife. It was my family mind you and only 3 or 4 members. We all went to grab food at a small boutique sandwich shop that was known for making some really good simple food but not quite your average sandwich. My wife and I each ordered a sandwich with similar sounding names and slightly different ingredients.

  We return home, and I start passing out the sandwiches while my wife is using the bathroom. They all have similar wrappings and such and look VERY similar to each other, so as you can guess, I accidentally take my wife's sandwich and start eating it thinking it was the one I ordered. 

   I'm telling everyone how good it is when she returns to find that I just finished hers, and the one I ordered is the only one left. 

   Naturally, she blows up at me and makes a big scene about me eating her sandwich. At first, I felt terrible (and still do, mind you) I was apologizing sincerely, and even offered to go get her another one.

   But then for the rest of the ENTIRE day, not only my wife, but my entire family is raging and jumping down my throat about what an awful person I am, really to the extreme, like I ruined the entire vacation for everyone.

   Eventually I had enough, and I blew up. I went off on them all about how I had made a simple human mistake and tried to apologize for it, and now they are acting like overgrown CHILDREN throwing a tantrum and crying because they didn't get the EXACT sandwich they wanted! It showed just how spoiled and entitled they had all become because it was such a disaster they didn't get exactly what they wanted, how and when they wanted it, and I told them all to **** off and grow up and stop crying over a stupid sandwich. 

   Long story little less long, they all still are p***** off at me and treat me like a bad guy. 

  So, like I said I can see both sides, I get it's frustrating. 

  But AITA for being careless and not paying attention? Or are they the bigger A**, for overreacting and throwing a huge fit over something (I think) is so small? 

Thanks to all who actually read this dumb thing and take the time to reply.",1
"My mother died when I (25F) was 19 and my sisters were 16 and 15. I have no words to explain the pain. For the first few months I wanted to actually die. Had to stop college because I couldn’t get out of my bed. Therapy helped. I still have bad days but I guess life goes on.  

After me, my therapist and dad all agreed I was well enough I went back to college. College was three hours away by plane so I didn’t go home much. Still talk to my father and sisters daily. 

2 years after my mom died my dad met a woman I will call Lily. They started dating and got married 2 years later. My sisters tell me she is nice. They had a few problems in the beginning when she tried to parent them which was not well received by a 18 and a 17 year old. They both felt (and I agreed) that my parents had already raised us and her input was not necessary or wanted (specially since a few things she tried were different from the way mom and dad raised us). They told dad and he told Lily firmly but politely that he was the parent and he would make the decisions where me and my sisters were concerned. No more problems after that.       

But I just couldn’t. For me Lily is just a walking, talking reminder my mom is gone. I know it’s not fair to her but I just can’t, really. Talked with my therapist and dad. Explained. He told Lily that while I wish her all the best, I'm not open to the idea of a relationship with her. She seemed to understand. 

I barely hear anything about her nowadays. Only when my sisters really want to say something to me and there is no way not to include her. When I go home I stay with my grandparents and if she is joining us for something I suddenly have plans with old friends, sorry. My dad and sisters only visited me once, when I graduated. Could only invite a certain number of people and I have a big family besides my dad and sisters. They took priority so she did not go.

Basically, I haven’t met Lily in the four years she and dad have been together. Never even talked to her. Dad understands and the rest of my family or understands or doesn’t care. 

Well, last week I got a call from an unknown number. It was Lily. She was clearly upset. Said it has been years and that she is a part of my dad’s life and I was selfish for excluding her from one of the three most important things for him (me and my sisters). She said she wants to at least be my friend. Went on and on about not being fair to her that I don’t want anything to do with her. 

When I finally got to talk I was a mess so I only said “You are a part of my dad’s life, yes. You are his wife. And that’s all you are to me. I’m sorry but I have no interest in meeting you or talking to you again. Bye.” Finished the call and went to sleep. Slept for 14 hours.  

Apparently, she is unconsolable. Told my dad what happened. He didn’t know she would call. Dad is upset but understands. My boyfriend says I was completely in the right. But Lily absolutely thinks I’m the asshole. AITA, reddit?",1
"It's a messed up conflict between my brother and my husband and by extension me.


So, My (f30) brother ""Jacob, m33"" and my husband ""Connor, m32"" have been friends since college. I met Connor through Jacob. they were so close and are always in agreement but that changed once Jacob's fiancee ""Rachel"" came around.


Connor told me that Rachel used to be this ""fun"" girl that slept with nearly everyone in the group. Jacob met her at the new company and they began officially dating. I too was shocked when I heard cause Connor told me about her a lot about her ""glorious college days"". Jacob then announced his engagement to Rachel and invited us for the engagement party. Connor had talks with Jacob about if he was sure he wanted to settle down with her and Jacob told him to drop it and Connor did.


At the party, I was sitting next to Connor talking about random stuff. Suddenly Rachel's phone started ringing and she excused herself to answer. While she was getting up, Connor looked at her and Jacob and smirked and said ""I'm telling ya, you can't make a hoe a housewife!"". Rachel stormed off and Jacob unloaded on Connor calling him an obnoxious asshole, Connor just stared as Jacob kept insulting him with name calling. I didn't want to get involved til Jacob tried to kick Connor out of the party. I said to Jacob that he overreacted and should calm down but he acted appaulled that I ""defended"" Connor but I told him that he at least wasn't lying. Jacob then proceeded to kick me out as well. Mom got involved and tried to calm us down but Connor grabbed his keys and phone and told me to follow him.


We felt terrible, Connor started crying in the car and I called mom and said while Jacob overreacted, Connor was out of line to say this infront of Rachel and make her cry on her engagement party amd I shouldn't have sided with him. She told me to reach out to Jacob to apologize but I said that he insulted my husband who happens to be his BEST FRIEND, then escalated by kicking him out. I refused to call Jacob and felt upset for being made feel bad for siding with my husband who's hurt because of what his best friend did to him.

AITA? I really thought it was an inside joke between them.",1
"My ex husband and I share custody of our 10 year old daughter and 12 year old son. We have a 2-2-3 schedule which usually looks like I have the kids Friday after school and then he gets them Monday after school. I get them back Wednesday after school and then he gets them Friday after school and then the week flip flops. We've done this since our divorce 5 years ago and it works well. I'm a nurse in the OR so I schedule my shifts for the days during the week when they are with their dad and my one call weekend every 6 weeks is a weekend they are with their dad. 

Recently, the kids said they want to try splitting up on the weekends, so instead of both of them being with one us during the weekend, one will go with dad and one will be with me. My son said he would make sure he was with me on call weekends because he can stay by himself if I have to get called in or can hang out at the hospital until I'm done. My ex is on board with this because he says it will allow us to spend one on one time with the kids and will allow the kids a break from each other (they squabble occasionally and annoy one another). While they have a point- sometimes it is hard to not feel like you are disappointing one by trying to accommodate the other, I do not want to give up my free weekends. It took me a few months to get used to not having my kids all the time after the divorce but now my weekends without them are filled with activities or travel. My ex agreed if there was a weekend trip I wanted to take he would be fine having both the kids that weekend but I honestly don't want to have to take his schedule into consideration when planning my trips, and sometimes they are spontaneous trips. 

I was talking to my family about this at breakfast this morning and they are all kind of appalled by me not wanting to do this. My sister pointed out that if I was still married, then I wouldn't have all the child free time I have now and many mothers don't get a break from their kids like I do. My mom said she can't believe I'd deny my children quality time with their parents for selfish reasons like not wanting to give up my weekends. My SIL seemed to understand where I was coming from but said that she would still do it and just incorporate the child into whatever I was doing and pointed out my daughter would love to go on the NYC shopping trip I had planned for December and my son would happily join me for my Saturday morning spin classes. I considered that but my SIL loves taking her kids everywhere so I don't know that she is aware of how nice it is to just be an adult without the responsibility of a child wherever you go. They were really making me feel like an asshole though. AITA?",1
"I have two younger sisters who are 15 and 17. They came to visit my husband and I on what was supposed to be a 5-week trip. Unfortunately, it had to end early after they were caught following my husband while he was having dinner with a client.

I told them they had to leave immediately because I could tell my husband was close to exploding and even though they kept begging me to hear them out and to let them stay I wouldn’t. I called our dad to let him know they would be coming home early and why which didn’t go over well. My stepmother wanted me to let them stay until the morning so they would fly back in the daytime but I told her it wasn’t possible and they had to leave immediately. 

I’m supposed to be visiting soon but my sisters have told our dad that they don’t want to see me and my stepmother said I wasn’t welcome in her house after what I did to them.

The reason my husband was so angry is because the client was the one who noticed them taking pictures of them and when he confronted them they were rude to her and to him.

"Basically I hid my girlfriend's skincare collection. I was planning on throwing it all away, until she freaked out about it. My girlfriend has had sort of an *obsessive* hobby with buying skincare since before me, and it's only gotten worse since we started dating (dating about 4 years, we're both 23 now). She picks up extra shifts on the weekend *just* to afford the newest, most interesting products. At first I was supportive of her hobby, whatever makes her happy I guess. But lately I've been struggling to understand why she buys these things. We have separate bathrooms and in every single drawer is another toner, cleanser, or exfoliant. She's in school to become a dermatologist, but seriously. I don't know anyone IN SCHOOL with this much of a collection. I've tried for months to tell her this isn't healthy and she needs help, but she tells me because she pays the bills in our apartment and for my food and ""other hobbies"", she's allowed to do whatever she wants with her extra money. But to me it's completely wasteful. She's already gorgeous with incredibly lovely, pillow-soft skin with not a single scar. She literally has the best skin everywhere on her body, it's like she's been fucking airbrushed. This doesn't matter to her though, as she is always having packages show up and new additions to her ""collection"". Here's where I think I messed up.

My girlfriend spends about 12 hours in a double shift at work, and after she left I decided to load all of her skincare in MULTIPLE black trash bags and just put them in my truck. I wasn't going to go crazy and throw them away, I know this stuff is worth 3-4 THOUSAND dollars. Some of this shit is literally in fucking boxes. I just wanted to try to show her she didn't need any of it. When she came home at around 12am exhausted and just wanted to wash her face (she ""has to"") all of her products were missing, obviously. She immediately came to me in almost hysterics about how everything is gone and she thinks we were robbed. I told her we weren't, and that she doesn't need all this stuff because she's beautiful already. I told her I took it away (didn't say where) because she doesn't need all this garbage. Within seconds her mood changed and she wouldn't even look at me. She took her blankets to the couch and slept there, crying. She was being so dramatic I decided to just get the stuff from my truck. I brought the bags in and dumped them on the floor and she started sobbing. She said some of them were gifts from her father that passed away, and she thought she would never get to see them again (he apparently wasn't good at gift giving but knew this passion of hers? Yeah.)

AITA? I literally gave her the stuff back and I don't believe her dad would just suddenly give her gifts, as she's said in the past he struggles with buying gifts. I really don't wanna lose her, I want to marry her. She's the most beautiful woman and kind soul I've ever met.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Alot of people have been calling a troll because my girlfriend's family has unusual beliefs about how men should stay at home. I don't know how to explain that's how she was raised. Also, the fact I didn't know what a studio apartment was. Jeez, sorry not knowing what apartment styles are is worthy of you all ridiculing my fucking life as a ""joke"" and ""troll"". Fuck off.

EDIT 2: I see alot of comments claiming my girlfriend has a lot of money so why does she have to work? Newsflash assholes, not everyone spends the money they have. Plus, she isn't in medical school full time (she's doing studies, she does apprenticeships but isn't in a full blown John Hopkins.)

"throwaway.

Alright, I'm keeping this short and simple.


Yesterday, I (m33) had a couple of co workers come over to work on an important project. We were way behinf schedule and needed every minute we could get to complete the project.

We lost track of time and my co workers ended up staying til 9pm. My wife was home the entire day, my co workers and I were so hungry but I couldn't leave the office so I texted my wife to ask if she could make us something to eat. well, it turned out that at 7 pm she went into the kitchen and made burger and fries for herself for dinner and did not include me or my co workers. I waited til my co workers left and asked her why she didn't make us burgers seeing how busy amd exhausted and hungry we were. her defense was that A, I didn't ask, B, I could've ordered from the restaurant if I needed. And C, she wouldn't find enough time or ingredients to make me and my co workers burgers and fries. I told her it was just 3 of us me, and other 2 coworkers so that is just an excuse. I called her a bad host but she argued that those were my guests not hers but I insisted it's her house too and she could've been a bit generous but she had this ""I don't owe anyone time or favors"" attitude the entire argument. She just threw her hands up and walked out. I think that it wouldn't have affectef her to include me and my co workers on dinner but instead made me look bad and acted sefishly. she still sees nothing wrong with what she did even after I reversed the roles. AITA?",1
"I 32M was invited to a week long family vacation by my mother 65 that would be paid for but I would have to stay the whole week in Disney World, which I am not at all interested in? Some context My mother is now living with my sister(43F) and her 3 kids ages 6f, 17m, 22f, and she takes time to visit me at least once a year, I never go visit them because I never have. My older sister and older brother 42M have the same father and growing up they mostly lived with his family and i was alone with my  mother on the opposite side of the country. 

She would go visit them several times a year but I rarely saw them besides every couple of years, beside my brother who did end up moving back in with us while I was in high school. I wouldn't say I have a bad relationship with my siblings but not much of one exists in the first place, due to the age gap and the distance. I  can think of a total of 2 times growing up that I was actually with my sisters family to visit and for those visits I spent more time with her cousins or her baby than I ever did with her. 

Honestly I would say including my cousins I don't really have a relationship with anybody in my family as I was never really around them, my mother would still visit them yearly as I was growing up but I was often left at home being watched by mother's friends who I also barely knew. I hope this gets across that I don't have any kind of relationship either positive or negative with my siblings or their family. 

My relationship with mother is not great but i don't think its strained or anything. I would like to say i was raised by a single mother but I spent most of my life taking care of myself, usually alone. Since I was 7 I have been doing my own cooking and laundry and just taking care of myself, it was honestly more frustrating when she would leave me with random people instead of letting me continue to take care of myself when she would leave to visit family. I do much better alone and do now spend most of my days alone as I find people stressful and have found out in the past few years I am autistic and that might also have something to do with it. (Mother doesn't believe me when after giving her the information and evidence on that.) 

I hope that is enough context to give an opinion on this. When she visited last summer she was telling me to use a week of my vacation for the fall of 2024 so I could go with the family vacation to Disney World, paid for I think by her partner but she always just drops names like shes introduced me to this person before. She knows I don't like amusement parks or crowded placed. I understand that this is meant to be a family vacation but I have never been invited on one before and do not see a reason to go to one now. She kept pushing the matter and I told her that if she could meet my bribe I would go (a brand new computer set up, I know it is a price she herself could afford given her job but I also knew she was not likely to meet the price.)  AITA for not going?

"Background: I (f27) lost my late husband (m33) 3 years ago. He suffered from a chronic condition and the majority of our time (11 months) was spent at hospitals, we eventually got engaged and then married in one. But he passed away 3 weeks later. So much happened in such a short time and it all just left me devastated beyond measure.


I have a good relationship with his family though they were still in contact with my late husband's ex who left him after being together for 6 years because she couldn't handle it when his condition got worse. My late husband dealt with mental health decline because of it but Clearly, my inlaws had forgiven her. They even allowed her to attend the funeral and also, gave her some of his belongings as keepsakes.


I'm friends with MIL on facebook. Earlier, I came across a post she made on her FB account congratulating my husband's ex for her newborn baby then announcing that the baby was named after him. I couldn't believe it. MIL acted as if the ex was his wife and this was his child. I called MIL to ask her about it but got no answer.

So I went to her house, brought up the post she made and told her how uncomfortable it made me. She acted like what she did was normal then went on about how my husband's ex is like a daughter to her. Again, I told her how this made me feel and asked her to take the post down - She refused, I got upset and said that she was being disrespectful of me as her son's wife and told to take it dow. she got defensive saying that my husband's ex did all she could to be there for him and that it was okay that she felt she couldn't handle the situation anymore and broke things off with him peacefully. She said that it's just a name and that I had no business even mentioning it, much less start an argument about it and dictate what she should and shouldn't post on her feed. She also said that ""yes, other people loved and cared about my husband too"" and that I should get over it.

I called her insensitive and delusional which caused her to tell me to leave her house. I returned home feeling horrible. My FIL just called to try to speak to me but I don't feel like talking since I know what he's going to say already and how he'll take his wife's side on this.


I feel enraged honestly. We were fine, we'd call and visit monthly. Now we're having this falling out and it's just horrible.


Aita for my reaction? Was I wrong for this?",1
"
My husband and I (both 40m) are raising a 13-y/o girl, to clarify. 

My daughter struggles every few months with her period. She’s fine most of the time, but some months she gets her period unexpected at school, and it’s embarrassing to her. She won’t carry pads because they have clear backpacks, and she doesn’t like wearing her own slightly bloody underwear for half a day— understandable. 

When she gets her period, she goes to the nurse with “an awful stomachache” and I am called (I work from home so it’s easier for me to get her.) Nurse always reminds me that she “could be faking” but I always pick her up and bring her home. 

Yesterday, she called again, so I walked into school to get her and the nurse was waiting in the office. Nurse asked me if I was aware that my daughter had “a pattern.” I told her yes, but that we had things figured out. 
Nurse said that if she’s really having stomach problems like this, I should take her to the doctor, because she might have anxiety. I said “thank you, but my husband and I have things figured out.”

Nurse got very cold. “I don’t think you’re taking her anxiety seriously. Fathers are supposed to want what’s best for their girls, and as a nurse I feel it’s my duty to ensure she is safe.”

This lit a fuse with me. Here’s where I could be TA: I told the nurse “I know my daughter better than you do. It is none of your business what her ‘stomach issues’ come from unless a parent tells you.” 

She then told me: “I am afraid if she is not anxious she is manipulating you into bringing her home from school. Is there a class she dreads? Does she do her homework?”

I said: “My daughter is an honor roll student and an honest girl. I’m sorry you don’t think so, but I know her and I know she’s not lying to me. Stay out of our personal business.”
She turned over my daughter without saying much else. 

Daughter will now go to the bathroom and text me instead of the nurse— we’ll just say she has “an appointment.” I feel awful, though, for being ticked— the nurse is a professional who deals with awful parents daily, and I know she was just trying to help.

"  

I have 3 kids, Raimondo (23M) Jonibella (20F) and Wren (9M). Raimondo graduated in May from college and Jonibella about a week ago from a decent community college. This was a big occasion for them so my husband and I decided to get both graduates an IPad and a $100 Visa card. (I know it isn’t much but it’s been tight since the pandemic hit, they both understand this.)

However, I really felt like Wren ought to have something too just for being such a trooper. He’s so much younger than them, getting to watch them have all these achievements that are still so far off for him, and I wanted him to know I noticed and appreciate it. So I went ahead and bought him an IPad, as well as a new Switch and a couple games since he’s younger and might not have much use for a Visa card. I did the gifts at the graduation party since I figured friends/family would like to watch. 

Everything was good until close to the end of the party when Jonibella cornered me, asking why I would “shower” Wren in new electronics when he isn’t even graduating. I told her it can be hard to grow up in a sibling’s shadow (I’d know, I have three myself), and I gave him the presents not for graduating but for being a good kid all through the graduation festivities. I told her it’s a lot to get through as a kid and I wanted Wren to know it didn’t go unnoticed. 

Jonibella said the sentiment was fine but why did I get him bigger gifts than either graduate. I said I just wanted to get presents everyone would like but I was trying to be conscious because again, pandemic really took a hit for us. She said “why don’t you just tell me you have a favorite” and stormed off. 

I don’t have a favorite or want Jonibella to think there is. She’s barely said anything to me since then and when she does it’s frosty. She says she doesn’t have anything to say to me until I apologize for “prioritizing my baby” over her. My husband thinks she should be more understanding because she hasn’t had the same experience and can’t speak from it, and I don’t want to return the gifts because Wren has been overjoyed with both and I’m so glad to see him happy. But I’m really wondering if I was out of line here just trying to please everyone.",1
"I have three children; 15,11 and 3.

My (35) partner (28) have been together 10 years.

We have 50/50 custody of the two eldest.

Nearly 4 years ago we had a rough patch and a one night stand is what led to my youngest being born, we’ve got full custody, but my wife is all she knows as her mother. All children call my wife their mum, she’s a great parent; she got the eldest into gymnastics and swimming, she does their homework with them and they’re really close - it’s nice to see. It’s hard to explain exactly how she’s a good parent? She just is.

We found out we were expecting 8 months ago, and this caused our youngest to start acting out (nursery teachers told us it was completely normal for young children to regress when big news happens). 7 months into our pregnancy we lost the baby, it upset me but it’s completely devastated my wife…she acts like everything’s normal, but she’s crying herself to sleep.

I don’t have the emotional bandwidth anymore, I’m exhausted. We just lost a child, not just her.

I’d been trying to get ready for work, while my wife got the youngest ready and I guess we were having a rough morning because I heard my youngest tell my wife “you’re not my mum, you don’t love me” obviously not exact wordings, it’s not the first time she’s told my wife this (we don’t even know how the youngest knows this)

I went to work, when I came back the eldest told us that my wife dropped youngest off at nursery and then locked herself in our room, and apparently had been crying for a few hours then left…I messaged her and got told “thanks for helping me this morning, I’m staying at my mothers. I’m not in the mood to help with your child at the moment since you don’t help me/tell her I’m her mother”

Youngest deserves to know her background, we’ve tried to explain to her step mother etc but she’s young, she’ll understand when she’s older.

I explained that I had work, she’s handled it before but I’ve been left on read. I apologised, didn’t realise she was so unhappy but said at the end of the day youngest lost her sibling too and it’s been a difficult transition, we’re looking into family counselling. I did say I’d appreciate her not having eldest witness her being this upset next time as she’s still a child.

If I’ve left any info out I’ll answer, hands are greasy and it’s hard to type! 

It was a casual morning, she usually handles getting them ready and we’ve had issues like this before that she’s handled, honestly sometimes hearing things like this has become white noise now because I know my wife can handle it when I’ve got to work.

Edit; the reason I say not to be as upset in front of my eldest is because eldest went to her biological mum and told her she was worried about her mum (my wife) which I don’t think is fair.

"
I’m stressed out wondering if I’m in the wrong here.

I, 24F, have been in my appartement since July. My building is constituted of 6 units; 3 story tall with one common door and all units separated by stairs that go up to 3rd floor. I’m in a middle unit. All of the others units (expect one) are constituted of older folks (65+) which are retired. (No kids)

Context: I live in Quebec, Canada. Cannabis is legal. I smoke cannabis. My building regulation says that smoking is banished from the building and communal areas. I thought smoking on my balcony/outside on the lawn wouln’t bother my neighbors since: I am not making excessive noise while outside and will not go out smoking when someone else is out.

End of October, my landlord rings me and lets me know that other units have been making complains because of the smell and that smoking out on the balcony/lawn is not allowed. Since then, I smoked in the street.

A month later, another call. There have been other complaints. Now my landlord is freaking out, telling me that if he gets another smell related complain, he will have to evict me from the building. I’m being inconsiderate going out smoking in the street. They sent me a formal notice that tells I need to follow their building restrictions, which I am?! I was freaked out and answered in a letter telling them that, and that I would prefer email communications from there. Did not hear back.

During Christmas time, I had 4 friends over for diner and gamenight which involved: treasure hunt, trying to open an overwrapped gift and maybe 3 songs of karaoke. We went out smoking in the street maybe 4-5 times, making sure not to make excessive noise while going in/out of the building and even while outside. Everyone left my place at 23h00. I called it a night and went to bed.

Yesterday, my landlord stops me in my parking lot while I leave for work (ED nurse, I smoke a blunt at night when coming back from my shift then go to bed!) He tells me that he wants to talk about a noise complain he received about my Christmas Party. He tells me that he’s considering evicting me because this behavior is innappropriate and should only take place in a house. I need to understand that:
- I’m not being considerate of the ‘’kind of building’’ I’m living in.
- I’m making excessive noise ALL the time which is apparently bothering at least 3 neigbors.
- Smoking cannabis outside in the street is also not allowed.

I am mad. I live alone with my cat. I never make any excessive loud noise. I mean, I listen to music on my phone at medium volume, talk at normal volume, maybe sing a little in the shower, is that excessive noise??? 

I told him he should just make a formal complaint if he wanted to evict me because I thought I was well within limits of what ‘’normal’’ noise is supposed to be and that I was following all regulations of the building.",1
"Hi, let me explain my title. My wife and I both work from home right now and we take turns dropping our 8 month old daughter off at daycare in the mornings.

Today it was my wife's day for drop off then she would return home and start working. I had a doctor's appointment so I left the house early.

My doctors appointment finished early so I decided to grab some breakfast at a local Cafe. I spent 2 euros or about 2.50 usd.

Once I got home I told my wife and she got really angry, calling me selfish asking how I could go out to eat without her and the baby.

Even though, the baby was in daycare and my wife had to be back home connected online for work. I didn't tell her she was crazy but this argument is insane to me.

She is angry that I had breakfast without her and the baby when neither of them could actually go!

Someone please tell me how I'm the AH here.",1
"I (32M) have a fiancé (32F). I work between 40-60 hours a week. I go in at 1pm and get home around 11pm. Because of that I go to bed late so I end up sleeping in until about 11am. My fiancé has two jobs she works remotely and is up daily at 8:30am. She also has a son (8M) who she has about 60% of the time, the other 40% he's with his father. My fiancé starts work at 9am until 5 or 6pm. The does chores around the house and has always been in charge of grocery shopping, cooking, and caring for our dogs. I don't help out around the house during the week. My job is very physically demanding and when I get home, I'm exhausted. Usually twice a month I'll take a full Sunday to help get chores done. I often work 6 days a week, with Sun being my only day off. 

Last night I got home and didn't see my fiancé. I assumed she was showering and got irritated because I always shower when I get home and now I'd have to wait. Dinner hadn't even been started. When I went downstairs 30 min later, my fiancé was at the stove cooking. She saw I was upset and asked so I told her I was angry that she decided to shower right as I was getting home and that dinner wasn't started before 11pm. She said she wasn't showering but was resting due to a headache (she has them often and always says they're stress related). She said I walked right by her when I passed our bedroom door. She said I always text her when I leave work and she starts dinner so it'll still be hot when I get home, that I hadn't that night and since 'd been getting out late she didn't want dinner to get cold. She figured I'd shower and dinner would be ready once I was done. I said I'd rather heat dinner up and eat at a reasonable time than have to wait until midnight. She apologized, said she was exhausted and had just needed to rest for a little bit. I blew up and said she had no reason to be tired. She works from home and sits at a computer all day and it doesn't seem like she has work to do because I'll see her scrolling on her phone. Of course some days she will have back-to-back meetings or I'll see her really focused on whatever task she is working on, but at times I'll see her doing absolutely nothing but wiggle her mouse every few minutes. And yes she does the house chores but that's part of working from home. She's here all day and has the time to do it. 

She got upset and she yelled at me that she not only keeps the house afloat, she also works two jobs, takes care of me and her son, takes care of our dogs, and does a majority of the chores so she has every right to be tired and just because her jobs aren't physical, they are mentally demanding and that takes a toll too. I snapped and and said ""yes, scrolling through your phone all day must be so mentally draining."" She got really angry, told me I'm an a-hole and hasn't spoken to me since. 

Yes she does a lot but so do I and if I can handle it then she she can too. So AITA?

EDITED TO ADD: yes this is real and no I do not feel I was in the wrong. She has plenty of time to herself. After she finishes whatever chores she does that day after work, she usually sits down and watches a show or if her son is home, she will watch a movie with him.  You are all acting like she never gets a break, but she does.

OK OK I got it. I'm the asshole. Thanks for the feedback.",1
"My(25M) girl Lydia(23F), lives with a roommate who has a boyfriend, Jeff. We gathered at their place last friday for pizza. After a while Jeff asks Lydia if she is still scared of being here alone the nights the roommate goes over to his place and I can't come. Lydia has always had trouble with being alone at night and most nights I stay on facetime with her till she falls asleep so she feels safer. The roommate laughs and says that if she hears a noise in the bathroom at least it will be a ghost and not her locked in passed out. Lydia just mouths ""explain later"" to me.

When we get to Lydia's room I ask her to explain and she tells me that this afternoon she wasn't feeling good and ended up fainting in the shower, so Jeff had to break to door to roommate get in and help her. She said that she already felt better and didn't wanted to tell me because I was going to be worried about nothing. I said that it wasn't nothing if she had fainted and that I should be aware of these things to help her. She said that now it would be just a funny story about how Jeff broke the door and roommate had to cover her with a towel so they could come to the rescue of her naked body.

That moment I saw red. I asked if Jeff had seen her naked and she said she couldn't be sure since she was unconscious but roommate said that he stood out of the bathroom until she was covered. I asked if Lydia thought it was fair to me not to know that another guy had seen her naked and she said he didn't actually saw her naked and that it shouldn't matter since he was only helping. I shouted that she just said that she was unconscious and couldn't know if he saw her. She told me to be quiet or they would hear me and I shouted that I didn't care, that a man just saw my gf body's and I had a right to be mad. Jeff and roommate come in then and explain that he never saw anything, he just broke the lock and waited outside until roommate gave him a clear. I said that I didn't believe him and roommate jumped to his defense saying she was right there making sure the situation wasn't embarrassing so they could take proper care of Lydia without her felling weird. I said that if she was a cuckold I wouldn't be. Jeff then shouted at me saying I should respect his girlfriend and mine, who had spent a whole day saying that she was fine but still looked a bit pale. He said that he only did it because he cared about Lydia, that I was an asshole who didn't deserve any type of help. Hearing him say he cared about her was it for me, I left without as much as looking at Lydia as she begged not to go.

Over the weekend Lydia had to be admitted to a hospital as she didn't felt good again and Jeff and roommate prohibited me from seeing her, saying I didn't deserve her. Obviously the whole hospital thing sucks and I wish I was there for her but I still think I was right. At this point I'm not mad at Lydia anymore, just at Jeff.

EDIT: They agreed to let me see Lydia upon her asking them to. She said it would be best for us to be away from each other for a while. She is feeling better and for what I heard she is anemic among other things but going home this week.",1
"My wife has a habit of doing number two whenever she attends a housewarming party. It’s a really strange habit but it’s not something she can control either. When nature calls she has to go.

Recently in an online group chat I disclosed this information to a group of people consisting of real-life friends but also gaming friends that we’ve never met in person. One of our friends IRL wants to throw a housewarming party since she is leasing a new apartment and I casually brought it up. I thought it was really entertaining to share her toilet habits with them. I also brought up other “interesting” toilet habits of hers I thought was funny. Everyone had a great laugh but she didn’t have any of it. She laughed it off in front of our friends but roasted me in private.

Am I the Asshole here guys? I really thought it was hilarious and my friends thought so too. But obviously she was upset and thought it wasn’t cool.

"My daughter (13F) is leaving school for the summer soon. She's been going on about getting snapchat for a couple weeks now, and I've consistently said no. Last month she tried to make a secret account behind my back which lost her her phone up until recently.

She's been getting increasingly desperate, telling me I'm runing her summer. Her friends only communicate through snapchat groups, and she's being left out of all their summer plans because she isnt in the group.

I simply told her if they werent willing to communicate in other means they weren't true friends and she can do better - she'll be in some clubs over the summer so she can make new friends. These ones obviously arent willing to adapt for her.

She hates me, obviously, and has been down in the dumps. My ex has contacted me recently and told me to lighten up, but I told her our daughter has already proven she cant be trusted by going behind my back in the first place.

No one seems to be on my side and I'm half tempted to just give in. People chastise you for allowing your teen on social media and then call you abusive when you dont allow it. You cant win.

AITA? I do know her friends mean a lot to her.",1
"So a little backstory: I currently live with my gf of 1 year and we have been spending many meals together, naturally. I have been eating a paleo diet for about 4 months now and we both tend to eat similarly in this sense, but she does not always have the same ideas that I do about food. She will sometimes eat cookies late at night, a lot of carbs, and “not paleo” things.  I’ll be clear, we both eat healthily, I just eat a stricter diet.

This morning I commented on her choice of a breakfast sandwich (bacon, eggs, ciabatta, mayonnaise) and said she should not be combining a lot of fat with a lot of carbs, also stating that it’s ok to eat one or the other, just not a lot of both. She starts crying and claims that she feels judged for her food choices and that she hadn’t had a sandwich in a long time and woke up craving one. She says I made her feel shitty and judged. 

Now Reddit, I in no way judge her or her food, all I seemed to do, imo is just bring up the nutrition aspect of her food. She is adult and is able to make her own dietary choices, I feel like I was just trying to bring up some talking points on nutrition. So with all that being said, am I the asshole? ",1
"I go to a university with two campuses in two cities in opposite sides of my country. You can switch campuses at the end of each year, and switch back and forth (campus a 1st year, campus b 2nd year, campus a 3rd year again, etc). A lot of people spend 2 years in one, and then switch to the other for their final two years.

Last year was my second year, and I had to make a choice of whether to stay in the campus I had spent two years at, or go to the other one. I had lived in both cities previously and didn’t have much of a preference, so I decided on the basis of whether this girl i had a crush on was switching or staying.

She was a 1st year when I was a 2nd year, and I didn’t really get to know her that well last year. The reason is, I faced a pretty debilitating illness, and it diminished my looks a lot 2nd year— hair loss, loss of muscle mass but weight gain, cuts on my face from surgery, etc. People always said I was good looking before, and I knew with time I’d gain them back, and as it was 2nd year I looked like shit and I approached her likely wouldn’t be successful, so I decided to just bide my time, wait for my looks to come back by 3rd year, and then approach her.

For that to happen ofc I’d need to be on the same campus as her, so I discreetly asked around where she’d be and chose the same campus.

My plan worked out perfectly— she and I stayed on the same campus, and by the time this year rolled around, my cuts had faded, my hair grew back as thick as normal, I regained muscle mass and lost the extra fat, etc. I began striking up conversations/joking around with her and she reciprocated well, etc.

The issue is, some of my friends think I’m creepy/TA for making my choice on which campus to stay at on the basis of a girl I had nothing with. I don’t see an issue with that. I made my decision with no expectation that it would work or feeling that it needed to, more so just I wanted to take the chance either way so whether it succeeds or fails I don’t regret it later. I don’t see how that’s problematic.

"Hi all! My boyfriend suggested I post here because is sister is really upset with us. 

I (19f) have been with my boyfriend, who we’ll call Seth (20m) for about 6 months. We’re planning a beach vacation this August before classes start up again. My boyfriend’s sister, Jane (34f) luckily lives in a beach town, so we thought staying with her would be a great option to cut costs. 

Back in September Jane said it’d be fine. But then Jane got pregnant and she’s due at the end of July. She recently told Seth that we need to change plans because she doesn’t want to entertain us after just having a baby. I’m really frustrated because we’ve really been looking forward to this trip. 

Seth went and talked to his dad (Jane’s step dad) about it and his dad told her to see how she feels after giving birth and go from there because it’s not right for her to go back on her word. 

Seth told her that it’s just not right and she said that until he pays her mortgage and births a baby then he can tell her what to do. She also said she would help us find an affordable Airbnb. 

I’ve thought about approaching Jane myself since I’m also a woman and maybe she can have more of an understanding coming from me how much this trip would mean to us. Seth said that Jane used to be a lot of fun and loves to go out and have drinks with friends but she’s been different even before she got pregnant. 

WIBTA if I reached out to Jane and tried to talk to her and try and get her to let us stay? 

ETA: Seth had offered for me and him to watch the baby one night while she goes out with her husband but she said no to that. She said she doesn’t really know me (we’ve met about three times and she doesn’t really try to get to know me beyond that) and she doesn’t think Seth is responsible enough to be alone with her kid. Which is really hurtful to hear. 

Update:

We read through a lot of the comments and I chose to not confront Jane because a lot of comments made sense. I am disappointed about the trip but seeing a lot of comments about what it’s like to be a new mom made me see things differently. Also I don’t want Jane to think I’m annoying. The issue now is that Seth reached out to her. 

He basically asked her again if she would at least think about it she got extremely upset and said that this decision wasn’t up for a discussion or a debate and that she was tired of their family acting like her house is a vacation house and that none of them would be welcome for a long time because of this. She also said things like she was sick of them all visiting when it’s convenient for them and not when it really works for her. 

Seth is really mad because Jane told him that he isn’t her priority and that he needs to grow up at some point. I could tell it really hurt his feelings and I’m not really sure what to do. I still don’t know a lot about Jane or her relationship with the family other than she occasionally visits and it’s very short trips maybe like once a year even tho she lives a few hours away. He’s also said when she visits that she gets annoyed easily with everyone minus a few people. 

Anyway this is my update. I don’t know if there will be anymore but I do know that the beach trip definitely won’t be happening. Thanks for your alls input. ",1
"I (43F) have a 22 (Sam) and 14 (Kathy) daughters. Our family was dirt poor as Sam was growing up. It was a bad time overall, we knew something needed to change when Sam was 8 so I went to college at night, we could only afford a few classes a semester so it took longer than 4 years. I finally graduated from when Sam was 14, but we were still poor even with the new much better job due to debt. When she was 18 it finally got a lot better, I got really lucky and ended up in a high demand field. We went from struggle for food on the table to could go on vacation twice a year without problems. 

Kathy was 10 when she we were much more stable so her and Sam’s childhoods are a lot different. Kathy can go to a nice school while Sam’s school was a shit inner city public school. I don’t have to buy from thrifts stores anymore, she has an iPhone and so on. Now I pay for Sam to go to college without any debt, and she comes on all family vacations free, pay her apartment rent and so on. 

The problem is Sam is so jealous of her sister, the school is taking people on a trip to DC and that’s were all of this came to a head. Sam yelled at her sister about how she is a spoiled brat and told me I should treat her the Same way she was growing up. That’s she should get hand me down clothes and have to go to a shit school. 

We got in a bigger argument about she believes I should be poor to her sister. I told her if she wants us to be poor so much then she can pay her own rent from now on. She called me an ass when she realized I was serious. She went to our aunts and they are on her side. AITA?

I will give her a call, see if we can work this out",1
"So basically I am a Sales Director of a Courtyard hotel in a suburb. My girlfriend is a math teacher and we talked about her potentially hosting a review class for extra money in one of the meeting spaces. 

She asked me about certain dates that happened to coincide with a major town wide  event right next to the hotel - the World Cup of cricket. She knows that this is going to be the highest revenue generating event of the year for the hotel and that I have been strategizing about the best way to approach it and have been turning down many groups as to hopefully be the last closest option and be able to charge a premium. We have 3 meeting spaces and with all the guest rooms also comes meeting spaces whether for team meals, team meetings, etc. Even if we got some sort of media staff we can’t have 100 people go over load our breakfast restaurant at once so we push big groups into a meeting space with a breakfast buffet as Courtyards do not have a buffet. I have deliberately turned away any meeting room only business over those dates as to save my space for the right group. 

When she asked me about the dates I tried explaining the situation that teams or staff or media potentially need the space and she said why does cricket need meeting space? I explained what I just wrote above about how if we need to give all these people breakfast we can’t do it in our restaurant, team meeting etc. and that my bosses are expecting banquet revenue out of this somehow as well. She kept pressing me that she just needs a yes or no and I kept trying to explain the situation in hopes that she may let me off the hook.

Eventually after a tense conversation I said no not right now I can’t risk losing 2 weeks worth of something extremely profitable because I have 2 days of your event and she wasn’t mad but there was tension. She said the way I handled it she just would have preferred a direct answer but it’s very hard to say no to your girlfriend of 7 years.  It is my job to make as much money as possible and it is not a huge conference center with 20 different spaces we only have 3.

Am I the asshole for not being direct ? Or is she in the wrong for not taking the hint and forcing me to say no to her. In my opinion  after explaining it if it was me I probably would have said ok it sounds like the space is needed for more important things to your business ove those dates",1
"My wife turned 30 this week. I’m 26M. We’ve always had a strong relationship and I love her so much.

My wife has a best friend from childhood Jimmy 28M. I didn’t know him that well but this year we’ve gotten to know each other and have gotten close. He’s my best bud and like an older brother to me in a lot of ways.

My wife goes all out for my birthday parties and I love them. She’s more of a stoic introvert so I thought it would be nice to throw her a surprise 30th birthday with just her and me and make it a special event. I wanted to make her a gift she would love. Jimmy’s an incredible artist and for the past two months I’ve been taking lessons from them. My wife was curious why I was spending so much time away from home with Jimmy but I made vague excuses because I couldn’t tell her I was making a gift for her. She’s made a couple comments but never seemed upset.

I told her a week before her birthday that I had made plans with Jimmy. I have a job with flexible hours so it’s not uncommon for me to do it.  She wasn’t upset or anything. When her birthday came, it was all I could do not to say anything. When she left for work, I put my plan in action. I decorated the place. I brought out the cake. I learned from youtube and stored it at our friend’s house. I got a dozen bouquets of flowers. I got her a few other gifts too. 

She was supposed to come home at 5:30 but she didn’t. I waited hours for her but she didn’t come home. I called Jimmy and he said he hadn’t seen her. I called her and she didn’t pick up. I checked her location and she was at a restaurant. I went to the restaurant and she was there with her friends. They were eating a birthday cake and she had presents. I never met these friends of hers before. I think they’re from her work. 

She seemed sad. She wasn’t smiling or energetic. I wanted to take her home and show her my gift so she would be happy. I came over to her and told her she had to come home. We grabbed her things and left. On the uber back, she didn’t say anything. At home she started crying. 

She has been sleeping on the couch and she avoids me. My wife hasn’t talked to Jimmy either. I told my mom and she called me an asshole. I don’t know why. AITA?",1
"My boyfriend(22M) of 5 months moved in when lockdowns started happening.

I(31)was widowed a year ago, and I feel so lucky to have found love again. 

Yesterday I come home from shopping and saw my daughter (13) crying. 

My late husband owned a pottery studio and would gift specially designed plates and cups to my daughter. 

We have been keeping those pieces in the same cabinet as the fine china.

Today she opens the dishwater and comes to see that my boyfriend and the friends he had over had used the plates and cups her dad designed for her. 

And one of the cups was particularly chipped and the rest had stains on them from the food and sauces they were eating. 

She starts screaming that she hates my boyfriend.

I confront my boyfriend and he gets very upset. 

He brings up the fact that he had caught one of my daughter’s friends drumming his guitar a couple days ago even though he had said that this was his and his alone. 

He then gets emotional and says that it’s ridiculous that I would defend someone who was clearly intruding upon his personal property.

My daughter continues yelling at him which gets her in trouble with me, as I told her to calm down, and I sent her to her room.

When I come to give her her dinner, she claims that my boyfriend also said that I was a fool for even thinking of siding with a brat who has never contributed anything to the world and has been leeching off me since she was born.

When I ask my boyfriend about it, he says that never happened and she’s lying to break us apart. I personally have never heard him say anything like that to her. 

So I go back to my daughter and ask her to apologize to my boyfriend for disrespecting his property and she refuses, calling him a bunch of disrespectful names. 

I subsequently ground her, but say that she’d be free to do as she pleases once she apologizes and is willing to start a mature discussion with myself and my boyfriend since we are a family now. 

The guitar is very important to my boyfriend, and he felt very hurt that she and her friend were practically rolling their eyes at his wishes.
I want my relationship to work, and my boyfriend is already stressed from work and is made even unhappier by my daughter’s attitude.

AITA?",1
"I was told to post this here so here I go:

So, I’m throwing a New Years party and I’m inviting nearly every friend I have. But the party will have alcohol and meat products (including pork) for snacks and my friend is Muslim, so, obviously, that’s not happening.

I was talking with him over lunch and the conversation took a weird turn. Let him be F and me be M

M: Man I need to learn how to bartend.

F: oh yeah, why?

M: oh I know [mutual friend] likes the 4.50$ cosmos on Thursday from [local bar] and she’s coming to my New Years party and I wanna make some for her.

F: you’re having a New Years party?

M: yeah

F: Do you mind if I come?

M: Well. I know you hate the holidays and there’s going to be pork and alcohol, I can’t negotiate on either of those because I already bought the pigs in the blanket and [other friend I have a crush on ] loves her 6.45$ ol fashions and I want to make her some.

After this, F was mostly silent for the rest of lunch. I thought maybe he’d be understanding and appreciative that I was looking out for him by not bringing him to a place that goes against his religion, but my friends are saying I should’ve invited him just to be polite. I said I’m not going to because I don’t want to be responsible for something like this again (a few years ago I tried to convert a friend and it ended up a shit show).

Now, I think there are four main angles to this story:

1. My friend is muslim, and there's strict rules to that. I can't be expected to make special accommodations for ONE PERSON when there's upwards of 40+ people planning on coming (I'm just one guy!)

2. It's really important for me that this party goes well. On top of it being, well, New Years, and me wanting to enjoy myself, I Have a friend who I'm planning on asking out here. I can't have to deal with personal drama and people being upset while planning the perfect new years kiss.

3. He pried into my personal life, I was content to just not tell him about the party. Well my mom always says, curiosity kills the cat, pry to far into someones life, you may find things you didn't want to know.

4. I'd be happy to have him come if it wasn't for his restrictions, I'd seriously be ELATED if he came, super happy. I'm not doing this with glee.

Well, What do you guys think:

Tl;Dr: Friend has restrictions which make it impossible for him to come, he's mad that I didn't invite him for it.

edit 1: I said 2 main angles instead of 4

Edit 2: Since there's some confusion about me trying to convert someone in the past, I answered this in another post:
""A few years ago I was having a Fourth of July party and tried to tell my Jewish friend that it didn’t make any sense why he would celebrate Fourth of July and be Jewish. I offered to convert him that day and take him to my church but he got really mad and left and I haven’t spoken To him since that all blew over.""

Edit 3: Please read my entire post, including points 2 and 4.

Edit 4: I think there may be a misunderstanding in this post, or something. I'm not sure what the disconnect is here but keep in mind that there are often more than one sides to a story.",1
"My girlfriend has an 8 year old daughter with a heart condition. I have a 7 year old daughter and 10 year old son.

My girlfriend's daughter has very specific needs that can be hard to work around. She can only be with one babysitter so if we want to go out without the kids, we have to go on the babysitter's schedule. If we do want to bring the kids we have to be at her house by 7 so her daughter can be in bed by 8. Day trips are nearly impossible because she takes a 2-3 hour nap at 12 so we either have to be driving for those 2-3 hours, we have to leave after she wakes up, or we have to get a hotel/motel/air bnb for her to take a nap (yes, we've actually done this before). Then there's all of the hospital stays to work around too. She stays in the hospital for 2 nights every 14 days. I only have 50/50 custody of my kids so it's very hard to get the kids together because of all of this. Sure we can go to build a bear, the indoor playground down the street from her house, or out for ice cream but you can only do that so many times before the kids get bored of it.

I've been trying to plan a weekend trip to an amusement park for so long but she wants to make us all work around her daughter's nap schedule. The amusement park doesn't open until 10 but we'd have to leave at 11:30 so she could go back to the hotel for her daughter to take a nap. We could go after she wakes up, so we'd probably get in at around 3:30 but the water rides close at 5 so my kids would only get to ride one, maybe 2 water rides then another couple regular rides before we'd have to go back for her daughter to go to bed.

She wants to do something that would be more accessible to her daughter (she can't go on the bigger rides or water slides and her having to take a nap would take a lot of time from the rides and games) like the beach and rent a place where we can do things in the house instead of having to go out all the time but my kids really want to do the amusement park trip. I eventually told her we're going to do the amusement park, she and her daughter are welcome to join but we won't be leaving early for naps or an early bedtime.

She says I'm dismissing her daughter's needs but I think she's refusing to take anyone else's needs into account.

Edit: My girlfriend just texted me that since I'm ""unwilling to compromise and find an accessible activity that everyone would enjoy"", she booked a last minute 7 day cruise for herself and her daughter so the kids and I can do whatever the fuck we want but she won't have any part in it. ",1
"I'm (26F) a PhD student and I have been dating Sam (29M) for the last 3 years. Early on into the relationship he told me that he's NC with his family. I’ve asked him why, but he said that it’s not something that he wants to discuss. I haven't brought it up since then, and he hasn't dropped any hints as to why.

I was at a conference this past weekend where one of the keynote speakers had Sam’s rather uncommon last name. I texted him a picture of the flyer and asked “Lmao is this your long-lost aunt or something?” He texted me back saying “No, that’s my mom.”

I talked briefly with Sam's mom during the Q and A session that followed her presentation. She was so nice and patient when answering my questions that I started to wonder why Sam was NC with her. 

After I came home from the conference, I told Sam that I talked to his mom and that she seemed really nice. He dropped his fork on the floor and completely blew up at me. He accused me of ""betraying"" him even though I told him that she had no idea who I was and that I talked to her to ask questions about her research. He also said that him being NC with his family automatically meant that I was forbidden from talking to them without his permission. I was so scared because I've NEVER seen him get angry or raise his voice at ANYTHING. I booked an Uber to a friend's place and told him that I'm staying with said friend until he gives me a genuine apology and an explanation as to why he's NC with his family.",1
"This is my throwaway account. 

My (37F) babysitter (16F) has been babysitting for me for about 2 months. She’s a very sweet and quiet girl and is good with the kids (4F and 8M), we’ve only had small problems here and there but nothing major at all. When she first started babysitting for me I had asked her if there were any drinks or snacks that she’d like me to keep at the house as she’s here from 9-7 every day Monday through Saturday. She mentioned that she really liked seltzer water and I had bought them for the first month, but honestly I forgot after a while and never kept any in the fridge. A few days ago I bought hard seltzer’s for me and my husband, and didn’t think anything of it. 
A little bit after 2 pm she messaged me that she wasn’t feeling well and thought that she may have to go home, if it was possible if I could get off from work earlier. I asked her to try and hold out until the end of the day. Not too long after she called me crying, saying that something was wrong and she had to go home. 
She was drunk clearly, she drank the hard seltzer’s. I told her to leave and she walked home. 
She messaged me the next day and said that she now knew that hard seltzer’s were alcohol, and she hadn’t know, she never drank before as both of her parents were alcoholics and she has diagnosed PTSD regarding alcohol, she never planned on drinking in general. I told her not to come back as she put my children in danger. She called me crying and saying that she didn’t know, and that she cared deeply about my children and would never ever drink with them, or at all, and that she needs the money to pay for her drivers permit (she comes from a not so well off family). I told her to find a real job and that it wasn’t my fault she got drunk. 
My husband says I’m being very rude and that she did try to reach out when she wasn’t feeling well. My kids are upset to see her go. 
So reddit, AITA?

Edit: okay guys, I’m the asshole. I see it now. Thank you. I’ll hire her again.

Edit #2: I will pay her $1500 a week from now on. And pay for her permit and test. As well as her license test.",1
"I (35) was born out of wedlock. My mother tracked my father down and dropped me at his doorstep when I was 15 and never returned.

My father rejected me so his step sister took me in and raised me. She also has a daughter, Kate (30). I was a difficult child and got pregnant at 16 but better now.

Kate got married 2 years ago. She got pregnant after. When her baby was four months, my aunt insisted she and her husband move in with us so she can help with the baby as both of them have very demanding jobs.

I also got married a year ago to my baby daddy and got pregnant.
I am my husband are struggling financially as we are both unemployed so  I asked my aunt if I can move back in with my first son so she can assist me which she agreed. I had my baby a month ago but still with my aunt because she pays for everything and first son's school fees and want my husband's finances to improve before we leave.

The problem is that Kate does not do anything at home. She works at home. From 7:30 am to 6pm. Her husband also work long hours. Kate wakes up, brings her son to my aunt and locks herself up till 1. She gets an hour break, plays with her son, eat lunch, video calls her husband and goes back to work. She only cooks dinner and only for herself, her son and her husband as she doesn't eat with us.

My aunt either makes breakfast and lunch or I cook. Then she goes to serve Kate in her home office. My aunt practically does everything for her in terms of child care and chores. Her husband pays for all the bills of the house. The house is for my aunt so no mortgage. I can cook and before I get to eat, my aunt will serve Kate first. Everything, it's Kate and her son first.

Two days ago, I saw her in the kitchen making dinner for her husband. I told her that she is a married woman and should buy her own groceries rather than use what I purchased. She told me she gives my aunt  $3000 every month which excludes money for bills her husband pays because she doesn't have time to go shopping herself. I told her aunt said that money is for taking care of her son. She told her she isn't paying her mom to take care of her son but gives her extra money if she needs it to take care of herself and the home. Perhaps before bringing her son to her mom each morning, she leaves $20 or $30 in his backpack.

She also always prepares dinner after 7pm when we have already had dinner and resting. Her husband gets home around 7:30pm. They like to cook, sit and eat together, chatting and laughing and I have even cought them making out in the kitchen after 8pm. My aunt goes to bed at 6:30pm.

I complained to my aunt and told her that Kate's son is now 1 year old so when are they leaving but she said Kate is pregnant again and she would like them to stay for as long as she can get them to. I feel I do all the work and Kate does nothing yet eats and snack freely and make noice when we are supposed to be resting.

AITA for asking for Kate to leave?",1
"It’s a long story but will make it short as I can me (F19), fell into deep depression by the end of 2022 when I was meant to be In my first year of uni. I lied to my parents who don’t have much idea of how uni works in this country that I will start at XYZ date but didn’t. To be honest my crippling anxiety thought the uni would let me in when I was ready so some point in the end of 2023 I believed I’d be in my first year. I reached out to mental health services around this point (first 6 months of 2023) but it’s the NHS so I was on a 6 month waiting list.

My mum around this point kept pushing that I should go with one of my old friends. But I feel like I am and was such a different person, going with them felt like I was flogging a dead horse because I was eager to start alone and find my people finally but I had so much anxiety. I did reach out to old friends and they did reply but I ignored them again because I now found out I was using their attempts to contact me as a safety blanket and possibly to make me feel better. My mum just wanted me to go to university and she regularly expressed that she said she wanted me to be confident and finally make friends I wanted. She was ready to take me any place I wanted to like the city. And I spent a lot of her money seamlessly but the selfish self soothing went on. 

This one time we were chilling at home and she bought up someone going out with their friends (I asked hoping she’d say work or shipping to make me feel better), I got instantly angry and sensitised. She said everyone has friends and some people don’t. On another occasion I asked her to lie to someone looking at our house that I went out to meet friends but she said it would seem pointless to lie about that what if she asks me to call your friends? Then what, I got offended by that also. 

I basically expected her to not mention the world friends which is unrealistic looking back. Now I feel like I missed out on making friends and socialising like other people my age I feel old. Right now I resent her and tell her she’s the reason I’m on a second gap year. I didn’t mind my first as I needed it for my mental health. I told her it was realistically my last chance to make friends and she messed it up for me by worsening my anxiety. As for my progress I started therapy 4 months ago and can leave the house on my own as I couldn’t before that. Whenever my mum mentions university now I instantly snap back at her saying if you didn’t make me feel like shit maybe I would’ve been at uni months ago by now.",1
"I a 20(m) am dating my (19) F  and as the title says we were having a discussion about religion she is muslim and I am christian. we never really got onto the topic of religion before least not in debating terms. The topic we got on was if the holy texts are actually truthful and from the word of God. She made some good arguments about God not being in the physical world so therefore the bible or Quran don't have the word of God, and how people have changed the translation.

her belief also as she told me is she is a more faithful person and doesn't do all the rules of islam.

I, being christian wanted another opinion because I don't have all the knowledge and wanted to provide the best answer, so I reached out to my friends who are more knowledgeable on these type of topics just to make sure I wasn't messing things up.

I then tell her "" this is what my friend told me"" and then she stops me mid sentence and says ""goodnight, I don't want to talk anymore"" and hangs up. This has happened before when we were discussing another not so important issue about weeks and months because we were saying different answers and I asked friend, she was very adamant about not asking for another opinion. This time tho she got very mad and said a lot of mean things about my religion over text and how I'm always running to my friends and I don't have opinions of my own, nor do I respect her boundaries by not getting other people involved in our business, and that if I have questions I should ask someone who's studied the scripture .

I totally agree with keeping people out of our business but to me this wasn't something that needed to be just the two of us, get more views on the subject is my logic as in my eyes this was not a opinion based question and I wanted to say the right thing. Mind you when I asked my friends I never mention her name or anything relevant to us as a couple other than ""what's your thoughts on the bible being miss translated""

I tried explaining to her this was not a attack to her or me being disrespectful and stepping over her boundaries I was simply trying to answer her argument the best I can.

so, AITA for asking my friends for biblical answers amid a debate with my gf?",1
"My ex and I are split up.  Our older son lives with him and younger with me.  We are both not high income but he somehow landed a wife who makes 4x our income and they often go out of the country on nice vacations which I guess he has been sharing with the kids.

The kids want their passports now thanks to his brainwashing. I initially said yes because him and my son caught me off guard and started asking me if it was okay one day.  Then I had time to think about it and realized how bad things are in the world right now and I don’t feel like it’s worth the risk and danger having the kids so far away from me and out of the country with their dad and stepmom.  They also need my consent per our custody agreement to go out of the country anyway, and at this point I’d never say yes.

So today when my ex asked me if X date was okay for the passport appointment I asked where he is even going to be taking the kids, to which he told me “he didn’t know yet, they just want to get the ball rolling because it takes 3 months just to get the passport and they haven’t planned anything specific yet” which I find sketchy.

So I told him and the kids no, that he needs my consent to take them anywhere because of how bad the world is right now and I’d never agree so passports are pointless.  My younger son got upset and my ex got angry also and kept repeating “are you just never going to allow them to go anywhere then?” I never said that, just not right now.

So my ex is texting me now saying I’m an asshole and I’m “robbing my kids of experiences” except I never have gone out of the country and don’t have a passport and I am fine, so I don’t really buy it.  Like does a 7 year old and a 14 year old really need to experience japan or england or whatever, they can go when they are 18 and probably appreciate it more then. Other than some initial disappointment my kids haven’t even mentioned it to me again so I have a feeling they don’t really care and it’s more their dad influencing them.

So AITA?",1
"I'm pretty much a practical nudist, meaning that I love to wear as few clothes as practical. Naturally in social settings I try to be more careful. My bf and his roommate have a pretty sweet apartment downtown so we spend most of the time there. He's a really nice and chill guy and on days my bf and I don't wanna get intimate, we just hang out in the living room drinking, smoking, and watching movies.

Sometimes I end up just hanging out in a towel after a shower. I explicitly checked with the roommate that this was ok and he didn't mind. 

Unfortunately now, he has a new jealous girlfriend who DOESN'T hang out with us sometimes but she still feels like she needs to police what I'm wearing in the apartment of my boyfriend. We got into a bit of a stupid text message exchange when she found out and she's clearly jealous and insecure. It doesn't help her self-esteem I guess that nine times out of 10 people are gonna say I'm the hotter person (beauty is in the eye of the beholder and all that).

I'm not self-centered, it's purely a comfort thing. It's not remotely sexual for me, so I think I'm in the right holding my stance. AITA here?

edit: I would cover up if she was around, for sure. I don't intend to make any one uncomfortable, that was said in the beginning.",1
"Me (17M) and my brother Max (19M)have always been very good academically. At home, our fridge is full of all our report cards and various achievements. 

My sister Fer (14F) on the other hand, not so much.  It's quite hard to find anything that has Fer's name on the fridge, not because she's the least favourite or isn't loved by my parents, but because she doesn't have any.

In hopes of helping my sister with her academics, my mom made me and Max tutor Fer with one of the subjects she was finding difficult. Max does Maths, while I do English (and my dad does science). 

I've enjoyed tutoring Fer, but it seems as if the feeling is not mutual. 

Example: Last Friday as I was tutoring Fer, she asked if she could ""quickly"" go to the toilet. I said yes. 

10 minutes late she had still not returned, when I went to check on her I found her in the living room watching TV. 


Yesterday afternoon Fer came to me and asked if I would please tutor her for her upcoming English test. I agreed but only if she promised to pay attention this time. 

Fer promised she would and for a while, she stayed true to that, I was helping through something she found extremely challenging and she was working with me until Max came home with McDonald's (our parents are crazy health nuts so fast food is a rarity in our home). 

Fer looked ready to put everything down just to eat and started claiming that all the studying was making her hungry. 

I told Max that we were busy and he should just leave the food in the oven and we'd heat it later. At this Fer started to whine, saying that I was being unfair by not allowing her a break.

 Max decided to side with her, even though he knows how much she needs this tutoring and started saying that I was being too strict. 

Fer beamed at that and was ready to go downstairs to eat. 

Something in me snapped, after all these times of trying to get Fer's attention failed, the one time it was needed she was going to leave it to eat McDonald's. 

I told her to not go and she didn't listen, this angered me very much, she was still not listening to me, 

I raised my voice ( Max says I yelled) and told her ""Fer, this is the reason why you're behind all your classes! You're in all these extra classes like the piece of shit you are for a reason. Why won't you listen, you idiot"". 

She immediately began crying loud ugly sobs.  
after I had ""yelled"" at her while Max gave her hug.   

When my parents came home, they were more annoyed that I had called my sister ""an idiot"" than the fact that she would not listen to me when I was repeatedly trying to get her to do some work. 

When I asked Max why he decided to side with Fer he said that ""there was no point anyway because it was inevitable that she was going to fail"".  

Fer won't even look me in the eyes, but she's been all over Max for helping her that afternoon. 

Feel like everyone forgets that she's 14, not 4 because she's the youngest.

AITA for wanting my sister to do some work?",1
"For context, this is a person who has been one of my best friend since before high school.

I (29m) was having a conversation with my best friend (27M) about a month ago and he was telling me about a girl he was talking to. He said they hadn’t been talking long but knew each other for a little bit. He sends me a picture of her to which I reply, “she looks like an uglier version of Emily.” 

I don’t know the girl at all. I wasn’t saying she was a bad person or that she was so ugly idk why he’s talking to her, but I could tell I crossed a line with him. We argued for a while but I apologized and thought that was the end of it.

Fast forward to now and he brings it up again. I don’t know why he still feels some type of way about this considering they only went on one date and don’t even talk anymore outside of a friendship relationship. I had already apologized for what I said but I told him I don’t apologize for how I feel. If I don’t find someone attractive, then that’s my preference. How I feel about the looks of someone shouldn’t dictate how he feels about her.

I told him again “I’m sorry but you asked me what I thought of her and I gave you an honest opinion.” 

We argue for a little bit after that and he still wouldn’t drop it, so I left. He then text me telling me not to talk to him till I apologize, even though as of now, I have apologized twice. At this point, I am mad. Not only because he wouldn’t drop it, but because he felt so disrespected still behind a girl he isn’t even talking to anymore. Also because another friend of ours has constantly been disrespectful to him about other things and he has let it slide.

We have been best friends for years. This is a girl he went on one date with and he is willing to throw away our entire friendship because of that comment. 

Now we aren’t friends anymore because he says I’m blatantly disrespectful to him even though I’ve apologized. 

So I need to know, AITA here?


EDIT: for people saying that I was probably saying a lot of other stuff that was disrespectful, that’s not the case. We talk on the phone every day and he has told me that I was the friend he could talk to anything about. I realized the line I overstepped and apologized sincerely when it was said.",1
"Am I the asshole? My (40m) 3 months pregnant wife (36f) goes on an annual trip with her girls. I’m ok with that. About 3 months ago she asked me if it was ok if she went to Cancun with her girls for 4 days. They have little to no international travel experience and she has zero situational awareness. When traveling before she has requested Uber rides to places that the driver wouldn’t even stop at to try a restaurant. 

I told her I didn’t want her going to Mexico because I didn’t trust she would just stay at the resort and to go anywhere in the US. She has had a miscarriage before and I worried that any complications outside the country could be disastrous. That was the end of the conversation. 

2 weeks ago she informed me that she was going to Cancun and it has been booked. She left this morning. I have been beyond pissed off about it. I believe it is reckless and unnecessary. 

This is the 2nd trip I have said no to. The first was in July of 2020 when she was also 3 months pregnant and covid was in full swing. 

She called me controlling and an asshole before she left. 

Is she right?",1
"My(24f)  husband (36m) has stage 4 colon cancer q nd we were going to a pet scan today, he had explained to me that he was tired and didn't want to converse and didn't have a lot of energy for anything. on the drive to his appointment I had made a comment on the drive about not wanting to be close to a car that was dented and scuffed but an inherently nice model. when I acknowledge and pointed out these things, he said "" That's how racism works."" I was admittedly off put because it seemed like  what he was making  a correlation between what I was doing and racism. so I then begin to discuss intent and he just kept agreeing and saying that's also what racism is which anchored me more because it felt like he was just reinforcing the correlation what I hadn't brought up race.  It then turn into a fight qnd while I technically did back up his fact one tbe similarities, i didnt understand why he felt like had to bring it up. I pointed out to him that by him bringing a brace it inherently drew a line between me and my actions and what racists do. he denied it over and over and said that I had made the correlation, not him. due to me getting loud. he also got loud and proceeded to yell that he had never made the correlation but I had bought it up in the first place. I didn't bring a race so I didn't understand the correlation and he's blaming me for the dissolution of the whole morning. was I wrong? I really need some perspective because he thinks that it's my fault. I took his words the wrong way and that it's my fault that I'm choosing to be mad or her on his words and that I am the one who needs to apologize. AITA?

***Update & more info ***

everyone is right in the fact that he is facing his immortality and it should give him more. grace. that sander that conversation, I took the comment at face value and it made me really uncomfortable because he has never been inclined to start those conversations without some prompting. I should have just kept my mouth shut and taken him to his pet scan and just let bygones be bygones. we've been in this battle for almost eight months and has been hard on both of us on both sides. I have apologize and express that I didn't understand where he wanted conversation to go and the fact that my comment wasn't meant to start one. I was just pointing out things. I have already conceded that inherently he is right on what racism is and how it's conducted. that was never my argument, my argument was the fact that it had to be brought up at all in the first place. for your comments",1
"Throwaway because her brother knows my reddit. 

Hi, my (34M) gf (21F) of two years is native American and she had this small, beaten up leather pouch. It was about the size of a golf ball, and it was beaded but there were beads missing and thread exposed and the leather was stained and greasy with something. It was supposed to look like a turtle or a lizard or something, but it was so beaten that I was hard to tell. The thing absolutely stunk. We had it in a box of keepsakes along with our photos and other things, and it made the box have a musty smell. 

Imagine my horror when I asked her what the thing was, and she told me it was her umbilical cord?? It grossed me out and I thought she was joking, so I laughed. She looked upset, so I asked if she was serious. She was. I asked her why she had it, and she told me it was her people's cultural practice to stop you from searching for things or something among other things. I thought the sentiment was nice, but it stunk and was hideous. 

I understand that some people keep teeth and that sort of thing, but teeth don't stink. And teeth aren't kept in a strange little pouch. The whole thing skeezed me out, so I put it back and left it alone.

But two weeks ago when she was sleeping, I was going through our things and wanted to scan an old photo. I opened our keepsake box and the wave of musty air hit me. I couldn't take it anymore, so I hid the thing in a box in the basement. We went through our photos and things together (it was a lovely night, we did it over wine) and she didn't even acknowledge that it was missing. I even asked her if she noticed anything gone from our stuff. She said she didn't, and laughed. 

So yesterday, I decided to rid us of it and put it in the trash. It went, and I could breathe a sigh of relief knowing my girlfriend's actual entire mummified umbilical cord was where it should've been to begin with.

But today her mom called, and told her that she was willing to remake the pouch for her if she sent it. Oops... She proceeded to tear apart our room looking for it, sobbing hysterically and not listening to any kind of reason... I'll admit, I felt bad. Maybe I should've just left it alone, but why even keep such a thing? I came clean and told her that I threw it away because I thought she wouldn't notice. 

She started screaming at me and said that it wasn't my right to throw her things away. I reminded her of when she threw my favorite shirt away just because it had a hole and a grease stain. She told me it wasn't the same thing, but isn't it? They were both items kept purely out of sentimentality. At least my shirt wasn't making our photos smell musty. 

She was suddenly calm, and I thought she was willing to talk about it, but she started packing her stuff. I begged her to stay but she took her car and her stuff and left. I don't know where she went, or if she'll be back, but I'm so devastated. It was such a small and dumb thing to split us up over, but I do regret it. Am I the asshole?

ETA Stop bringing our ages into this, she was and is an adult and you have no right to judge us. Focus on what I'm talking about here and now. I didn't want to put it in a different container because at the end of the day, we still would've had a body part that should've been tossed to begin with. Just because something is cultural doesn't mean that justifies it. Would it be okay if I kept all my fecal matter in a little bag because I thought it was special? It doesn't and didn't make sense. I feel like she was overreacting and I think everyone calling me the asshole should have to smell the damn thing. Then you'd know why I tossed it.

ETA2 All these comments are making me feel like complete shit. The last time we fought, she came back after an hour. She isn't back yet, and it's starting to take a toll. She's the one that makes dinner, cleans, comforts me. She's always there for me. The notion that I might spend tonight alone is destroying me. She's always been perfect to me, and I do things like this that upset her. Maybe I AM the asshole.... I'm sorry guys. I've been calling her and calling her and she won't answer. I just want to apologize and get her back. I want her to know how much she means to me. I think I might call her mom and tell her what I did and see if she can make another one... I know it won't be the same and it won't have her umbilical cord anymore, but maybe it'll be a start?

ETA3 I couldn't get ahold of her mom, but I have been on the phone with the sanitation department for our city, and they put me on hold for 45 minutes looking through the trash from our neighborhood. I barely caught them, and it took a lot of pleading and convincing but they were kind. They managed to find the pouch, and I'll have to pay a huge recovery fee, but that's all worth it. They agreed to let me pick it up tomorrow. If I can get ahold of my gf, hopefully she'll come back to me and things can be alright. I'll never touch her stuff again if it means she'll stay with me. I'll update this when I can get ahold of her.

ETA4 This will be the last update... I'm so devastated. I got the pouch back from the sanitation center today as soon as they called me at 8am this morning. It was a little smashed up but it's ok. If our city wasn't as small as it is, I might not have been able to get it back. I paid them and left. I left a voicemail for my gf telling her I got it back, and she finally called me back. She told me she was coming back and I felt butterflies again like when I first met her. I was waiting for her to show up, and I wanted to fully check the condition of the pouch, so I opened it and discovered what was causing it to smell-there was a cigarette butt in it beside her umbilical cord that looked like it might have been wet at some point. It made the pouch smell like ash, along with the leather stinking from whatever greasy substance was on it. The pouch was okay, so I waited for my gf to come.

Well she came this evening and asked for it immediately. I asked if she wanted to have dinner with me and she said no. I was hurt, she said she was coming back? She told me no, she just wants her pouch. I didn't want to be an asshole again, so I just gave it to her. I told her I loved her and she slammed my own door in my face. I began to mourn our relationship but she came back in and grabbed me by my shirt and asked why I opened it. I told her I wanted to see if it was ok. 

She said I didn't need to open it, and asked if I took the cigarette out. I told her I just touched it to look at it and she began to cry... She told me she was keeping that since her father committed suicide because it was the last thing he touched. She grabbed me again and I thought she was going to hit me, but she just went to our room presumably to see if she got all her stuff. Then she told me not to contact her again or she'd send her brothers to me.... I won't be an asshole and get the police involved, but that was definitely a threat. 

I'm so heartbroken...  I've lost my whole life. For two whole years, she was everything to me. I helped her get off her reservation, I paid for her GED. I did so much for her but none of it matters now. I put so much time into our relationship and into her, I was in it for the long haul. I know I messed up. I know I'm an asshole. I know I'll be alone forever. Thank you all for making me see that.

I went to our room, and she threw what looks like porcupine quills or something everywhere. She stabbed them into my side of the bed, put them in my shoes, in my dresser drawers. It seems spiteful to leave something so difficult to pick out of carpeting and bedding. They're all I have of her now though. I'm going to keep them. I hope she's better off without me. Lesson learned I guess.",1
"I (28) and my husband- “h” (29) have been married for 6 years and together for 7. H has a traumatic brain injury from when he was a kid. He can have a short fuse and doesn’t think through things when he speaks he just blurts. He has a hard time staying at jobs, his longest was 2 years but most are less. He currently works 4 or 5 - 4 hour shifts a week. We also have a 2.5 year old kid. H and I dated in high school and I got pregnant obviously my parents weren’t to happy. When we got back together as adults my parents weren’t thrilled and were not very welcoming towards him. Their biggest issues with him are his work history ( he may not stay at a job very long or full time but he always has a job) and they also don’t like that he tries to sit quietly around my family because he is trying his best not to say anything inappropriate or offensive. So now 7 years down the road h and family don’t like each other. My question is AITA for making h come to family events when he doesn’t want to go and my family would rather he not be there? My family has never excluded him but they aren’t excited he is there. This is also where kid comes into play, I don’t want kid to grow up and not have dad at family events. Does this make me the asshole for making h go to family events?",1
"Me and my girlfriend of 1 1/2 were watching the movie Fatal Attraction. It was the first time I had ever seen the movie and my girlfriend has seen it tons of times.

If y’all haven’t seen it, it’s about a guy who cheats on his wife and the mistress develops a “fatal attraction” to him. She then boils his rabbit and tries to kill his wife before they then kill her.

So once we got to the point in the movie that it was obvious to the audience that the lady is nuts, I said, “Look at how crazy she is, the sex must’ve been bomb”. My girlfriend didn’t seem to get the joke and asked why I said that. I explained to her that a lot of guys say that crazy girls are amazing in bed. She got upset and said that the joke is gross and dehumanizes women to call them “crazy”. I said that it was just a joke and that I didn’t mean anything by it.

She then asked me if I thought it was true. I told her that it didn’t matter because I was just joking. She then said that my non answer pretty much confirmed that I think it’s true, (which to be fair to her, was correct) and she asked how many “crazy” girls I had been with before her. I told her that I wasn’t going to answer the question and just wanted to watch the movie. She said she didn’t want to watch the rest of the movie because I decided to be gross and talk about how amazing other women are in bed. 

I don’t think I did anything too bad.

"For context, me/my spouse and my side of the family live 3K miles away. 

1. My spouse did not travel 3K miles to attend a 3-hr baby shower on a Sunday for my sister. I was deployed at the time, and in the process of moving back home with her family she forgot to RSVP. When she responded, my Mom told her she “would be lying if she wasn’t disappointed.” She’s still not over it.

2. While deployed, I encouraged my spouse to have fun and not worry about me. My wife has her own career. What she wants to do with her money and her weekend is up to her. My Mom felt her posting pictures on social media with her friends was incredibly disrespectful to me and my service while deployed (it’s not), stopped talking to her because of it while I was gone, and still isn’t over it.

3. I didn’t have a functional phone immediately upon returning from a deployment so I asked my wife to send a text to my family saying I arrived safely and would talk to them the following day so I could spend the evening alone with my spouse. My Mom sent my wife a text back saying “congratulations…you won. It’s not all about you”. I suppose my Mom thought it was a malicious attempt on behalf of my wife to keep me from contacting them (?). If anything, that’s on me I’m not sure why my Mom directed her anger at my spouse.

4. My wife is a germaphobe. It’s not easy, but she meets me halfway on this. My Mom believes this is a personality deficit I guess vs. an actual disorder and took offense at the answer when she asked my wife why she wasn’t eating a cookie from a communal tray in our own home while they were visiting.

5. My mom accused my spouse of being jealous of my sister for not liking/commenting on the FB posts of her child enough, believes she’s waging a war to keep me from seeing my family, and accuses me of doing nice things for my wife just so she doesn’t leave me (...incredibly offensive). Additionally, my mom has thinks my spouse had nothing before she met me, has everything now, and is ungrateful for it.

6. For reasons including but not limited to the above, my wife probably won’t join us on a family vacations this year. I don’t necessarily agree with her decision, but I understand why she feels that way and the bottom line is she’s an adult who can make her own vacation decisions. My Mom told me that I needed to do something about it. I don’t plan to. 

Bottom line is I told my Mom that my relationship with my spouse is none of her business, to keep her unsolicited advice to herself, and to stop saying negative things directly to my spouse.

I know deep down my Mom just wants the best for me, but she bottles up her emotions and creates fantasy scenarios end up exploding in an unhealthy way. It’s having a toxic effect on our family. At the end of the day I’m 100% content in my marriage. So I told her to stay out of it. Haven’t talked to her since (~ a week). AITA?",1
"
My (28F) husband (30M) is a very picky eater. He doesn’t eat seafood at all. We make it work when going to restaurants and trips by ordering one dish each and I have long ago stopped encouraging him to try new dishes. 

It has been one of my dreams to go to Japan and eat as many dishes as I can. My mom, dad and younger sister are going and have extended an invite to me. They know about my husband’s eating habits and said they would be polite enough to extend him an invite as well but wanted me to sort this out with him. 

Now, as hard as it may seem, as my partner I would be ecstatic if he partakes in the same activities as we do in Japan, but we all know he wouldn’t be able to order a decent dish at a regular sushi place in Japan. Plus his aversion to seafood kills any reason to eat out. It would severely limit our own enjoyment as well if he joined us. 

I don’t want to be one of those AH partners who don’t invite their SO with them. But it’s difficult to navigate this situation. Should I just say no to my parents as well? 

My parents and I, absolutely do not want to compromise on our meals. However, I also don’t want him to get like a meal from 7/11 only to stare at an empty plate at an upscale place as we eat ourselves. The point is, a large part of this trip will exclude him in terms of food. 

WIBTA if I tried to talk him out of the trip?


ETA: Vegetarian/Chicken options aren’t exactly going to solve this problem. My partners tastes are very very narrow. He would order the same style of pasta dish or grilled chicken no matter what place we go to

ETA 2: I think people are underestimating how much of a picky eater he is. He once disliked a chicken sandwich I ordered from an upscale place as a surprise dinner date meal because the patty was a fillet and not ground chicken (like McD) and it apparently had cheddar cheese instead of American cheese. 

When I tell you he only eats chicken and lamb, his what I am really telling you that his tastes are very very narrow. He would happily eat Indian dishes, Indo-Chinese, and even a few Italian dishes. But he wouldn’t eat Chicken Thai Curry or even Authentic Ramen Dish with chicken. 

So there’s a GOOD chance he wouldn’t be able to enjoy any Japanese dish - even if it is chicken based.    


EDIT: I have absolutely no idea why people think I assume that Japanese cuisine only consists of sushi and seafood. Why is everyone finding reasons to be upset about and feeling personally attacked? I live in a landlocked state in my country and we get no seafood here so yea from my POV Japan is a place where there’s relatively more seafood in dishes. Isn’t that obvious? 😂

It’s like when someone says that Pasta is an Italian dish and imagine all Italians are offended why that person didn’t mention the hundreds of other dishes they have. Chill 


FINAL EDIT: I am planning on talking to him and sharing the itinerary that my parents and I decided. He’s welcome to join, but we won’t compromise on changing places. Of course, he has the option to meet us back later after meal times, and I still think it’s a silly idea as having meals is going to be a decent part of trip and spending time together as a family so not sure why people here think that’s a good idea, but I am still willing to give it a shot and see how he feels about it. 

Also, I don’t get why people are even suggesting he eats Indian, Chinese or Italian food on a trip to Japan or even McDonald’s for God’s sake… what would be the point in eating fast food or a non-speciality on such a trip? Please hear yourselves first. 

People seem to think I don’t want my husband to join and want to ditch him. Maybe wonder there might be valid reasons behind my opinion? Would you invite someone to go scuba diving with you if they legitimately don’t even know how to swim? 

I don’t get the hostility, I am perfectly capable of acknowledging it was wrong to intend talking him out of it. And no, my parents don’t hate him, he’s a lovely son to them but were concerned about how it would impact us all. He’s more flexible than me when it comes to temper so no I am not trying to paint him in a bad light. 

A redditor suggested why extend a polite invite to him when you don’t want them to join you? Isn’t it obvious if they didn’t, you guys would still call them an AH? Now that they did, you are still calling them an AH and calling me an elitist. You ASSUME just because I live in a landlocked state in India, I can still manage to get seafood here. Still wondering who’s an elitist for assuming everyone has options like they do in America? 


TLDR: Stop being so dramatic. ",1
"I (F 58) will always be a mother to my twin sons, “Thomas” and “Sam.” In the summer after they graduated, when they were 18, Thomas passed away. I can’t begin to explain how broken I was. 

At that point, Sam had already accepted an offer to go to an Ivy League school. My husband and I had about 100k each saved up for the boys, but Sam’s school was so expensive that the money wouldn’t cover it. Before Thomas passed, Sam was fine with taking out student loans to cover the rest.

Then we lost Thomas. Less than two months after it happened, Sam asked if he could have the 100k that was set aside for Thomas. I lost it on him. I told him that it was Thomas’s money and not his, and it deserved to go to Thomas. This is where I might have been the AH, because Sam could have used that money. But he didn’t get a cent of it. 

To be fair, my husband and I didn’t get a cent of it either. We donated it all to various charities against drunk driving in memory of Thomas. 

That was all about 10 years ago. Sam took out student loans, but he’s so young and already a very successful lawyer. I believe he’s paid most of the loans off by now (possibly all?). If it matters at all, my husband and I contributed a significant amount (about 50k) to his law school tuition as well. 

I thought we were past it, but the other day, Sam brought up how unfair it was for me to refuse to give him Thomas’s money. We had a tearful argument over it, and now I just don’t know what to think. If I could do it again, I still don’t think I would give that money to Sam. Does that make me an AH?

Edit: because some people are confused about the way I worded things, here’s a better explanation of the money. We had 2 separate college accounts for the boys. Each account had 100k in it. After Thomas passed, Sam still got the 100k he always knew he’d get. He just didn’t get the additional 100k from Thomas’s account. We never took money away from Sam. We just didn’t give him any extra money that he wouldn’t have had if Thomas had been alive.",1
"(Throwaway because some of my family use Reddit.)

Hi, all. I (F30) have been dealing with chronic medical issues all my life. I married my (33) husband, L, a few years ago and had my daughter A (5) soon after.

When I was pregnant with A, I was warned that it would be difficult due to my issues and that she would likely have some passed on from me. I accepted this, and I expected it. She was delivered and was a beautiful baby girl who didn't have my issues at the time.

However, as she got older, it became more apparent that she inherited my medical problems. One of which has an optional surgery that could negate it entirely. It's possible to live with it instead of choosing to operate, but the surgery will eliminate it.

I have some trauma with hospitals in general. I've had to be in and out of them my entire life, and it's left some deep wounds. It's awful to spend your formative years stuck in a sterile room with an IV and in pain. I've spent some time in therapy for it, but I still hate them.

The surgery that would remove the problem is covered by insurance, so money isn't a problem. However, it has a long recovery period, and I don't want my daughter to have to suffer through that.

I've told L that I don't want her to have to go through the lengthy process of recovery. He disagrees and has asked my family members to ""knock some sense"" into me. (His words, not mine.) It's become a big point of contention between us, and I refuse to budge.

So, AITA?

Edit: For those who want to know, she has radioulnar synostosis in both arms. She'd have to spend weeks in casts with both arms.

Edit 2: You are right. I was letting my own fear cloud my judgement. Thank you. Although, a bit rude to say that I should get sterilized, no?

Edit 3: While I understand that I was undoubtedly TA here, it's disgusting how many people have written horrible comments, sent messages, and just been total jerks. You do not know me. I don't know you. This is ONE moment in my and your life, and I sincerely don't understand why you have to be so nasty about it.

No, I will not sterilize myself. I will not kill myself, give up my child, or divorce my husband. I will not categorize myself as an abusive narcissistic sadist who hates my child and wants her to suffer like I have. I don't appreciate being psychoanalyzed by armchair psychiatrist Redditors. 

To those who have respectfully put down their points, sent me kind messages, or just been supportive. I appreciate you all.",1
"I’m going to refer to my wife as Sara in this post.

Sara has mild emotional trauma because of her dad's anger issues.

I’ll refer to her dad as Bob.

Bob’s anger events have happened enough times that when Bob loses his temper around Sara for any reason, it is a struggle for Sara. Bobs anger events generally affect the people around him, but Sara internalizes these events and generally dissociates mentally as a coping mechanism during the event. Bob rarely apologizes for these anger events and Sara frequently has to take the brunt of it. Bob’s family generally has to ""walk on eggshells"" when around Bob and the mentality is generally to give him what he wants and it's easier on everyone.

Sara was also put in a series of bad situations because of bad parenting on Bob’s part. Sara’s mom passed a year or so prior to Sara turning 18. When she turned 18, she was pressured to move out of Bob’s house when she couldn't afford it. The reason Sara was pressured is because Bob chose to move into another living arrangement that couldn’t accommodate Sara. Sara had an unstable young adulthood because of this.

This isn't to say that Bob doesn't have positive attributes. He frequently pays for meals when we go out, helps his kids financially in adulthood and tries to enable family gatherings. Years after Sara left her dads house at 18, Bob began helping Sara with living arrangements and currently helps her financially when she needs it. 

Within the last year or so Bob has made a noticeable effort to be more empathetic. Almost like he has gone to therapy for his emotional problems.

Bob and I are basically polar opposites based on our beliefs and values and I don't hold it against him. It's not the anger problem I hold against him. What I do hold against Bob are his decisions in the past. The fact that he chose to have such little empathy for such a long time and that Sara has dealt with emotional trauma from his anger, most of the time not receiving an apology, that's what I can't get past.

I've never told Bob that I think of him as a bad father. He would almost certainly gaslight me if I did. 

I sometimes express how I feel about Bob and this bothers Sara. She loves her father and forgives him and feels that he is a different person now. But it sometimes becomes a point of conflict when I mention that I don’t think Bob deserves full forgiveness. AITAH for harboring these feelings toward Bob?

"To be honest, I (F) have never gotten along with my youngest DIL, “Mary” (28F). On our first meeting, she showed up in a tank top, shorts, and then spent the entire time making fun of the crosses in my house and trying to argue with me about my faith. I honestly thought she made such a bad impression, that my son, “Jack” (29M) would break up with her without me saying anything at all. This, unfortunately, was not the case. Ever since, things have only gone down hill. Until, once when I let them stay while on vacation (I live in a fantastic area), I had a group of friends over. They were making some noise, so I told my friends to “ignore them it's not important” which set Mary off. We ended up in a massive screaming match, where I was called a ""controlling narcissist"", a ""dismissive bitch"", and told that I would never see my grandkids again. I said I wouldn't be insulted, blackmailed, and embarrassed in my own house. Now we don't talk at all.

In contrast, I get along with my older DIL, “Lily” (35F) pretty well. We’ve had disagreements, but she doesn’t yell, mock me, and shows a little bit of respect. We aren’t best friends, but I still see my grandkids, “Julie” (16F) and “Ron” (15M), and my son “Tom” (38M). Recently, for Julie’s 16th birthday I bought her a car and some new high priced jewelry. She loved it, and Lily and Tom were grateful I did.

Well, I guess Jack found out from Facebook because he called screaming at me about favoritism because I haven’t bought his kids a car. I told him 1. His kids still aren’t old enough to drive. 2. I tried to buy them nice things when they were kids, but Mary said it overstepped her boundaries. 3. I’m not even allowed to see them so the envelope full of money I send each holiday should be enough.

He didn’t care. He said I was favoring his brother and this is why he didn’t want to see me and I’m an asshole.

So am I the asshole for not buying super expensive presents for grandkids I’m not even allowed to see?

EDIT/UPDATE: I want to say thank you to all the comments. While I think a lot of you don't mind your manners, I appreciate everyone who pointed out how my grandchildren might feel. This isn't about Mary, it's about them. I still don't think I'm allowed to send them gifts, so I think for now I'll make a saving account for all the money I would have spent, for when they're 18. That way they can know I was thinking about them. ",1
"So let me preface this by saying that \*I AM AT LEAST AN IDIOT\*.  I may not be an asshole, but I was in the wrong at least partially - I started it, even if I wasn't the first to escalate it.  My guess is that the consensus will be either YTA or ESH.

So this starts before the line-cutting part.  I got zero sleep Thursday night.  I was completely sleep deprived - and when I haven't slept in 24+ hours, I tend to get nauseous.  On my way to the ferry, I threw up in my car.  I tried to aim out the window at the last split second, but I missed and got a lot of it on the interior and my clothes.  I was now not only sleep deprived, but nauseous and light-headed from throwing up.  I wasn't at my full facilities.

Anyway, I ended up making a wrong turn on my way to the terminal - probably from being distracted by everything that had just happened - and I drove through a series of backroads that ended up talking me to the half-way point of the ferry line.  There were cars on both sides.  What I SHOULD have done was make a right turn and go to the back of the line - but there was a small opening right in front of me that was big enough to fit my car in.  Tired and sick, I decided to pull my vehicle into that spot in the line.

A couple minutes passed, and this woman from a couple cars behind me comes up to my window and tells me that I should have turned right and entered the back of the line like everyone else - and she wasn't wrong - I was about to say something along the lines of ""Aw shit, you're right - I'll pull out and go to the back"" - but before I could speak, she continued, in a sharp tone - ""and by the way, I am going to report you to the ferry staff"".  Suddenly, a mix of emotions ran through my head.  I ended up saying ""Fuck you, b\*\*\*\*.  Go fuck yourself."".  She looked at me dumbfounded and walked off.

Afterward, I pulled out of the lane and went to the back, which I would have done even if she hadn't threatened to report me, and we both end up getting on the same ferry after about an hour an a half.  We end up running into eachother on the ferry.  I was in the galley, and she sees me.  As I try to avoid eye contact, she smiles and says ""Hey, you made in on!  Doesn't it feel good to get on the right way?"".  As she's walking away, I turn my head and say ""You know, if you had just asked nicely, I would have gone to the back anyway."".

What pissed me off wasn't that she wanted me to move to the back of the line - I genuinely felt bad about that and would have done it anyway.  What pissed me off was her tone and that she threatened to report me instead of simply asking that I go to the back of the line.  I've been taking this ferry for 15 years and this is the first time I have done something like this.  Then again, she had no way of knowing that, so IDK...  I guess what I'm asking is ""I made the first dick move, but did she go too far by threatening to report me for it without hearing me out?""

Edit - I cannot prove whether I am telling the truth when I say A) my decision to cut in line was the result of impaired decision making, and B) whether I really would have moved anyway if politely asked.

I suppose for this incident, there are two possible scenarios, depending on how truthful I am being.

If I am lying about any of this, then I definitely AM the asshole - but what if I'm not lying? What if I'm just a clumsy idiot?",1
"My 9yo son Caden is becoming quick friends with a new neighbor boy. Those two gave been spending like 10 hours a day together. This boy has three other ""brothers."" The youngest is his stepbrother and the oldest has a totally different last name than the dad, boys or stepmom.

I know that she usually wears jeans and shirts that I would classify as a step above t-shirts, but a step below what she would wear into the office.  I've  asked this question to her many times before and she always gets annoyed, and I don't understand why...I mean, it's just a question, and I'm just making conversation.  Is she overreacting or AITA?",1
"My ex and I got a divorce when our son was six. When he was eight I started dating my current husband. On the day my son met his stepbrother they stood in front of each other, sized each other up the way little boys do, and were silent for a moment. Then my son asked ""do you want to play Smash Bros?"" and his stepbrother said yes, and then ran upstairs. It was fraternal love at first sight. They've been attached at the hip ever since. 

My stepson's mother passed a few years ago, and my husband was actually reticent to introduce me and my son to his two kids, because he thought it was too soon. It turns out that where some kids get a pet after a parent dies, my stepson and stepdaughter got a brother. The first year we were all together my stepson asked if my son could come along when they visited their mother at the cemetery on her birthday, and he spent the whole car ride over telling my son all about her, and it seemed therapeutic for him. Later that night I checked in and saw that my son had climbed up to the top bunk and they had fallen asleep curled up together. Before she entered her current 7-going-on-17 phase my stepdaughter used to crawl into my son's lap as often as she did my stepson and ask them to read to her. 

Since the divorce my ex husband has been unreliable at best. He cancels on my son regularly, making some excuse about work or what have you. The twice monthly weekend together have trailed off to the or four times a year. Every time I have to tell my son his father cancelled, my stepson goes to his father and asks if the three of them can do something together. 

One of the few things my ex husband likes enough to always follow through with is camping. He's planning on taking my son to the Poconos in a few weeks the weekend after Father's Day weekend. My son lives camping as well, and he's the one who convinced my stepson to join Boy Scouts next fall. The thing is, this year he wants to bring his stepbrother along. 

I told my ex husband this and he got upset, saying that it's their time together and he doesn't want someone else's kid along with them. He says that it's supposed to be the two of them bonding. I told him he's had plenty of chances to bond that he blew off for one reason or another, and that he should consider himself lucky that he has such a compassionate and sensitive son and that our son still wants anything to do with him. He hung up on a huff. His mother called yesterday to complain that I was expecting my ex to just sit their while my son and stepson went off on their own and ignored my ex completely, and said that I need to look at it from his perspective since he only ""gets"" to see our son a few times a year. For obvious reasons this annoyed me to the point where I hung up. My husband says that he gets it and thinks I should let it just be the two of them. AITA?",1
"I know upon reading the title alone, many of you will just call me an asshole, and you might be right, but I want to explain myself first.

My wife and I have been together when we first met in high school. We were able to maintain a long distance relationship throughout college and stayed true to each other. I truly thought we were inseparable. She gave birth to a boy 12 years ago, and since then things changed drastically.

My son unfortunately has behavioral problems and it's been very difficult raising him. He throws temper tantrums, gets in trouble in school frequently, refuses to listen to my wife and I. 

As a result, my wife and I started having disagreements about how we should handle him (i.e whether to punish more, let him get his anger out, etc). This created a wedge between us that kept getting wider. We both resorted to drinking more and wanting to be away from each other as much as possible to get some relief.

We started having more arguments and eventually it became so obvious that our marriage was deteriorating that family members started questioning it. So the topic of divorce came up and we both decided to go through with it. 

When I first told my son about it, he cried endlessly then started throwing fits about how unfair it was. I completely understand that a divorce is hard on any child, but the intensity of his fits kept growing. Since my wife and I are separated (not yet divorced) and because she can't tolerate our son that much, we agreed that he gets to spend most of the week with me unfortunately, so I see him a lot and have to put up with his yelling far more than she does.

Last Friday he started asking if my wife and I forgave each other and I told him that the divorce is happening like it or not. He starts crying and I got mad and told him ""buddy, want to know why we are getting divorced? Because of you, we were happy before you were born but you always act bad and get in trouble, so stop arguing with me when you caused it, you have nothing but yourself to blame.""

This devastated him and I did apologize but I told him there was some truth to what I said. However, since then he's been more quiet and behaved, even my wife, who was with him over the weekend, said he was much better. So yes, I think I am the asshole for telling him he was the reason we are getting divorced, but in some ways I don't think I am because maybe it was just something he needed to hear?",1
"Me ('A', F23), and my 2 friends ('B', F23 & 'C', F23) are all close friends who decided to move in together after Uni.
 
We stayed in one place for 12 months but moved to a new flat as B found her room too small (it was all we could find after 6 months in our budget). The new flat we found was a final option before having to renew the original flat or become homeless. This new flat is a 6 month rolling lease, then we just provide 1 month notice to leave.
 
Before signing, we all agreed to stay 12 months due to moving costs and C not being able to do a short lease due to exams and travel plans - otherwise she'd have had to find somewhere on her own.
 
The agreement falls apart as B's partner has got his dream job offer starting in September - in London (we're up north). B now wants to move out in September with him.
 
This is against the 12 months initially agreed. We tried to compromise from 12 months to 10  (October) for various reasons. September is not possible for C as she is in America for 3 weeks with work which would overlap the lease end date of September. In July & August, C is on study for her final qualification exam and then goes away for 2 weeks. I am a nurse who works 12/13 hour shifts, including nights. Neither of us can do viewings or do the physical process of moving out in September and believe October is a good compromise (even if its not the full 12 months). C and I can't comfortably cover the cost of the 3 bed flat. 
 
We discussed the above with B, who was unwilling to listen to our points. There is nothing requiring her to move in September as they both plan to live with B's partner's parents for a bit before renting their own place. After the initial meeting, B agreed that if she doesn't get a job starting in September she will stay to October, however, we know she is telling jobs she can start in September anyways.
 
Our final proposal is an October move out date, and if she is required to move in September due to a job, then she must cover any costs which are not dependant on the number of people, e.g. rent, council tax, and we will split  costs of breaking 12 month agreements, e.g. insurance, broadband.
 
We feel like B is being unreasonable as she is only considering her wants and not considering her two close friends at all. There is nothing requiring her to move by September and nothing stopping her from staying until October, where as C will not be in the country to move out in Sep and this will be my 6th move in 5 years and so I am not keen on having to do the whole process again in even less than a year now, and due to reasons that aren't even my own.
 
TLDR: 3 flat mates agreed to live together for 12 more months. 1 flat mate intends to leave the lease 3 months earlier than agreed. Me and the other flat mate want them to stay and respect their commitment, or compromise at 2 months earlier than agreed. Are we TA?",1
"Throwaway because reasons...My boyfriend (40M) and I (33F) have been together for five years and are trying to organize our next holiday. He's settled on a destination and so excited at the idea of a family trip. We're looking at flights that will likely be at least 9 hours long with business class flights, resort stay, and plenty of experiences. He makes significantly more than me but we will split the cost of the holiday 50/50 including my child's costs.

The problem is he does not want to let my child (13) on to the same class on the plane as us.He thinks that my child should be grateful to be getting an international trip and just enjoy the movies and whatever other amenities there are on the flight. That they can pop up and visit us whenever in business class and that it's not worth the extra cost, even if he were a millionaire.

I feel like it's weird to sit apart from my child for a 9+ hour flight, even if they're comfortable enough on a plane and I'd probably prefer to downgrade my flight if bf is unwilling to split that specific cost.He thinks I'm being weird for wanting to make that concession and it's not a big deal for child to fly alone.

So, WIBTA or am I being a helicopter and stressing over something silly?

Edit To Add: Just as a further explanation for why he's against it.   
He has a view where children might not appreciate the value of business class and that his parents went on business class while he flew economy on his own.

He absolutely wants to enjoy the business class for himself for the long haul on a nice plane. He's fine with me sitting in economy also or bumping up my child at my own cost, even though he disagrees morally and thinks I'm being kind of silly, he would accept it.

He has spent plenty of money and time on my child, for birthdays, events and milestones. They get along well and have had very few upsets. Every now and then I've had to stick up for one or the other but I feel like that's to be expected with blended families.",1
"I (a 14 m) have been given the opportunity to be the ring barer to my aunt and uncle's wedding next year, even though my social anxiety will probably kill me on the day

 btw my aunt and uncle are 26 and are made for each other 

The wedding's going to be small and local (emphasis on small and local) and will only have family and friends there.

Majority of the people there will be my uncle's family and friends as my me and my aunt's family are either not local or we just don't talk to them (I won't get into the drama lol but let's just say her mum is not exactly the nicest person). 

The drama arose when my Great Grandma (her grandma) found out they were getting married.
My grandma's in late 70s and lives in France, our Great grandad died in August so she is all alone.
My aunt had to break it to her that she isn't going to the wedding as it is a local one.

Instead of asking my mum for her number to face time or call, she emails her.
Her email sounded passive aggressive.

My Grandma called my mum that day crying because she found out that she wasn't going but she respected my aunt's decision and understood.

My  granddad's memorial is in April and she is coming to  England to do it as everyone else in the family lives here. 
My aunt is convinced that Grandma will make it all about HER wedding.

In my opinion she is selfish and self centered when Grandma has stated that this will be about Grandad and catching up with family (most of which me and my sister have never met). 

Aunt now has decided not to go due to her theory about grandma going to be ""guilt tripping"" her.
She then email grandma with a nasty email about how she wouldn't be going.

This email wasn't rude but it came of spiteful. her texting does come of rude

Grandma calls mum again crying and talking to mum.
She only has my mum to talk to as well as her friends and my Great uncle as our other relatives are busy

Anyway, grandma email my Aunt just letting her know that it is OK and all that.
WELL Apparently my grandma mentioned talking to my mum and she aunt was livid and went of on my mum.

She then out of spite, invited my other

She did this to get back at my mum and great grandma basically to show her that she could invite grandma but she won't.

TO PREFACE- I respect that it is their wedding and money and that they can invite anyone the want to their wedding but I think she should have actually kept a level head and not be spiteful. She should have instead explained on a call after her work if only for 15 minutes.

I don't know if I should just stay quiet or stand up.

My uncle has kind of been a middle man, he honestly didn't know what to do, he is rather dopey lol.

Anyway, WIBTA if I refuse to be tge ring barer to my aunt's wedding?

PS: I am very sorry for bad spelling/ bad structuring.
I'm typing on a phone with terrible autocorrect lol
Plus it's almost 4:30 am lol

"I (16F) and my friend, who we'll call Bart here, decided to hang out. It was Bart's plan and they chose 2 PM for the time. We would be meeting at an intersection in the road by a strip mall. It was a pretty hastily and casually planned thing.

We got our rides arranged and I texted Bart that I'll be arriving soon. My mom drops me off at 1:57 at a dollar store since she didn't want to stop in the middle of the road to drop me off and all. I wave goodbye and she drives off.

Since I have some time to kill I decided to grab something from the dollar store before going to that intersection. It was also -6°C and pretty snowy out. I grab a drink (Rockstar Silver Ice) and head out to wait for Bart at the place we planned.

And I waited.

45 or so minutes with me waiting in the snow for Bart. They didn't show up. 

Now here's the thing, I don't have a phone. Whenever I hang out with friends I usually use their phone if needed or borrow my older siblings'. That day said sibling was busy. Bart knew that. So I was waiting there with no way of contacting Bart or my family to come pick me up.

Luckily, my sibling messaged Bart and they figured out I was stuck there. So my mom picked me up and drove me home.

On the car ride back I explained what happened. My mom scolded me for not going directly to the meeting place, saying that I could have been kidnapped or gotten frostbite. I was silent the rest of the ride and when I got home I went to my sibling.

I read their text messages with Bart. Turns out Bart arrived at 2:10 and didn't see me, so they left. At 2:10 I was probably at the cashier or walking from the dollar store. From what I know Bart made no attempt to even wait for me.

Was it my fault for straying or Bart's fault for not waiting?",1
"I (26F) have been with my boyfriend Sean (25M) for about a year and a half. It's been great, but I let him know from the outset that I was a recovering alcoholic. He had no problem with that, and he still drinks with his friends, but won't do that in my presence. It still bothers me that he drinks, but it's his life, I can't tell him what to do.

Fast forward to last Sunday, and we're at his apartment. I come in, and he's in the middle of making pasta sauce, and there's a large bottle of vodka on the counter. I didn't say anything about the bottle, but he saw me staring at it, and he told me it's for the sauce.

Pasta sauce he's made me at least twice a month for the entirety of our relationship.

He said he's told me from the beginning he does that, that it cooks away, but I think that would be something I would very much remember, and I got a little angry. I knocked the bottle off the counter and went to my mom's.

He's called and apologized for triggering me, and that he was being brainless, but he wants me to pay for the broken bottle, which he says was about an $80 brand. I told him that I wasn't under any circumstances going to pay for something he's been lacing my food with for years.

We haven't really talked since, and my mom wants me to just go ahead and buy the thing to make amends, and I'm still refusing. AITA?

Edit: I didn't smash the bottle, I pushed it off the counter and it broke. I didn't throw it.  
Edit2: alright, I get it. I'm going to get him $80 worth of stuff to make up for it. But I really don't appreciate being called violent or abusive. I've never hit him once, and I think that's a pretty rash assumption.

"I (43M) lost one of my best friends to pancreatic cancer three years ago. She loved my daughter S (13F at the time, 16F now) so much, to the point where she and my daughter had an aunt/niece relationship. 

Talking about her death is… really painful for me. We only learned she had it five months before she died, and so she made all these huge plans so she could die with no regrets. 

The week before she died, she made me promise that I wouldn’t tell my daughter because she thought it would break her. She told me only to tell her once she became a person that everyone could respect, so that she didn’t have her death hindering her. So me and my friends concocted a lie, and we told her that she was with her older brother in America. 

Just now, her older brother and one of my other best friends (43M) told my daughter and all her friends that she’s dead and left me to tell them the whole story. My daughter heard the whole thing, and now she’s really pissed at me for not telling her all this time. I’m really starting to think I made the wrong decision, because she hasn’t stopped crying and her girlfriend H (16F) and her best friends N and Y (both 16M) are all refusing to talk to me now and Y even said “I don’t get along with my father in the slightest, but I doubt he’d ever do what you did to S to me.” For context, his relationship with his father is really bad due to some personal issues and I’ve kind of become a surrogate father to him over the couple of years we’ve known each other but now he just glares at me any time I come near and hides behind his boyfriend. I’ve always considered him really level-headed and smart so the fact that especially he thinks I fucked up makes me question a lot of things. 

AITA?

Edit: Is this how you do this? I’m afraid it’s been a while since the kids showed me this place. You’re all right, I messed up. I messed up really badly. My daughter may never forgive me, which I would deserve. I think I knew it all along, but I couldn’t face it because I just wanted her to be happy. I then realized that Y’s dad uses that exact same excuse all the time. I texted S as much, and she finally responded to me. She called me an idiot and told me she can’t quite forgive me yet, but she told me she still loves me. Apparently, Y found this post and showed it to everyone else and they were just waiting for me to text them. It’s going to be a long road until I can repair my relationship with my daughter, but I signed up for the hard tasks when I became a dad. Thank you guys for giving me the kick in the ass I needed to finally own up to what I did.",1
"My mom always packs a snack whenever she travels- usually a ham and cheese sandwich. I was driving her to the airport this morning and on the ride down it came up that she hadn’t had time to go to the deli and had packed herself a tuna salad sandwich instead. I asked if it was to eat in the airport- nope. She’s saving it in case she gets peckish midair. I tried to tell her that tuna isn’t something you should really be eating in close quarters with recycled air, that the smell would probably bother other people. She was adamant that there was nothing wrong with it. I told her that if I was on that plane it would bother me. She didn’t budge. So while she was unloading her luggage from the trunk I snuck the sandwich out of her carry on and tossed it in the garbage. She didn’t notice until she got through security and then I got a pissed off text. I told her to get something in the airport and I’ll pay her back but tuna really isn’t a plane friendly snack. am I the asshole?",1
"I have a son thats entering 8th grade and a daughter thats entering 9th grade.  Both of them have always been bookworms.  Very studious and cerebral, just like their Dad.  I also played sports all through school and I value the experience that brings.  I've always tried to push them to join sports, but neither one of my kids wanted to.  I tried to insist...maybe they would have fun?  We dont know til we try?  Even just to make them exercise and meet new friends.   My wife insisted I back off.  Fair enough.  

&#x200B;

Now my daughter is entering High School and wants to become a cheerleader.  She has never wanted to do anything even remotely close to cheerleading at any point in her life.  She actively made fun of cheerleaders 3 months ago.  But one of the popular girls moved in down the street last month and she has become a mainstay around my house.  She's convinced my daughter that she has to become a cheerleader in High School because she was ""a loser in middle school and you don't want that to happen in high school.""

&#x200B;

I said no.  I dont appreciate that reasoning.  My wife explained that I dont ""know what its like to be a girl in high school"" and I say OK?  Hows that relevant?  I also dont appreciate cheerleading.  Its too dangerous.  Girls get severely injured doing that, and for what reason?  We don't have the insurance to cover it.  Lastly, I dont like the sexualization of the whole thing.  Those outfits are a bit skimpy, and we're talking about high school girls.  My wife says I'm focusing on the bad and not the good.  Most girls dont get injured.  I'm the pervert because I'm making it sexual.  I pushed for her to join a sport.  I let my son play sports.  She'll have a much better high school experience.

I'm still like...fuck that shit.  My reasoning is sound.  She's not in it for the right reasons, and the benefits are lame.",1
"Hi, I am Female (17) and my girlfriend (17) feels like I'm neglecting her because I only talk about Resident Evil. We have been dating for a few months and I've recently started playing the Resident Evil franchise. I quickly grew obsessed with the games and now I'm spending my whole vacation playing the games.

I often like to send my girlfriend videos, edits, memes or long voice notes where I talk about the game. I never knew this was bothering her until today where she said ""I feel neglected because I constantly check my phone to see if you sent me anything and every time you did it's just something about rez. I love that you're happy and enjoying the game I just never know how to respond and it's all you talk about.""

I understood what she meant because , yes, this is the only thing I'm currently talking about and I told her I'm sorry and I'll stop but then again I always listen to anything she tells me and I always listen to any interest she has and speak about even if I have no idea what she is talking about. I've also noticed that I'm always the one that starts the conversations thus it's always about Rez because It's currently the only thing I enjoy doing. She says she feels neglected but she also doesn't make much effort to message me either nor even plan events with me despite how much I invite her over to my house.

In the end I apologized because she said she was scared that I was loosing feelings because I was talking less to her which was NOT the case. I really do love her so it's upsetting to have her think like this. I think everything is fine now but I just think it's a bit silly however I might be too much in my own head to realize that it's affecting her.

Edit: I also talk to other people about Rez and they don't have a issue with it but i do understand that it can become overbearing

"I (17m) am moving in with my girlfriend (17f) and her parents. I do not get along well with them very well but have trying to make it work. They had just bought a new kitchen appliance set. Yesterday I was alone in the house and decided to make dinner for the family. After preheating the oven it began to smoke. I called my girlfriend’s mom not knowing what to do, but was brought to voicemail. To my surprise I unknowingly melting a plastic dish cover causing the oven to smoke, as well as leaving an odd plastic coating throughout the oven. Keeping in mind I have never lived in a household that stores things in the oven; My girlfriends mom calls me back after I had already removed everything inside the oven. I tell her what happened and she starts yelling at me through the phone that I am stupid for not opening it to check before turning it on, and to stop cooking because she doesn’t want her kitchen destroyed. Later that night when everyone arrived home, I did not say much due to the confrontation that we had on the phone. (I do not do well with conflict and tent to get very anxious) My girlfriend told me that i should have apologized to them for almost ruining their brand new oven, and melting the plastic. Me being upset and stubborn I do not feel the need to apologize for the accident, seeing as this is not the first time her mom has blown up on me for a simple mistake. Am I the Asshole?

"I 27f have an older sister Kara 45f. We have a big age gap but are still quite close and she is basically like another parent for me, and we got much closer when our mom died when I was 14. Kara basically raised me and is very overprotective, but in the past I have asked her to give me some space.

I have always been career focused and dated casually and nothing long term. Most my friends are married and some with kids so we are all at different life stages. My one and only serious relationship beyond 2 months was with my ex fiancé Ted however we broke up last year.

I struggled to move on and only started recently casually dating, but I miss Ted so I can’t commit to anything. Kara helped me through the break up, but she wanted me to get back together with Ted as she really liked him and even suggested that I pass up the job for him. Kara really wants me to settle down like she has and I just think we are too different in that. She is a SAHM to 3 kids and basically raising a fourth as her husband doesn’t lift a finger around the house and will kick up a fuss if the house is messy or there’s no food on the table. I don’t like my BIL at all, and have encourage Kara to discuss with him about getting him to help out around the house.

Kara called me again last night to encourage me about starting to date again, and that she set up a blind date for me and honestly I feel that’s the only thing we’ve spoken about for the past few weeks. She said she just wanted me to be happy like she is, but I then told her that her life is my biggest nightmare. She got upset and said I was being too harsh.

"I am new here so please excuse my formatting. This is a throwaway account because my wife uses reddit.

I (43M), call me Cass, married my wife (40F), call her Sam, 15 years ago. To say that our marriage has been difficult would be an understatement. My mother thought I could do better from the moment we started dating and her bad behavior toward Sam only escalated over time. 

For over a decade I was what you all describe as ""in the fog"". I decided every cruel thing my mother did was an accident. When Sam insisted on consequences, my mother often used me to weasel out of them. She is very good at playing with my emotions.

My mother also managed to convince me that, since Sam is a SAHM, she was being lazy whenever she asked me to help around the house. There was a point in time where I would not have picked up a dirty sock off the floor because that was her job. Please don't attack me about this. I know. In my defense, I was raised with some pretty skewed morals. My therapist is on it.

Sam and my mother never got along. Part of that is my fault. Sam would ask me to lay boundaries with my mother and enforce them. I told Sam that I dealt with it when, in reality, I just never brought it up. Often, especially early in our marriage, I would blame Sam for decisions that my mother disliked. 

Everything came to a head when we had our fourth child(3F). Sam had a difficult pregnancy in 2020. My mother kept needling Sam and tried desperately to use me to cross boundaries. Well, Sam ended up so stressed out that she had to be induced a few weeks early. She also found out about the lack of boundary setting/throwing her under the bus with my mom as she was being wheeled into the hospital. This resulted in Sam asking for a divorce. We decided to work on fixing our relationship and part of that was going NC with my parents.

In that time our relationship has improved. I am helping out around the house and spending more time with the kids. Occasionally I will fall into old behaviors. When I do, my wife calls me on it and then brings up all the times I have done it to her in the past. It is hurtful because I am really trying and I feel like she is not moving on. 

I have also asked to resume contact with my mother. She had a panic attack and ended up in the hospital. We had a conversation afterward where she listed off times that my mother has manipulated me into mistreating her. However, I have had time to work on myself and I don't think my mother can manipulate me the way she once could.

Here's where I may be TA: I am seriously considering asking her to stop bringing up the past when we discuss our issues. While our past issues are quite large, I think it is stopping us from working toward the future. Would that make me an AH?",1
"Me(26f) and my fiancé(26m) have a small friend group that consists of two other people: We’ll call them Duke(Unsure of age male) and King(21m) we will usually get together and either watch movies or binge watch T.V. shows. We also joke around a lot and I do tend to flirt with my Fiancé a lot during this time. King for some reason really hates sex jokes and is quick to get irritated with me for telling them a lot and flirting with my fiancé in a vulgar manner. If he deems one of my jokes to be “too far,” then he will leave for the night only to demand an apology the next day. Tension has been building between me and King so one night, Fiancé attempted to get us to talk things out in an attempt to keep the peace. This only resulted me completely unloading my pent up frustrations onto King from telling him to act his age to asking him why he just couldn’t be normal even though my fiancé tried several times to calm me down and stop me. I ended up bringing King to tears. I told my fiancé that I would never ask him to stop hanging out with King but that I was going to call King out when he was acting childish. My fiancé sided with King, said I was the one being childish and hurtful and that I had crossed a line by asking King to just be normal. Now, I feel bad, AITA?

"Hey I'm 29 my husband is 34. We have an 5 month old daughter. I have decided I want to become a veggie mainly for enviromental reasons. I've been considering doing this for some time as I think meat production has a hugely negative effect. Having our daughter has made me a bit more eco conscious as I am afraid of the world she'll live in in the future. I've been trying to reduce the meat in my diet for some time. My husband doesn't want to do this and complains every time I cook a meatless meal. I am a SAHM at and cook almost all of our meals. I've told him I don't want to cook meat anymore and that if he wants to eat meat then he can cook it himself and that he is lucky I am cooking for him everyday whatever I cook. However he says that I should also at least cook meat and add this to the meal for him. He says I can't force him to change his diet and eat less meat but I say that I'm not as he can still cook him meat. He says it is unfair on him to force this major lifestyle change on him. And he thinks I am being hypocritical and petty not cooking meat anymore when I've eaten it all my life. He thinks it is silly me not cooking meat for him if he is going to do it later, as I am just saving him from cooking meat and the amount of meat cooked will be the same so he thinks the only result in this is me not doing something nice for him. But I think doing that would be a massive inconvenience for me and also it defeats the purpose of me becoming veggie in the first place. I do kinda understand his point of view. He also is unhappy that I plan to cook veggie meals for our daughter and thinks it is unfair to force her into being a vegetarian but again i don't think I am as I don't plan on stopping her eating meat in school etc. Just wondering what y'all think about this?",1
"I (28m) and have been married to my wife ""Bella"" (28f) for 5 years.

We both met and went to the same college. She pre-law while I was doing animation. She graduated top of our class and went to a T20 law school. While she was in law school, I had a lot of trouble finding a job in my field or a job at all, really. I ended up working in a kitchen as a line cook to help support us (in addition to loans she took out) while she was going to school so she could just focus on her classes.

Bella got a very good job in a different state after she graduated, so I quit my job and haven't gotten another one since. We have no kids, a nice house for the two of us, and are overall living very very comfortably. She works very long hours, so I take care of most of the household things. Cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping, re-painting the walls and doing other work and renovations to the house.

In the last 6 months Bella's started referring to me as her ""house husband"" around our family and friends. I've mostly been letting it go but every single time it bothers me. I'm already insecure about not being able to find a good job and it makes me feel even more inadequate. I finally got to the end of my rope when we were with her mother on Sunday, who still doesn't really approve of me, and they were talking about taking care of the lawn/garden and she said, ""Thank goodness I have a house husband for that or I'd never find the time"" and smiled at me. Then they both laughed. It was humiliating. 

I didn't say anything at first but I guess she could tell that I was really upset and asked what was wrong. I told her that she needed to stop emasculating me and making it seem like I didn't contribute anything to the household. We were arguing back and forth and she told me that she would stop calling me a house husband if I was going to ""get that upset about it"" but that it wasn't an untrue term and I needed to stop being insecure. 

Bella refuses to apologize. I feel like she doesn't fully appreciate my value as her husband. I've stopped doing the chores until she apologizes and she is beyond pissed off. She's been coming home and cooking dinner (only for herself) and doing the chores I haven't and then taking off to spend the night at a friends house. I was talking to my sister about it and she told me that Bella was wrong but I was being immature in my response. The thing is, if I give in she's going to keep thinking what she's been doing is okay. I don't even know anymore. AITA?",1
"Background: My daughter Lydia is 17 and about to start her senior year in high school. Our kids go to a moderately expensive private high school that costs $30k per year each. They have gone to this school since kindergarten.   We have told them that, for college, we will continue to pay up to this amount per year for tuition/room/board but if they choose a more expensive school, the difference is up to them.

Our daughter asked if she could flip it - if she took community college classes in high school, lived at home to finish her AA and her bachelors degree, would we apply the difference to grad school. We thought that sounded great. 

She was supposed to have a very hard to get internship in her desired field this summer and so her plans were to do her internship and take a few classes. The internship got fucked up at the last minute because of COVID ( her internship would have her at a hospital) and so she has a LOT of free time. She’s disappointed and we’re doing our best to be understanding.

Lydia is, frankly, a slob. Her room and bathroom aren’t just messy - they’re filthy. Her home office is also a train wreck. This has been since she was small. She has ADHD and executive function issues (sees a psychiatrist and a therapist, on medication), so I know it’s a struggle. I don’t expect it to be spotless, but I do expect it to be CLEAN. Like, not a biohazard. I have offered to help, I have had her spaces cleaned professionally and taken pictures for her as a model. Charts, lists, apps…nothing works.

Anyway, that brings us to today. I asked her to help me out with Task X at home today while some relatives we see a lot were over. She completed about 1/3 of it and wandered off. I was like uhhhh? The rest?

Lydia said “you asked me to HELP you didn’t ask me to DO it. I have schoolwork.” She was genuinely confused that I was so pissed.

I confess I snapped. I was like your room, bathroom, and office are still disgusting, you procrastinate your schoolwork until the last minute! You don’t do anything all day, why am I even asking for simple chores to be accomplished?! If this keeps up there’s not a chance you’re living here after graduation as an adult!

She was mortified because her younger cousins were there and was like WELL YOU DIDN’T CLARIFY! and stormed off.

She’s generally a good kid and I know she’s disappointed about about her internship. I think I may have gone too far with my threat. On the other hand, I am so fucking tired of micromanaging simple tasks that I’m also totally serious.

* * * * * 

Edit: Thank you for the feedback! I went to her and apologized for being out of line with losing my temper. She said I was very much out of line but that she also understood why I was pissed. I told her that I am frustrated about it in my home, but also worried that I’ve failed her on basic skills that, whenever she moves out, she’ll need. She said I’ve done a good job trying to teach her but that she’s just messy.

We’ve agreed to spend 15 minutes a day together helping her maintain her spaces. We figured 15 minutes a day will be short enough that we won’t get burnout/want to strangle each other.",1
"Our son is 2 and right now he’s going through a phase where his dad is his absolute favourite person and he’s practically glued to him. It’s come at a good time since we’re visiting my husband’s family so he’s available to spend more time with our son than he normally would be. 

My husband’s cousins wanted to go out on the boat with my husband. They were discussing it in front of me and I let them know they would have to take my son with them if my husband went. They told me it wasn’t a good idea for them to take him and made up some lies about how it would be dangerous for him to go with them. I suggested they do something else then because my son wouldn’t stay in if his dad was going out. They kept trying to convince me to keep my son home and even asked me why he couldn’t stay with me at one point. Eventually my father-in-law told them they could only use the boat if they took my son too which is the only reason they finally backed down and agreed. They weren’t happy about it, though.

My husband wasn’t there during the conversation as he was bathing our son but he didn’t seem concerned about taking our son on the boat which is why I know they were just making stuff up so he couldn’t go.

AITA?",1
"I (27F) was invited to my roommate's 'Nina' 25F family NYE party.
Her family is Russian and they had a huge spread and everyone was super welcoming and friendly.

Our other roommates 'Tina' and 'Alex' were also invited.

Nina's grandmother kept offering me food, and I didn't want to be rude, and the food was delicious.

Tina and Alex were side-eyeing me every time I accepted another portion but Nina's family kept offering me more food.

When it was time for dessert, Nina's grandmother brought out this big layered crepe cake, some kind of traditional Russian dish, and served it up to everyone.

She seemed so happy I liked the food, and told me to have as much cake as I wanted.
It was so good I ate 3 slices and put 3 more slices in a Tupperware to take home.
 There was one slice of cake left. Nina's grandmother offered it around and no one wanted it so I took it.

I thought everything was fine and I had a great time, but right as we were leaving I heard Nina complaining to someone that she airways looked forward to leftover cake.
In the car in the way back home, Tina and Alex made comments about how much I ate and I got mad at them for food shaming me because it was none of their business and everyone was offering me food.

Then Tina saw the cake in my bag and started yelling at me and saying how rude and embarrassing I was and that I ate too much, and we got into a huge argument because I felt like she was criticizing my body and food shaming me.

Now Tina and Alex aren't talking to me and Nina says I should have at least shared the cake with her.
I don't see what the issue is i mean they offered me the food and all the portions I was just being polite and enjoying myself!
I didn't deserve to get food shamed by them, but I do feel bad since Nina said she was looking forward to cake leftovers.",1
"Disclaimer: Everyone involved is around college-age. I was in a discord call with one friend group (that I have grown up with in person) and I was in-person with another friend group at my house. The friend groups do not know each other at all. One friend in the IRL group (We'll call L) decides that it would be funny to turn on my discord camera and moon everyone in the call. He did it before I could turn off the camera. All I heard on the other end was ""Ew, yuck, that's wild"", but nothing more, and I was not worried that anything would happen since they normally can take jokes and have crude senses of humor. Next thing I know, a video of what happened gets posted to our private discord chat by one friend (we'll call him ""C""), and we all laugh at it and we begin to move on. Then, one of my friends in the discord call (we'll call him ""G""), decides to save the video from the chat and draft up a report to the school with the video and the names of the people involved, so that they would get in trouble. He did this because he said that it was ""the right thing to do"" and that he ""needed to bring justice to the community"", although I know that was a load of BS because he is normally the least-bothered person when it comes to gross things like that. I told him that it would cause alot of problems that he didn't want to start but he insisted on sending the report. After this, me and my friend group IRL started profusely apologizing saying that the whole thing was a dumb joke and that nobody was meant to be offended, and that things are going too far. After this, G, C, and another friend in the call (we'll call Z) began to make fun of him and harass him, and make him play games with them in order for the report to not be sent (EX: roll a dice with me and if you guess correctly, I'll show mercy). They made fun of him relentlessly because they had the upper hand and were holding this report over him, which we knew could ruin both his school career and athletic career, since he is an athlete. I asked G why he was doing this, and he said that he was ""Hating because I like to hate"". In the end, due to encouragement from C and Z, G sent the report and now we found out the we have to go to a student court and that could L could get kicked off of his sports team, over something so menial that I know for a fact did not mean anything to anyone involved. Now, L and everyone in the IRL friend group are asking me for their names so that if they do end up getting kicked out of school and off the team, to sue for the harassment, since they (and I) both believe that nobody was actually hurt by this, and that this is something not worth losing a career over at all. They (and I) believe that C,Z, and especially G were doing all of this just for jokes/out of malice and deserve to be held responsible for their actions if things escalate to the level of a career ending. WIBTA for giving the IRL friend group the names of the people from the discord friend group?",1
"My niece (6th grade) attends a private school that's affiliated w a church on the same campus. My sister works at the school but isn't a teacher. A few weeks ago, my sister told me that one of the mean girls in class had filmed one of my niece's friends while changing in the locker room. My sister told me the mean girl's parents had taken her phone away, but she said, and I quote, ""I don't think the school is doing anything about it. Very hush-hush."" My sister also told me that she was still being mean to others. It REALLY got under my skin, the fact that it seemed the school was doing nothing. But I can overreact, so I sat on it for a week. I called the police today 
and told them I wasn't even sure if it was criminal activity, but I had to say something. They also asked for my name and info, which I gave. I called my sister and she got very upset and informed me that the school HAD, in fact, done something. The girl was suspended (idk how long) and put in counseling. She went off on how she works there and that's her community not mine and it's her main source of income and why didn't I think about that before saying something bc it could get back to her since her sister is the one who said something. I told her I didn't think there would be any way anyone would know I'm the one who filed. Then she said that the girl needs help and grace, not punitive action. I asked her if she'd feel that way if it had been HER daughter filmed and humiliated, and she said yes, that involving cops is too much. I told her I found that to be enabling behavior. The police called me back so I informed them that I was mistaken and the school HAD, in fact, held the student responsible for her actions via suspension/counseling. The officer thanked me, and we left it at that. I don't think they will do anything about it. At least, that was the impression I got from the officer. I called my sister back and told her as much. She seemed worried I was upset with her, and she also changed her tune and said that she really doesn't know what she would have done if it had happened to her own daughter. But I sort of got the impression she still thinks I overstepped/that it wasn't my business. I did apologize for calling the police w out double checking w her about an update on the situation. I don't think I would have called if I had known the school had suspended her. But I'm not sure. Filming someone (a child!) while they change, and then making fun of them and sharing the video with others is a bit above ""normal"" bullying imo.

I want to stand by what I did, I don't think I was wrong to try to stand up for the other girls in that class. But I feel embarassed after speaking to my sister. I didn't want to upset/hurt her. (We did end the conversation on a good note, though.) I also feel like I definitely should have checked with her for an update about it, but she never brought it up again so I thought nothing had changed.

Aita? 

Edit: I'm getting that I was the AH, and I accept it. But I mainly only agree with active-anteater1884's assesment and I am grateful for that insight.Moving forward I will be more thoughtful.",1
"
My f24 brother 'Adam' m30, met a single mom f32 (from latin origins) 'Michelle"" a year ago and they recently got engaged.

We only met her few times but he brought her and her son over for dinner on sunday. Tbqh, the family and I didn't know much about her so after dinner we started talking to her about her personal life. She told us she has only highschool education/degree. She said she always wanted to go to college and obtain a degree but said that ""it was so hard to do"". I found that a bit cliche. especially after she started complaining about lack of opportunities and resources. I told her I disagreed because colleges give all kinds of opportunities and scholarships and that the real reason she couldn't go to college was because of the fact that she was a mom and had to raise a kid. She stared at me silently looking offended then asked if I was implying that her decision to be a mom ruined her opportunities. I told her only she could answer this question once she takes a look at her life and see if she's really happy where she is .vs. where she could've been without the whole struggling mom thing. She got upset and told me that she's happy with her life and her job at the salon. and said that she did not appreciate how judgemental and condescending I was towards her and her child. Adam heard the comotion and asked what was going on. She told him and he decided it was time to leave. She couldn't even wait or say goodby she took her son and went to wait in the car.

Adam chewed me out saying it was non of my business how she's living her life, but I explained that I was stating an opinion, nothing more nothing less. Mom sided with them saying I was out of line rude and ridiculous but my younger sister said that Michelle was being too sensitive and she should get over herself already. Adam left and then mom called him in the evening next day then came into my room to yell at me saying I made Michelle cry with what I said.

Now mom wants me to apologize but I'm not sure wether I was out of line here.",1
"I (hopefully) will be getting married this October to my amazing fiancé. We’ve been together for 4 years, since we were 18. 

Over the past few weeks, my friends and I have done a weekly zoom call to gossip and discuss details. I asked them all to send me their intended hair and makeup for the day, to which they all did and I thought it was a reasonable request. All of them went for very similar, apart from Madeline. Madeline is the only one of the group who has hair past her chest, and due to the style, she wouldn’t be able to do the same style as everyone else. I gently suggested that she cut her hair to be able to do the same style as everyone else. 

She asked if i was being serious and I said yes, that I wasn’t planning on asking but that it seemed a simple thing to do. My friends were all pretty outraged over this minor thing and now Madeline is saying she doesn’t want to even be my bridesmaid. It’s only hair, it grows back! AITA?",1
" 

My wife found out about my affair two days ago.  I’ve been trying to explain to her that I’ve been feeling like there’s no intimacy between us for a long time. This isn’t something that just happened, we’ve been in a downward spiral for the last six years. Up until last October we barely saw eachother. She would go on walks before leaving for work and I wouldn’t see her until later that night when I climbed into bed next to her sound asleep. We’ve been living like roommates and staying together for the sake of our kids, who are six and eleven. I don’t know if she’s cheated on me, but I suspect so, and really I don’t care, our relationship isn’t about us anymore and it hasn’t been for a long time.

I say until last October because she was diagnosed with breast cancer. I’ve been by her side giving her the emotional support she needs and taking care of her when she’s helpless due to chemo. If she’d gone to screenings like I’ve suggested to her over the years they could have caught it early enough that treatment would’ve been more effective. But at this time we’re planning our last Christmas together. 

I know it was wrong of me to cheat, and that probably makes me an asshole. But she wants to tell our kids that mom and dad need space from eachother and that she wants to move in with her mom. I think it's better if we act like nothing happened for the sake of our kids so that they have the memory of a happy family for the last year with their mother.  And if we live separately the kids will eventual find out why we split and they might hate me for it, causing lasting damage to our relationships. Of course, if she somehow makes a recovery, I'm more than open to the idea of a divorce.

Am I the ass-hole for wanting to stay together for the sake of our children?",1
"Throwaway account since she's on Reddit, but I [19F] have a friend [18F] who we'll call Mandy. Mandy and I became friends in high school, and we recently started going to the same university since it's the closest one to our hometown. We have dinner together every weeknight, and sometimes the conversation veers towards high school and the people we knew there.

Now, Mandy was kind of odd in high school. (She still is, really, but now she hides it better in public.) She would make off-colored jokes, talk loudly without realizing it, just be generally socially oblivious. There were plenty of people that did like her, but there were also a lot of people who really didn't like her for that. I knew a lot of people throughout our graduating class, and a lot of people thought she was really weird and annoying, but she was talking about these people like she had a pretty nice relationship with them.

I thought that, if I was in Mandy's shoes, I know that I would want someone to tell me the truth instead of just watching me be delusional. So I told her that a lot of the people from our high school didn't actually like her that much, and that they thought that she was really weird and annoying.

I was wondering if I made the right choice pretty quickly after I said it, since Mandy was kind of quiet for the rest of dinner. I tried to make it better by telling her that there were also people who did like her, but she didn't seem to care much about that. This happened about three days ago, and Mandy still seems kind of off. I'm wondering if it was a better that I told the truth, or if I should have just let her keep living in delusion. AITA?",1
"I (40f) was a single mother to my daughter, Amy (15f). I came out 3 years ago and married my wife Jenna (42f) last year. She has a daughter, Nora (13f). We all live together as I have full custody of my daughter. It was kind of hard for her to adjust to having a second mom, but they got along well.

The girls have their birthdays very close, only two days apart, so we decided to have a joint birthday party for both of them, since Nora had a hard time making new friends (they moved in with us and she's very shy). Most of my family lives out of the country, so the gifts were sent a week early. It was a huge bag, with at least 20 gifts. The party was nice and we opened the bag at night once everyone left.

Jenna handed out the presents as she took them out. After 12 gifts in a row just for Amy, I checked the bag and froze to see that there was only one gift for Nora, from my parents. She pretended it wasn't a big deal, but as she opened the present I saw her eyes drop. It was a $15 tumbler from Walmart. Not to sound ungrateful, but Amy's gifts were much more expensive (lots of gift cards over $100, a new phone, limited-edition Funkos, designer clothes and lots of cards wishing her a happy birthday).

Needless to say, I blew up the family chat, calling out my parents, siblings, and extended family who sent gifts for not considering Nora and my parents for the cheap gift. No one took me seriously since: *""It's not our duty to give gifts to someone else's kid""* and *""Amy deserved them, since I didn't even throw her her own birthday party"",* emphasizing that Jenna and Nora are my problem, not theirs.

Nora was clearly hurt, since it's not the first time my family has left her out. At night, I asked Amy to share some of the gifts with her stepsister. Not all of them, just a couple of gift cards and some of the new clothes. Amy refused. This surprised me, since she never had a problem with sharing and even though she and Nora are not BFF's, they usually get along. After asking why, Amy started crying, saying that she never wanted a joint birthday party, and that I force her to share everything with Nora. They share a room for space and I make sure they're both invited to the same parties and sleepovers, so that Nora won't be left out. If they don't invite both of them, then either of them goes.

Amy stated that she at least wanted her own gifts to be hers alone. I scolded her for being selfish with her stepsister, grounded her and took a couple of the presents to give to Nora. She turned them down because she didn't want problems with Amy and it felt like pity. Since then, Amy has been cold to all of us. I just wanted my two girls to be closer with the joint party and have the same things. AITA?

Clarification: Jenna and I bought gifts for the girls (their own tablets), as well as their friends. Nora also received gifts from her extended family, but they sent for Amy as well.",1
"My daughter (17f) has always been a smart girl. She has a huge potential future available for her. She has the ability to become one of the greatest data scientists ever. It's an incredibly rewarding job for her, especially since technology is the way to go for the future and the country we live in is expensive. As a computer scientist myself, I've always loved my job.

However, she does not want to be one. I've been influencing her since she was 10. She was initially excited but doesn't want to anymore. She took 2 tech classes in grades 9 and 10 and she isn't taking one in 11th or 12th grade. She says that she wants to be a psychologist and now wants to have a business major. I don't it's a right fit for her, the former because she doesn't have the social skills needed to become a psychologist (she's autistic). Hell, she couldn't handle her brothers well, how is she supposed to deal with adults with psychological issues? The latter as well because it involves dealing with people that can be immature as hell. Also she took a business course in grade 10 and she ended up not liking it so why would she take an entire university program.

Yesterday, we sat down and were looking at potential programs. She picked a few from bachelor of commerce programs. I tried pushing her to pick the bachelor of computer science programs. At the end, she asked if I would support her no matter what she picks. I laughed at told her not to give me a scare. ""So it's a no then?"" she asked. I told her that she can take her highlighter, highlight the programs she's interested in, and we can discuss. She said that I criticize every program that isn't tech related. I tried convincing her that the tech field is a very rewarding field and she is smart and capable and then she snapped.

She said that she doesn't care if it's a gold mine and she's capable enough to handle it, she hates the computer tech field and I've been forcing her to do it for a long time. She says it's her future, not mine, and not everyone wants to be a tech scientist. She asked how I feel if my father tried to push me to the law field since it's a rewarding job despite me having no interest in social sciences. Then she stormed out

At that point, I realize that I may have pushed her too hard. I just want to her to have a bright fututre and no struggles,. But I guess went about it the wrong way.",1
"i (16) am allowed by my mom to go out with my friends every saturday. i have a rather large group of friends, and they all get home late, even by 3am at times, and i'm always the lame one for having to go away first.

Now i'm not saying i want a midnight curfew at 16, but i argued with my mom that picking me up at 9:30 pm sharp is a bit excessive since i mainly just hang out in busy streets in a very tiny city where there is a close to zero crime rate. 

She argued that going out every week and ""making her go through the trouble to take me there and pick me up once a week is already tiring enough and i can't juet make her get out of the house at half past ten when she's already tired from work"" 

(mind you shes been picking me up for like two months before, since my friends' parents got sick and tired to take me home just because my mom didnt want to pick me up herself).

I argued back that i do everything to please her: i do everyone's laundry, wash everyone's dishes and keep my room ALWAYS spotless even though my puppy basically lives in it 24/7, moreover i have been taking take care of my 3 year old brother almost constantly since he was born, cooking for him, playing with him, bathing him and more recently even letting him sleep in my bed and taking care of him for multiple nights on end and then taking him to school by bike (a bycicle, so yeah, a good workout HAHA) the next morning when both my parents have a night shift at work.

i know its not okay to weaponize my little brother as an argument, and i take care of him happly because i love him, but i'm literally his dad by now for fudge's sake, i deserve a bit of freedom, do i?

So i asked her to at least loosen the curfew to half past ten and to not get mad at me randomly everytime she picks me up, but it sounds like i'm asking for something impossible, so is she right? am i the asshole for asking her to pick me up even if she's tired? should i just stop hanging out or just get home by foot?",1
"



I got invited to my fiance's family christmas celebratory dinner. It's my first christmas with them. I have always been picky about what I eat. Can't help it and it has to do with psychological factors, childhood, and personal likes and dislikes. Before accepting their invite I let FMIL know that I wouldn't be eating the traditional food at their celebration, and showed her a variety of dishes to choose from to accommodate me. She refused and told me to bring my own dish. I said if I had to bring my own dish when I'm a guest then I better stay at home then. We went back and forth and I insisted I wouldn't come if accommodations weren't being made. I just thought it was a simple request and FMIL could've agreed if she really wanted me there. My fiance agreed that I shhould bring my own dish but I didn't.


When we arrived there and I saw that no accommodations were made I got up, go my things and walked out and went home. My FMIL and fiance were shocked. I got tons of calls and texts from them both and my fiance came home lashing out calling me selfish and spoiled to walk out like that over a dish that his mom didn't have to make for me. and, that it was my responsibilty to feed myself. How is it my responsibilty to feed myself when I'm a guest? Makes no sense to me. I told him this and he accused me of starting shit and ruining my first christmas with his family and disrespecting his mom.



Now he's continuelly saying I fucked up and should've sucked it up for the family's sake.


ETA to clear few points:


* For those saying I have no respect for my inlaws. I do, especially FMIL. I respect her but this is so far the biggest conflict we had.


* I work long hours even on holidays so not much time to cook.


* I wasn't asking for an elaborated dish or several dishes. Just one simple option.",1
"I (22F) am engaged to S(23M). S and I do not have a wedding date set yet but it will most likely be spring or fall 2024. We haven’t really even started planning yet as we are trying to gain our footing so everything about when and where is subject to change.

I am vegetarian, S is not. I was thinking of doing a buffet style potluck as we plan to keep our wedding quite small (probably around 100 people). 

S is a Norse Viking and I grew up Christian. I do want a modern and traditional wedding but do intend to include some traditions from S’s beliefs as well so my wedding won’t be entirely traditional like my grandparents would like.

I also don’t plan to have a white dress as I am quite pale and white washes me out (definitely not a virgin either). My grandmother, M, is big on tradition. My grandfather, J, is as well but he’s not as  strict or hellbent about it as she is. My mom, F, and dad, T, would also like to see a traditional wedding for me but they just want to see me happy.

M is very strict about tradition and family image. Upon her discovery of my autoimmune disease (she placed her hand on my shoulder and felt a scar caused by my condition) she stated I needed plastic surgery to get them removed as her only granddaughter when I was 19. She insisted on taking pictures of them (after I told her no) to show her dermatologist.

M also wasn’t pleased by the fact that I moved in with S so soon after we started dating (both my parents were in quarantine so I stayed with him for a couple weeks and then he offered to move me in because things were going so well at that point) we were about a month or two into the relationship and have been together for about a year and a half now.

S and I got engaged in secret and still haven’t told our families as we don’t want them to judge us for moving things too quickly or for us wanting to marry so young. S got my dads blessing several months ago and my side of the family has been pushing him to pop the question. Our friends have asked when he plans to also.

I would like my grandparents there for my wedding day but quite frankly I don’t feel I should have to deal with M’s judgement on such an important and special day. WIBTA if I didn’t invite her?",1
"This happened before the coronavirus was a thing in case you’re wondering. Obviously right now we’re staying in as much as possible and supporting local business through take out and delivery. 

So this was over a year ago and my wife won’t let it go. I’m looking for some external input. I took my wife to our favorite local spot for her birthday. Everything was good as usual, but we had a server neither of us had seen before with a somewhat striking appearance: she was completely bald. Normally I wouldn’t say anything about something like that because I’m afraid of being rude, but toward the end of the dinner the server made a joke about she and I having the same haircut (I’m bald). 

I said something along the lines of, “I don’t mean to be rude, but I’m curious. Are you bald by choice?” It turns out she was, which was a great relief to me since I didn’t want to pry into it if she was sick or involuntary bald for some reason. She was more than happy to talk about it and told me all about how she’d always loved bald heads and wanted to try it. She said she got positive feedback and just kept her head shaved. I told her I loved that and I thought women could look very beautiful bald even though it’s not something you see often. I told her she had a great head shape for it and joked about offering razor recommendations. It was light conversation and that was the end of it.

For the rest of the meal my wife was silent. I could tell something was wrong. When we got to the car, there was a moment of pause between us and I asked if something was wrong. She replied, “Are we going to stop at Walgreens and pick up some clippers?” I asked her what she meant and she said obviously since I was enthralled with our server’s shaved head she had to do something to win her husbands attention back. I was “blatantly” flirting with our server, apparently. It spiraled into a huge fight with my wife accusing me of wanting to experiment with an exotic-looking woman because I was tired of my boring old wife.

I can’t deny that in the moment, I probably looked like I was flirting with our server. It was not intentional, but I guess I realize how it could’ve seemed inappropriate at my wife’s birthday dinner. I did find her attractive, but my wife will always come first. I’m attracted to her and I love her. That’s why I married her. Even now she makes little references like “I guess I’m not as interesting as a bald goddess” or “Does this look good on me or do I need to show some scalp?”

So am I the asshole for this? I just want things to be okay. I’ve tried apologizing but nothing will stop it.

EDIT: I’m starting to see people making comments that seem to indicate it is never okay to talk about balding in public. I reject this completely. I did not bring this up out of nowhere; the topic came up when the server pointed out (in a jovial fashion) that she and I had the same haircut. It was a brief conversation with zero negative or uncomfortable vibes, and when we left I said bye to the server and she pointed at her head and gave me a little thumbs up. I get the feeling we would’ve got along well as friends. So this isn’t the issue.

EDIT 2: Good grief you guys, let me clear something up. My wife is 25 and I am 24. The server looked older than both of us, probably early 30s. So anything saying in flirting with a younger woman is wrong. Also my wife suggested I don’t find her attractive anymore which is completely wrong. Why would I marry someone I didn’t think was capital H O T?? She’s plenty attractive.

I’m reading everything you’re sending and it’s split down the middle as far as I can tell. All I can tell you is please read carefully. No one was trapped in a conversation with me they didn’t want. As I said the server got my attention as we were leaving. Do you get the attention of people you’re glad are almost out the door? Also I don’t remember the conversation down to the last detail but it was maybe a minute tops. Hope this gives things a little more clarity.

EDIT 3: Lmao yall I see my post got tagged. I don’t know if that means they counted or what but I guess what I’ll do is apologize to my wife in a more formal way and see if she’ll tell me why she’s been bringing this up over and over. She doesn’t even seem mad anymore really, it’s just coming up every time she talks to me it seems like. And I never addressed it but I already apologized sincerely right after this happened last year. And again numerous times. I don’t know how I can do it any better.

Also yall are ridiculous! I got two messages saying I should get divorced by her immediately and one person said it was evidence of some kind of crime and I should be in jail! Yall I can’t with that one, but thanks to everyone who gave me reasonable input. I guess when this many people see a post I’m gonna get a few unhinged people. I will make a update if I ever get to a solution if this sub is okay with that.",1
"i know i'll 100% skip school, because it's 6:40am rn and i still haven't slept one bit. school starts at 8am.
i also know i'm probably the AH. but let me give you some context.

my teacher assigned to make a presentation and divided us in groups. in my group there is me, three girls (G,S,A) and a boy (K)
the presentation was assigned on the 24th of November due to 22nd of dicember. 
instead of a normal PowerPoint, we had to make an animated video with our voice speaking. (so we don't have to show ourselves and we repeat the lesson in the video)

in those 20+ days, everyday i told the group that there was a lot of work to do, and they wouldn't listen or do anything.
on the 18th, i almost started an argument, saying that we need to get the work done. A then says ""we shouldn't worry because (my name) is going to edit the video quicky!"" i was a bit shocked, bc editing a video is quite a long process even if you're good at it, and more importantly, we were supposed to edit the video together.

 the work i was supposed to do was to extract the audio from all the videos, search images that match what the others said, match when the image appears to when the person said it, and other troublesome work. i had to use canva, as it is the only app i know how to use.
they sent the videos THE AFTERNOON BEFORE it was due, after i begged them for the whole day (and for the whole week, and the week prior).
S has a speech impediment, which i can totally understand, but in the videos she totally read what was in the research sheets that our teacher gave us (she was supposed to resume it and change the words) and it was barely understandable since she read it without any commas or periods. G and K sent the videos decently. K was the only one who actually put in some effort. A didn't send me the video at all bc she fell in the morning and she had hurt her jaw or something (she was alright a week later)

i wasn't able to finish it in time of course, and i had a fever, so i skipped school the next day. G and A didn't come to school either, so K and S managed to talk to the teacher and we're supposed to present tomorrow (or today? well, at 10am).

during winter break, A didn't send me anything, and no one offered to help. i had some serious family issues so i wasn't able to continue the work.
on the 7th (so yesterday, even though since i didn't sleep yet it seems like today to me) at 5pm A sent me the video. i spent all afternoon, evening and night editing the video, but i wasn't able to finish since i had to film MY video and edit S 2nd video.

for more clarification, the research sheets our teacher gave us were 12. i had 3. K had 4. G had 2. S had 4, two in the first half of the whole research, and the last two in the whole research. A had 2. (in the beginning, S had 2  and A had 4, but after A fell, S decided to take her sheets instead)

i know it is my fault bc i should've insisted for them to help in the group project. i don't really know how they'll react or the teacher, but i did what i could.",1
"I(31M) recently completed my PhD and a postdoc position. I didn't make much money during that period, about 26k annually for my PhD, and about 32k while I was working as a postdoc. My wife(30F), who I married about when I got my PhD, makes a shitload more than me, or made a shitload more than me. She made about 100k while we were together, so quite a bit of a gap. She also came up with the idea that we should put some of our income for ourselves and some for the family, and this would be proportional to our income, to keep it ""fair"".

She always got a bit fancier stuff than me, and I was pretty jealous. I didn't voice it to her, which I guess should've, but I don't understand how she doesn't realize it.

I don't want to reveal too much information, but while I was working as a postdoc, I made connections with a couple people who were starting up a company. Long story short, last year I made 300k without including my stake in the company. It is obviously risky, but I think the risk had paid off for me at least.

I did get a Tesla Model S, which I am entirely paying with my own money, including the insurance. And I'm starting to buy more expensive stuff for me too, and it honestly feels amazing.

Now, she is asking if we should just combine our incomes, and each get the same amount of ""our money"", which feels like total bullshit. She wants to eat her cake and have it too. And I just said no, she wasn't being fair. She then went on a spiel about equity, which I honestly did not listen to. I mean, she is allowed to make that suggestion, but I am allowed to say no, right?

AITA?

"So my boyfriend (24m) and I (20m) have been together for about 4 months, recently I had just been fired from my job resulting in me being quite financially disadvantaged whilst I search for a new job. My boyfriend brings in about 10k to 11k a month and spends his money on his car and food only. This month my loan is due and I didn’t have enough money to make ends meet so I asked him if I could have $200 for this month only that would strictly go towards my loan, he replied that as long as it doesn’t become a regular thing as his ex did something similar and he had no money to spend on himself. This upset me because comparing your current partner to your ex is thoughtless and it made me think that if times got tough he wouldn’t be there to help me, if it’s not money he can dump towards his car or endless fast food than nothing else is worthy of his money ",1
"I was backing up in a parking lot and I accidentally bumped someone's car. There wasn't any damage, we didn't even need to exchange insurance. But afterwards, he goes ""were you even looking?""  
He was parked in the middle of a one way parking lot that's narrow blocking me and about four other cars from backing out, and also was stopping two other cars behind him from passing through the parking lot while waiting for his friend to get food or something I guess? Am i the asshole here",1
"I meant this as a joke and I have a kind of dark humor but everyone says I went too far. This happened about a month ago. I’m 16 F. A new girl moved into my town and we quickly became friends. She’s one of the only black people here. We became cool and one day she invited me over to her house.


I was expecting her parents to be black but they’re white. And also rich as hell. I was shocked to see her house and her parents. She was having a conversation with her mom and I just thought it was kinda funny seeing a black person call a white person “mom”. Later when we went up to her room I cracked a joke saying “Haha it’s so weird to see you call your mom “mom””. She asked why and I said because of the difference of the way you look. She laughed and we moved on with the convo.


But apparently she’s been telling people I made a rude joke to her in her own house and that she thinks I’m racist. I didn’t mean it in a racist way, it was just a dumb joke. She even found it funny. Now she’s spreading these rumors like I said something actually racist. My friends are saying I should apologize but I don’t see why. Was it wrong?",1
"My wife(26) and I (M29) had our first son about 10 months ago. Because childcare is costly in my area, along with the obvious risks regarding daycares, we agreed that she’d be a SAHM. So i picked up more hours at work. I work the graveyard shift in a warehouse 12hrs a day Sunday night through Thursday night, and 6-8hrs on Friday night. For a grand total of 66-68hrs a week. 

By the time i come home in the morning my wife and son are both up and shes making breakfast for us while feeding our son. I’ll usually take my food into our bedroom and eat in there before winding down for bed. But I usually don’t fall asleep until around noon. So I don’t get much sleep.

Recently however she started bringing our son into the room with and asking me to play with him or give him a bottle and a change before i go to sleep. But i thought thats what she was for considering all she does is take care of him. Id do it usually but it’s been really irking me.

This morning it got heated when she tried to hand me my son as im getting ready to fall asleep. She said that i needed to “step up more as a father.” I laughed and pointed around and said “well im paying for this house we’re living in, the clothes our son is wearing. The formula and water that he eats and his baby food. We agreed that you’d do the house stuff, why is it now my responsibility and why right before im going to bed?!” 

She didn’t say anything and just took our son into his room and locked the door. I texted my mom and she started reaming me out. But honestly this was our original agreement so I don’t see a problem. This is extremely frustrating and i think i need someone from the outside to give me a perspective. 

AITA for laughing at my wife when she asked me to watch our son AS IM ABOUT TO GO TO BED?


Update: i wrote this post right before going to sleep, and i picked it back up about an hour ago. I am definitely an asshole here, i was tired as was she and i lashed out. She doesn’t deserve that. I showed my wife this post. She’s having a great time reading all the YTA comments. Im going to start eating breakfast with my family, theres obviously a lot i need to improve. Im going to work now so i wont be able to read the comments anymore until i get home tomorrow morning. Thank you for the slap of reality.",1
"Hello. My girlfriend, myself, my parents, and my brother and his wife all went on vacation in another country a week ago. My brother and I were the ones who did most of the planning of the itinerary although we did ask everyone else for input. For background, I make around $150,000k as an IT consultant, my girlfriend is a teacher making $45,000k. My parents are pretty affluent as well as my brother and sister in law.

My girlfriend knew this trip was coming up and took on a second job waitressing on the weekends for several months to get ready for it. We have always split things 50/50 in the 2 years we have been together. There were a few times on the vacation when she did not go on outings with us- wine tasting/scuba diving/etc. She also would only eat 2 meals a day, simply stating that she was on a budget. My family does favor more high-end (\*expensive\*) places. My parents thought it was very strange that she only eats 2 meals a day although normally she eats 3. 

When we got home I asked her why she skipped out on several of the outings and only ate 2 meals a day- I mentioned how I heard her stomach growling one night and said I was concerned about her having an eating disorder. She got teary eyed and said that 3 meals a day wasn't fiscally feasible for her and neither were the outings that she chose not to go on (she went on 3 of 6 outings). She said she was not expecting everything to cost so much and she was overwhelmed. 

She also said she doesn't know if this is going to work long term if she is expected to go on vacations like that with people who make so much more than her. I feel bad that I did not pick up on her discomfort sooner. But we did agree to split everything 50/50 and I don't know why she agreed to come if the cost was an issue.",1

She says that my attitude is the reason I'm still single and that I need to stop being such an asshole.

"I (f27) and ""Marcus"" (m36)are each married to a brother(28) and sister(32), respectively. Marcus is a nice guy, a good husband and father. I am also happily married. But I would never say that Marcus was particularly attractive. My SIL always seemed to think so, but whatever. I had not seen him since their oldest daughter's birthday in February. Rewind to the previous summer he wore a Tshirt into the pool because he was a little self conscious. Fast forward to a few days ago at a fourth of July cookout. We arrive say hi to everyone and we ask where is Marcus and his wife ""Lindsay"" says he's outback still grilling. I walk out back to say hi and he is surprisingly shirtless. Granted it was 95 degrees in the shade that day, so I get it but still. He had a major glo up. He had lost 40 lbs. He had muscle definition, etc. I embarrassed myself. I went to hug him and he just fist bumped me, ""I'm sweaty"". And I said ""I don't care"" and hugged him anyway. I told him he looked great and left it at that. He didn't seem uncomfortable.    

 When he came inside after he had finished grilling everything, he stopped at the fridge for a drink where I was talking to Lindsay. He totally caught me checking him out, and borderline sprinted upstairs joking to his wife, ""I think I'm indecent"". So here's where I may have messed up just a bit. I asked ""When did Marcus become gorgeous"". I expected playful banter with my SIL, who I've known for 15 years. Nope. She said he always has been and called me a ""little shallow for just noticing now"". I don't want him, trust me. But her saying that made me subconsciously pay him more attention. 

Add in the fact that I had already pregamed before we got there and drank a lot of wine while there. Honestly though, it should be really no big deal. Marcus always seemed a little unsure of himself physically, so what is wrong with a little confidence overload? I don't want him so there's nothing wrong with believing him to be more attractive now.",1
"My brother died. He was an incredible, funny guy, I miss him like I lost one of my limbs. Maybe it’s stupid, but I want people to remember the person he was. My dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very Catholic funeral service. He wasn’t Catholic and wouldn’t like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn’t know there. He’d think it’s way too fancy, way too much. 

He and I had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, I guess). He told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while “It’s Raining Men” played in the background...obviously not an option....Also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like “Highway to Hell” and “Another One Bites the Dust.” 

To remember him, I want to bring a speaker and play “Another One Bites the Dust” at his wake. I would explain it to the people at the wake and say that I wanted to preserve the person he was. Maybe I could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. There will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren’t very familiar with him and are Catholic, so I’ve been thinking maybe not. But I really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. I think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it. 

WIBTA?

Edit: I didn’t really expect this response, but thank you. My brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. I swear, I almost sense his hand in it. I don’t know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, 

This morning, I talked to my dad about the wake. I suggested, as some of you did, that maybe I could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. I found a violin one that I really liked. My dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and I made. He actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. I hadn’t really been thinking about my Dad as much as I should have, I thought of him as opposition, I guess he cared way less about the Catholic stuff than I thought. 

I also reached out to some of my brother’ s friends. Some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. We are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we’re going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

Thanks again.",1
"Back in May, a student of mine emailed me 2 days before when her final was scheduled. Her twin brother passed away early that night due to the negligence of a drunk driver. She said that she does not think she would be able take the final and asked if she would be able to reschedule. I sent my condolences and let her know that she could have as much time as she needed and that I will get in touch with her later in the summer.

Due to administrative policies, Friday was the deadline to submit extended deadline grades. I told her she could take the test as late as July 16th if she wanted a grade for the semester. Alternatively, I could give her an incomplete, which is essentially the grade of “could not complete the class for extenuating circumstances”. Lastly, she could apply for a leave of absence, and would be able to able to complete the final when she returns. She thanked me and told me she will get back to me with her preference soon.

I emailed her again 3-days later and asked if she had a preference regarding what to do for her final. She didn’t respond, so I emailed her again on June 24th, July 1st, July 8th, July 12th, and July 15th. I also mailed a letter to her place of residency that essentially said the same thing, and left a voicemail on her cell phone. 

She failed to reply to any of my means of communication, including the ones that told her that without a response, I would be forced to give her a 0 for the final, which was worth 50% of her final grade. In order to qualify for an incomplete, she would have to sign a form and have it looked by both the professor (me) and her faculty advisor. The “leave of absence” is a Student Disabilities Services policy, so I couldn’t do anything with her going through them.

Because she did not get back to me, I submitted a 0 for her final and she failed the class. I told my husband this morning  about what happened (he is also a professor at the same university) and he was completely aghast. He told me I should’ve just made the final not count towards calculation for her final grade, or just say she got a passing grade on the exam. That would mean I would have to essentially lie, which I was worried because it would have looked suspicious if her other professors said she was similarly irresponsive to their emails. 

He told me the other professors probably waived her final completely and what I did was morally reprehensible. He works in a different department, so he’s used to having a lot more freedom regarding the grading scheme, but my hands were tied. We fought and he’s insistence that I “should’ve done more to help her”.

I get his perspective, but the fact is that she plainly did not respond to my messages. I did what I could, but he thinks I should’ve just lied and hope I didn’t get caught. Am I in the wrong for failing her?

**EDIT:** I truly did not expect this response. I'm going to draft an email to my supervisors and see what can be done. I did not mean to argue with my judgment (that's why all of my comments were removed; I did not delete them). Whatever the case, I'm going to do what I can to make this right. Thank you guys.",1
"Today's my 21st bday and I planned a party where all my friends would all get together and play videogames all night long. I posted all the meetup's details on all of social media a couple weeks before it started, and we got a list going of who was planning to show up.

My best friend has been busy with college for quite a while now, so I wasn't surprised when he wasn't acknowledging the party plans much at all, we have only been occasionally sending each other messages to check on each other.

Everyone I expected to come made it and we had a great time... until my best friend messaged me, clearly upset. He said I made no effort to let him know it was my birthday or that I was throwing a party, and he told me to not talk to him again for a while. I told him that I treated him with the same amount of fairness, time, and respect I gave to all my other friends, but he didn't seem to care.

"I (32M) was going to meetup with some friends with my girlfriend (28F). She sat down on a bench at the bus stop and did not realise it was wet and got her skirt wet, she thought it was piss but I don't think it was as it was brown not yellow. I suggested we just go and it would dry off anyway but she didn't want to as she had convinced herself it was piss.

She asked me to go to a nearby store to buy her a pair of knickers and a new skirt but I did not want to as I did not want to be seen like a creep buying women's clothing. I offered to her her some unisex pants instead but she insisted and said she really wanted a skirt. 

She then went and got her skirt and we took the next bus and I thought that was the end of it.

But then when we got back home, she got upset with me and said I should have bought it for her, or at least come in the store with her as it was embarrassing to go in like that. But it was embarrassing for me too and I shop at that store and did not want to become known as the creep who buys women's clothing. I had offered to buy her pants but she declined.",1

One day, Anna and I decided to go to a restaurant, and we informed Alex beforehand. He explicitly told us to make sure that there were no peanuts in the food. Unfortunately, in the midst of ordering our meals, I completely forgot about Frankie's allergy, and she ended up eating something with peanuts in it. This resulted in Frankie having a severe allergic reaction and requiring immediate medical attention.

Upon learning about the incident, Alex understandably became angry and upset. He directed his frustration towards me and Anna, stating that we should have asked about the presence of peanuts in the food. Furthermore, he expressed that he no longer wanted me around Frankie if we couldn't be more responsible I busted out in tears. This argument escalated, leading to a major fight between Anna and Alex and ultimately causing their wedding to be called off .

"My dad is pretty rich and is retired at 50. He was dating this woman ""Laura"" for a couple of years and it worried me that she was just after his money. She's 35. My dad said he'd never marry or have anymore kids (besides me 24m) because he wants to leave everything to me.

Last year dad texted me and said he had some good news about him and Laura. I thought they were going to get married and I was going to tell him to get a prenuptial to make sure our family money stays in the family.

No. He and Laura were going to have a baby. I told my dad he was gross for having a kid at 50 and now he's on the hook financially. He said he was thrilled to become a dad again. I told Laura she was disgusting for tricking my dad into becoming a dad and she's not getting any of his money when he dies. My dad has like 5 million in life insurance policies.



She said she was insulted by what I said and I said I call out gold diggers when I see them. Of course ever since my brother was born she keeps asking him to change his will. I told my dad she should get a job and not to try to live off him.

Edit: My dad is worth more than his life insurance policies. I have a trust and get money every month and now I'm worried that Laura might expect one too. What if my dad dies and leaves everything to her and then she dies and leaves everything to her family? That means my family's money and property goes to a gold digger. Laura hasn't had a real job and she's pushing 40. That's sus af

\------------------------ Original Post Below ------------------------

I know it sounds bad, but I'm not really sure how to feel about it.

For backstory, I'm 17 and my brother (I'll call him Ethan, not his real name) is 10. Ever since COVID hit, he's been super annoying and always wanting to spend time with me. I can understand this to a certain degree, as not being able to see his friends as much has made him turn to me more for friendship. But we don't like any of the same things so it's really hard to relate to him or want to spend time with him. I'm into reading philosophy and listening to classic rock. Ethan likes to play Fortnite and is obsessed with TikTok and rappers like Travis Scott... anyways, my mom has noticed that he's been trying to spend more time with me so every Sunday she makes me take him to get lunch or ice cream at one of the neighborhood restaurants. I kind of think it's a waist of time because it's not gonna lead to a friendship or anything (because we are so different), but sometimes we've had a laugh or two on these Sunday lunches.

Anyways, onto the story. Yesterday we were eating lunch at the diner and my biggest crush in school walks in and sees us. Immediately I was already embarrased to be seen with him, but I tried to keep my cool. My crush comes over and asks if she can sit down and I say yes. She chats a bit with me and then tries to get to know my little bro. She asks what he likes to do and he tells her ""I really like playing Fortnite and watching Marvel Movies."" At this point I'm rolling my eyes because I doubt my crush even knows what any of that stuff is. She says ""Oh thats so cool"" or something like that but I can tell she's forcing it. I try to change the subject but she keeps going back to Ethan for some reason. Eventually she starts asking about his friends and he says ""Well my best friend in the world is my brother"" and looks over at me and I just wanted to sink in my seat. Idk what came over me but I said angrily ""We're not friends, I'm only hanging out with you because I have to"".

Of course, he starts to cry and embarassing both of us. My crush wasn't really saying anything. So I made something up about needing to bring him home and I walked back home with him. He told my mom what happened and my mom grounded me (I'm literally 17 and she is still grounding me). And she said she was disappointed in me for not being nicer to my brother.

So I do feel guilty about making him cry but I do think he should grow up a bit and rely on his own friends, rather than clinging to me and trying to embarass me in front of someone I like. Am i the asshole?",1
"I’m (F, late 20s) studying Japanese and I am nowhere near fluent yet. So I’ve been chatting with a Japanese man (M, late 50s) since last year to study Japanese and help him study English.   
We’ve gotten along really well for several months. We usually talked about our daily life and we both love cooking, so we shared pictures of our food often.  
Recently, we started to try eating healthier and exercising more. So we talk about what ingredients are healthy, good eating habits and so on. We were talking about how it’s good to make leftovers if you make too much food. He mentioned that sashimi is not good to eat as leftovers though.   
He loves eating sashimi often in Japan and I remember that I recently heard that raw chicken sashimi is popular in Japan. So I asked him if he eats raw chicken and it turns out that he does. So I told him to be careful and that it could be dangerous since I saw foreigners but even Japan warning about food poisoning and salmonella.   
He said that if Japanese people warn about it in English it has no value and that food poisoning is super rare. He also said something about that the foreigners talking about raw chicken being bad was Chinese people pretending to be Taiwanese people? I don’t really know what that means but I guess it’s a political thing.   
I grew up always hearing that raw chicken can contain salmonella so when preparing it you need to wash everything it comes in contact with straight away and cook it thoroughly. Even if the risk of salmonella is low, raw chicken apparently contains something called campylobacter that can cause food poisoning.  
I heard that some Japanese people eat chicken sashimi and gets food poisoning afterwards but still continues to eat it, so it just made me worried. I totally understand wanting to eat something that might be bad for you because it’s delicious. I also understand that criticizing another country’s food culture was very rude of me. I was just worried for my friend.   
He got really mad and said that chicken is cleaned and prepared carefully and that it’s very rude to disrespect other countries food culture. Which I totally understand and I felt awful about that since I’m not super educated on how chicken sashimi works in Japan.  
I read a few articles in English and Japanese about it. This is one of the articles I read from the Food Safety Commission of Japan website. (It’s in Japanese though.) https://www.fsc.go.jp/iinkai/20shunen/03\_campylobacter.html   
In the article it basically says 10,000 people annually get food poisoning from this in Japan. There were fewer cases though since 2020 because of the Corona pandemic.   
I tried to apologize several times but he would not accept it and did not even want to clear up any misunderstandings. He said he wanted to end our friendship over this which broke my heart.  
AITA for worrying about my friend’s wellbeing from eating raw chicken since it’s a delicacy in his country?

"My (21f) sister (32f) has been married to her husband 33m for 8 years. They already have 6 kids total, the last one born 5 months ago. 

Yesterday, my sister had announced that she's 3 months pregnant with twins and while everyone was congratulating her, I said out loud ""oh my god, again?? Can't your stupid husband leave you alone??"" I didn't mean to say it out loud, but it slipped out and my sister looked at me angrily and literally dragged me into another room and asked ""Why tf did you say that?""

I told her that she and her husband have been pregnant every year for the last 8 years and that she needs to take a break. I was worried about her having so many babies in such a short time and I didn't want anything bad happening to her. 

She then said ""How about YOU leave us alone and worry about your own shit? This is MY life, so f*ck off"". My mother told me that I should apologize for being rude but I told her that I won't apologize for showing concern.

But now I just can't help thinking that maybe I was being an asshole and sticking my nose into other people's business. I was just worried but maybe I was being a jerk.
 
AITA?

Edit). Yes, I do babysit my sister's kids sometimes, and all 6 of them at the same time whenever they need me to and if I'm available. They pay me $30-$50/hour, but their kids are pretty destructive and they don't respect other adults like they're supposed to, so it's a full chore watching after them. 

I'm aware that the ""stupid husband"" comment was inappropriate, but I have almost no filter and my stupid mouth says shit before my brain can stop it.

And ummm.... I've seen some comments talk about the ages and assuming my sister is 21? I'M 21f, my sister is 32f, and her husband is 33m.

UPDATE). I apologized to my sister for insulting her husband and making that rude comment but I told her that I'm still worried about her having so many kids back to back and that  just concerned in general about her health and well-being. 

She actually forgave me, and she said it's because 1. I'm her youngest sister, 2. She knows about my problem with keeping my thoughts to myself and that I'm working on myself, and 3. She knows that I am concerned for her and she appreciates it, but she has assured me that she's fine and said that this pregnancy wasn't planned and her husband plans on getting a vasectomy because they both want this pregnancy to be the last.

For those asking in the comments, she and her husband can afford to have kids. He runs a very successful business and she is still co-partner with her best friend in a company that they both started before she got married. How she manages to juggle being a full time mom and work here and there is beyond me, but she does. That's why I babysit sometimes when the nanny isn't available 24/7.

Her husband was the one who initially wanted a big family and my sister just went along with the idea. But that's their business.",1
"I have an 18 year old son. He has a lot of freedom and I don’t really have any strict rules for him or my other kids. The only thing is that everyone has to be on their best behaviour when my grandma (so my son’s great grandma) visits. She’s very religious and has some hardcore beliefs. If she was younger, I’d definitely call her out on them (and I used to) but she’s so old now that it doesn’t seem wise to argue with her every time she visits (which is barely).

Now my son has had his ears pierced since he was a kid. My grandma used to comment on them a lot but I shut it down and she agreed to not say anything to his face about the piercings. He normally only wears studs or little hoops. 

He recently got these fake plug earrings. They’re pretty cool and they suit him very well. He likes them a lot too. Well my grandma came over for dinner last week and she noticed them and immediately told him to take that nonsense off of his ears. I told her that it’s just a fake piercing and he can wear whatever he wants but she started making a fuss. 

Now please trust me, if it was anyone else I would’ve told them to either suck it up or leave but I can’t do that with her so I asked my son if he could just take them off for two hours. He said no. I said I understand he doesn’t want to but it’s not worth the trouble so please just take them off. He got annoyed and said he’s not gonna take them off and if my grandma has a heart attack then so be it. This just made my grandma even more upset and she started implying the piercings messed with his brain. It was so ridiculous and she eventually made me call my brother to come pick her up before my son’s evilness spreads or something. I told her to watch what she says but my head was pounding because of all the yelling so I don’t remember much. 

I figured it was over after she left but my son’s really annoyed with me for asking him to take it off. He thinks I should’ve stood up for him and that they’re just earrings. I agree with him and I apologized but I explained that sometimes we need to choose our battles wisely. Because him taking the earrings off is way easier than reasoning with her. And because of family reasons (not financial) we cannot cut her off. He’s still upset though. My husband said he’ll get over it and my other kids are saying that they get where he’s coming from but it’s not a huge deal. 

I don’t know, AITA? I feel bad for hurting his feelings but at the same time I don’t think it was unfair of me to ask him to take the earrings off. ",1
"Today is our 3 year anniversary and I had previously planned a trip for us but that was canceled for obvious reasons. She was a bit upset about that so I decided to make the day special by giving her a break and making breakfast as well as supper in bed and maybe add a massage in between.

So I woke up early this morning, made this amazing omlette with a lot of nice shit inside, blueberry pancakes and these butterscotch muffins (although these were meant for later). Grabbed a few roses from our landlady and made a petal pathway from the bedroom to the kitchen where the shrine of food and wine was. Everything was ready to go. That was until I got a call from my mate talking about his relationship issues. I didn't want to wake her up so I took the call outside. Maybe just 30 - 45 minutes later I went back inside and saw my gf sitting on the couch eating the muffins and drinking a glass of wine while Oscar (our dog) fucking ATE the omlette. Is that even healthy for the dog? Anyways she screamed ""Happy Anniversary"" and went to hug me but I pushed her away and asked her why Oscar was eating the omlette. She said she hated blueberries and pepper so she couldn't eat the pancakes nor the omlette but said she appreciated it. I said something about how if she actually appreciated it Oscar wouldn't be fucking eating it and she would've left it for me. She completely lost her shit and pinned it on me about how I should know she doesn't like pepper and blueberries so actually I'm the one who ruined our anniversary.

We're watching a movie right now but we still haven't spoken at all. Aita?",1
"I (28M) am I recovering alcoholic. My father was an alcoholic when I was a child and I guess I caught it from him. I've been sober for about a year now, and I attend this recovery group once a week that is held by the Mormon church. I've been gaining an interest in their beliefs and have been considering conversion, but that's another conversation.

My wife (26F) went out with her friends this weekend and I found out from her friend's Instagram post that she had been drinking. She held a glass of wine in the photo, but she didn't appear drunk when she got home. I saw the post today, and I'm going to be honest, I freaked out. She has been so helpful and supportive during my recovery, and I can't believe she would do this to me. I confronted her as soon as I saw it, and she told me that because she wasn't drinking around me, it wasn't an issue. I told her that when we got married, we promised to support eachother through everything and this wasn't being supportive and a direct violation of our vows. She told me to get over myself and I lost it and told her that was a bad wife and that she wasn't committed to us and our relationship (we've been together for four years, married for one). I told her that if she was pregnant, I wouldn't eat all of the food she couldn't eat to be supportive and she told me that she wouldn't expect that from me so I can't expect her to be sober and that I was being an asshole. After that, I just left and contacted the group leader from my recovery group and he let me chill at his house while I cooled down.

"I decided to post this with the help of my husband (who is unsure if my behavior was over the line). Here's what he thought was important for the sake of the story:

\- My friend of about 17 years (Delilah, 37f) had a very problematic childhood. She barely went to school because her only parent was addicted to substances among many other problems. I don't know how she slipped through the system for so long but she was pretty much a lost cause by high school because of how little discipline she had. 

\- At 23 her dad died and due to the matter of death, Delilah won a somewhat large sum of money.

\- Once she got that money, Delilah chose to go to a community college. I guess she learned to love learning and had so many interest she never knew about that she went to several schools in most of her 20s and came out with several degrees.

So my view: I've held my tongue on her wasting so much money on school. I guess if it was my money I'd want to save it or explore then get a degree, not go head first. She has 6 degrees and to me it's just silly. The real kicker is my husband is an engineer and makes more than she does, despite all her side jobs and projects. 

Well we were visiting her and she mentioned how she wanted to study history and maybe take a class or two online for the fun of it. I laughed and asked if any of her inheritance was still even left. She said that shouldn't be my concern. I admitted it was ridiculous, she could have just bought a nice house with that money, instead of blowing it on degrees that she doesn't even use.

She told me all her degrees served a purpose, she loves what she does now and loves learning because she was deprived of it as a child. She told me she wasn't going to defend herself to someone who did not grow in a similar situation.

My husband told her to calm down. After is now awkward and I'm not sure if I need to apology or not. AITA?",1
"Quick edit: By country, I'm referring to the typical idea people outside the South have about us. My friend and I aren't referring to rich southerners who sit on their wrap around porches in 95° weather drinking tea. We basically mean the idea of living on a farm, working long days, etc.

My friend and I (both 16) live in a small town in northwestern Illinois. It's basically Wisconsin, actually, except with a bunch of old people and conspiracy theorists who are afraid of their own shadows. And worse roads lol. I grew up in Texas until I got chased out by certain laws targeting me, and have been sleeping on my aunt's couch for the past year. (I honestly don't mind that much because she's literally the reason I'm still here. And I hated growing up on a farm and hunting.)

A few months ago, my friend got obsessed with that stupid Last Night song and decided being country would be his new personality. So now he walks around wearing cowboy boots, Those Sunglasses, and a camo hoodie all the time. He got his parents to buy him a huge truck, and he's now in our school's truck club with the other rich kids.

During lunch on Thursday, he was complaining about our ""city life"" (our ""city"" of subdivisions, a couple gas stations, and 2 banks) and how deep in his heart, he's country. I told him that that couldn't possibly be true, because he lives in a new build 4 bedroom house and won't have to work a day in his life. I told him that as somebody who'd actually be considered country, that isn't country at all. He ranted about how he'd never feel bad about his upbringing just because I feel my life is harder, and that I'm not really country because I got rid of my accent and want to go to UW. I just got up and went to another table, and we haven't talked to each other since. He's straight up ignoring me when usually he's the first to speak his mind on anything so I wonder if I maybe went too far by bringing his upbringing into it. The truck club kids generally hate me because I'm ""flamboyant"" and dye my hair, so I'm not sure whether they're being sincere, but they think I went too far by lording his parents' wealth over him.

AITA?",1
"My bf works part time for a plant nursery. His shifts are all over the place and are often 5-6 hours a day, Monday-Friday. I work full time in a salaried position that I have been at for 12 years. Every day I get up and get my daughter to school and then I start working (I work from home). I wake my bf up when it's time for him to get ready for work (he usually starts around 10-11am most days). Every day seems to be a fight to get up with him not wanting to go to work and often asking me for permission to stay home. When he stays home from work he sits and plays video games all day while I work at my desk. He can be loud and distracting. When he does go to work I drive him and pick him up. He's constantly making up excuses for why he can't go in. I'm shocked he hasn't been fired yet because he has a tendency to take off a full week and not just a day here and there. Today I have the day off as I am trying to use up my vacation time before the end of the year. When I woke him up this morning he got angry with me when I told him he had to go to work because he has only worked 4 hours this week. He said he was sick of having to work all these hours just for his paychecks to go to meand that I just don't want him home so I can do whatever I had planned for myself today. Last month he worked so few hours that he didn't have enough money to give me the $600 towards rent that he told me he would pay which basically left me to pay all the bills. For reference our rent is $2300 + hydro and utilities so when he doesn't give me that money it is a significant amount that I have to cover on top of my other responsibilities. If he worked even just his set hours every week he would have money for himself because I only ask for $600 month.

I'm so tired of having to shoulder all the financial responsibilities as well as making sure he gets to work in the first place. I'm tired of being yelled at every morning for making him go. I feel like I'm his mother not his partner. I have told him this several times but he never wants to talk about it and somehow it gets turned around on me for not being supportive of him and that I'm not perfect either. He constantly brings up that there are things I do or don't do that he doesn't like but he doesn't nag me about them, but he never tells me what those things are.

Am I the asshole here for making him go to work when he doesn't want to? Am I just a nag?

***Update*** I have read all your comments so far. For those of you who commented about my past post history, you're 100% correct that I have been complaining about him for a long time. I take full responsibility for my role in this, that I have completely enabled this behavior on his part and I am definitely the AH for that. I have been getting the silent treatment all day from him and any time I try saying anything he just walks away or ignores me. Thank you for the support and the criticism. I don't know why I haven't walked away yet. I know I am setting a terrible example for my daughter.",1
"My (20f) therapist gave me her number during one of our first sessions. She didn’t give any specific instructions as far as I remember, just in case I ever needed to reach out.

I got a new pet a few weeks ago. My boyfriend and I went to see the Barbie movie the same night, and didn’t get back until pretty late. I was excited about my new pet and was texting everyone about it around this time and decided to shoot a text to my therapist. Just a picture and a caption that said “meet <name>! new friend!”. I’ve talked to her about my pets before so I figured it was no biggie and didn’t think anything of it.

Our next appointment, before we started, she said she wanted to talk to me about something. She asked if I remembered texting her (a bit abrasively) and I was confused for a moment thinking I’d sent her something bad??? and maybe I don’t remember?? I answered “do you mean about <name>?” and she said yes. She told me it was inappropriate to send her texts that weren’t related to therapy, and that it was VERY inappropriate to text her so late.

I was really taken aback by all of this and thought about it for the rest of the day (and further obviously). I wasn’t intending to intrude at all, nor did I expect her to respond at that hour. There were no further texts other than the picture with the caption. I’m just confused as to whether or not I was way out of line? It’s been on my mind a lot lately.",1
"(Throwaway)  
Last year, my girlfriend (F29) managed to get two concert tickets to see Taylor Swift in Paris this May. Taylor is her favourite artist, and after missing the sales for all North American tour dates she signed up for international pre-sales and it was kind of an impulsive decision when she got these tickets. She paid for the tickets but I thought I would make it up by paying for flights and accomodations. At the time we didn't really discuss specifics because the concert felt so far away but I (M29) assumed that we were going to Paris together for the concert.   
A few days ago, I overhead her on the phone with one of her friends talking about going to the concert together.   
To be fair, I'm not nearly as much of a fan of Taylor as she is. I feel that her music is fine and inoffensive but I certainly wouldn't be going to one of her concerts if it wasn't for my partner. However, we've been talking about saving up and travelling internationally for a few years now. Neither of us have travelled out of the country (Canada) since we started dating 5 years ago, and I thought that this was going to be our chance to do so.   
Even though we never explicitly discussed that we were going together when she bought the tickets, I feel uneasy that my girlfriend now wants to take a friend (who likes Taylor Swift as much as she does) instead of me. Over the last while we've been to several concerts together every year so I assumed she was getting tickets for us because she didn't say otherwise. I feel like she may have been originally planning to go with me but reconsidered after her and her friend got worked up about getting to see Taylor. To me, it's not even so much about the concert as it is about travelling to France.   
WIBTA if I confront my girlfriend over what I thought was our vacation to Paris, and demand she take me with her to the Eras concert?",1
"My older brother started going to football practice and games during weekend and school nights. A couple days now when hes gone I have been using his room to play the ps5 and watch stuff on tv.

But hes not even using the room or ps5 when hes gone. Please help, i want to use the ps5 but not sure if he will be okay with it",1
"Alright Reddit. I’ve been getting so much shit for this that I decided to get a judgement on here. I feel like I’ve seen a post similar to this before but the judgement was split so I guess we’ll see.

So I (26M) have a long standing friend group. Most of us having been friends since HS. This girl named Zoe (25F) has been part of the group since college. We’ve hung out plenty of times. But I would describe our relationship as causal friends. We follow each other on social media and talk in the larger group but never 1 on 1 hanging out. She is friends mostly with the GFs. But I had a low key crush on her. Some of the woman in the group know but have kept it to themselves for my sake. But last month I got kinda drunk. And messaged her late night about possibly hanging out. She messaged me back in the morning and said she would like to hangout more but just as friends. I told her I understood. But knew what that meant so I never reached back out. 

So my parents own a bar. Typically I will bartend there on the weekends before I go out. My friend group are regulars at the bar. I will send out text about what specials we have that night and invite people to come. So I send out a big invite and include Zoe on it. She shows up and immediately starts talking to me. I was working so I kinda just moved along. I charged her full price the whole night and she started complaining to the other girls about it which ticked me off. Yes sometimes I will give free stuff out to my friends. But it isn’t all the time. Yes I used to hookup Zoe a lot. But that was before she said we were friends. Then the second thing that happened was I invited a girl to come to the bar to pregame with us before we went out. Zoe sees me talking to this girl. Decided to introduce herself completely out of the blue. Then those two start talking at the bar. And it “slips out” that me and zoe used to be good friends till I asked her out. The girl I invited wasn’t happy and I had to spend the next hour explaining that away. So the next time the group went out. I sent Zoe a text and told her to please not show up. She is more than welcome to meet us out later. But I didn’t want to deal with her at my bar. Her friends showed up to the bar this weekend and asked me to talk. They said it was unfair to not invite Zoe. Because now she feels isolated. Our whole friend group hangs out here. So banning her is essentially banning her from the group. I said everyone is free to pick a different bar to hangout at. And then they can invite whoever they want. But Zoe is weird and is causing issues. So it is her own fault. I’ve still being called an AH. But my guys are on my side. AITA?",1
"

Long story short I'm a little neurotic and don't think dishwashers are good for dishes. I also don't trust my partner to not put any of my nice kitchen stuff in the dishwasher that should be hand washed while I'm gone. My partner said, well before we moved in together, that in our house he wants to be able to use the dishwasher otherwise he won't do any dishes.

So we move in together and I end up using the dishwasher to store shaker bottles and plastic items, and for the past several months have been washing all of his dishes by hand. I'm so tired of it though and believe he can wash a few dishes every now and then to help me out. He points out that he already told me if he can't use the dishwasher he's not doing any dishes, but washing a dish by hand doesn't take long.

I'm getting frustrated and I'm not sure who is in the wrong.",1
"A friend of mine lost her job recently, has quite a bit of debt and other financial struggles. I've noticed their behaviors to be slipping towards depression and poor health choices.

As a person who values physical fitness I've tried subtly communicating that since they have the extra time right now, they should invest in exercise as it will lift their spirits as opposed to mindlessly scrolling tik-tok. However, nothing has changed.

At some point my friend asked me for money as a gift or loan due to their situation and I refused as I've lent $3000 a year ago that was not repaid even though my friend had opportunities to make payments or communicate to work out a repayment plan.

I made them a deal explaining that I would like to see them take action to improve their mood and offered to pay them $300-$500 per week if they work out 3-7 days per week. \[edit\] This would be paid in cash to them. Not as dollar amounts applied to the $3000 they owe me. I've basically written off the $3000 and don't expect to see it again.

Now, my friend is not fat at all, in average physical shape, think former cross country runner. However, when she told her friends about my offer, they agreed with her that I was being ""controlling"" and just subtly calling her ""fat"".

AITA for even offering something like this? I thought it was a generous way to lead my friend into better overall health and did not realize it could be offensive to pay someone to work out.

Edit: Since there is some confusion based on the comments. I would like to emphasize that the $300-$500 would be additional cash sent to them without obligation of repayment - not as amounts applied towards wiping their $3000 debt.

Edit 2: The ""workout"" for the agreement was defined to be 300 active calories on her apple watch during the day. I based this off my own workouts where I usually average 400-500 in 60 minutes.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

>!I really appreciate everyone who took the time to provide input into this thread. I've read a lot of varying opinions on the topic and was able to see things clearer from her and my perspective. The takeaway I got from this is that there are a lot of people out there who would appreciate the offer as well as others who would have their feelings hurt and the sad reality confirmed to me is that my friends and my views on the issue (as well as many other things between us) are significantly incompatible. I don't see this person being in my life much longer.!<

>!To all the people who accused me of being controlling, manipulative, abusive, or went through my post history to make a moral judgement about me as a person, you're free to think as you wish, however, until you lived through my experience dating a person with BPD, I'm going to trust my own opinion over yours on the topic. Control isn't inherently bad - it's how it's used. However, you're absolutely right that this person and I should not be in contact. That responsibility is mine to handle and I will. !<",1
"My friend has been married for a year now to her firefighter husband. She is the only on in the friend group that is married. I usually host dinners every couple of months and we are going to do a late one for the holidays on Friday. 

I usually invite him but money has gotten tight due to the holidays and he eats so much. I understand why but it always results in my having to double recipes or I run out of food. So this time I told everyone that I want to just do a girls night. This means my friends husband is not invited. If he isn’t there that their is enough food for everyone without double recipes

She called me up asking why I am doing a girls night, I told her the truth that I can’t afford to make double for dinner and her husband eats a lot. She called me a jag off and now she is telling my friends why. Everyone is split and no one is offering to help with the food bill.

Edit: I will give the group the option to Venmo me some money or change it to a potluck. Never mind I will be canceling it

I’ll get off Reddit so last response ",1
"I (21 M) have this cousin, “Taylor” (20F). She is really Christian and she’s considers herself an “anti-abortion activist.” I don’t really care about political stuff, but she’s rude to me all the time because I’m not Christian and so we have some bad blood. 

This summer, I’ve had to see her every week when I go to my grandma’s to help her take out her trash cans and other household stuff (Taylor lives with my grandma). Taylor told me that she is planning to go to law school, and that she wants to try to make abortion illegal for her career. She isn’t a good student — she hadn’t even heard of the LSAT before I told her — and she doesn’t have a solid plan for how she’s going to “make abortion illegal.” 

I told her it was a dumbass idea, and she should stay in the Major she’s currently in (nursing). She started crying and wouldn’t talk to me for the rest of the time I was at my grandma’s. My grandma was also mad, and she said I was pushing my godless agenda on Taylor. She said that next time I came over, she would invite her minister to drop by and talk to me about it. I don’t want to see her minister, and I told her I would leave and stop helping her if she did that. 

AITA? Was I too mean to my cousin?",1
"I (23F) am a fine arts student currently taking a drawing course. I’m passing the class with flying colors, I love it. My professor has been great, but I’m unsure if my request for accommodation will come across as ridiculous. 

My assignment is to submit three separate drawings of my own hands in different poses. I’m confident in my ability to complete the assignment, but that isn’t really the issue. 

I am a chronic nail biter to an extreme. My fingertips are irreparably scarred, and my nail beds are short and misshapen. I have tried many times to stop biting my nails, but I have been doing it my entire life. 

I am incredibly insecure about the state of my hands, and the thought of spending several days drawing every detail of them makes me want to cry. I want to ask my professor if he would allow me to use someone else’s hands as a reference. 

However, I’m torn. I don’t want to come across as a stereotypical gen-z who is ‘triggered’ by life and refuses to step even an inch outside of their comfort zone. I don’t want to be coddled or pitied. But I don’t know if I can do this assignment with enjoyment or passion if I have to draw my own hands. 

So, would I be the asshole for asking for special treatment on this assignment? 

TL;DR My teacher wants me to draw my hands thrice. My hands would make Freddy Krueger shit himself. Would I be ridiculous asking if I can draw literally anyone else’s hands?

UPDATE: The verdict was in, and I would’ve been the asshole. So, rather than chickening out, I stuck through it and received a 100% on my assignment. Thank you guys for the empathy, the tough love, and everything else. I can’t say whether or not I love my hands more than I did, but I’m glad that I listened to the advice and just did the work. I came out a better student for it. ",1
"My (F17) cousin, Jack (M17), is a typical high school jock. He's a nice guy who gets along with everyone, but, not gonna lie (ngl), he does sometimes try too hard to look tough or cool. Nonetheless, he is probably one of the most popular kids at our school and gets along with almost everyone. My mom is his mom's younger sister, and we've been neighbours since we were kids.

Despite Jack having a reputation as one of the ""cool kids"" at school, he has a pretty funny secret. The secret is that he loves old BBC period dramas. It's honestly hilarious seeing this man get excited in the summer or over the winter break when he watches them with his mom (my aunt), my mom, and my two older sisters (F21) and (F23). So anyway, this past week, Jack didn't come to school on Thursday since he got a muscle cramp from playing soccer for the school team on Wednesday night and decided to rest at home.

We're in the same homeroom English class, so when some of my friends asked me where he was, I said something along the lines of how he was probably catching up on his old period dramas. Ngl, everyone looked over at me in the class, even our teacher. I repeated what I said and told them how he loves them more than anything and has binge-watched so many series. Everyone was laughing at this stage, and our teacher was like ""probably explains why he writes so well"". I didn't think it was a big deal at the time. Throughout the day, word spread pretty quickly of this and over the lunch my friends and I were approached by some of Jack’s friends who were pretty eager to hear more lol.

So on Friday, Jack walked into class, and one of my friends asked him if he really did watch old British dramas. He just looked at me, shocked, and asked if I had said anything. I didn't think it was too serious, so I just laughed and said that I only told the truth. He just sighed and made the flat facial expression he always makes when he’s pretending I’m annoying him. I thought he was still joking around, so I apologized in an exaggerated British accent and hugged him, but he didn't even react and only said that I was “awful”.

I know there have been a few jokes about him liking the dramas throughout Friday, but he's got tough skin and has never held a grudge, so I didn't think he'd mind. 

But I have noticed he's been distant from me since yesterday morning in our English class, and we have not spoken since then. Some of my friends think I was an asshole?",1
"This is a simple story. Earlier today I sent an invite link to a group because I am offering a teaching service. 

Well right now (1:52 AM) I was going through the whole group chat to see who said yes and who said no, because I am writing the yes’s on excel to keep track. The yes’s are people who said they are interested to join in the future as this is not a commitment for right now or for at all. Just to show me interest. 

Well, I noticed one lady joined the link but didn’t tell me anything. So to make sure, I sent her a simple text “Hi! I noticed that you joined the group. Would you like me to sign you up?” 

She immediately replied saying “it is 2 AM, I work tomorrow” and an angry face emoji, which angered me a bit because she could’ve 1. Not replied 2. Not replied until the morning 3. Just replied yes or no. 

So I texted her back “then put your phone on silence? Suggestion. Bye.”

She replied:
 “if you want and if you like your job learn to do it well”

“these are not hours not everyone has your time”
 
EDIT: 
After, I replied that what I am doing is not my job and that I am only doing it to help people get that service for extremely cheap. 

She then said “I can’t have my phone on silent because I have a difficult home situation and I don’t have to give you explanations” 

And “I know, that’s why I signed up since the afternoon” 

Which she didn’t sign up, she only joined. 

I told her I won’t send another message but that I expect her to not send anything either. 

She replied “have a good dawn.” 

And that’s that. 

So AITA?",1
"Hello, I made a throwaway account for more anonymity. My mom (67F) recently got into a car accident driving home from my sister's apartment and I'm blaming my sister for it. My sister (38F) has a 10-month old baby. She had the baby because she was getting older and didn't want to lose her chance at being a mother. The father is her former friends-with-benefits who agreed to have a baby with her but stated he wouldn't be emotionally or financially active in the baby's life. He already has a son he's not involved with. My sister said she didn't care who the baby is with and if the father is in the baby's life, she just wanted a baby to raise. She said she can do it all by herself but it became obvious that she severely underestimated how hard it would be. Not only is she a single mother to a newborn, she also has a full-time job and is struggling financially. 

My mother has been co-raising the baby. She drives over 2 hours away every few days to take care of the baby so my sister can rest. She has also been giving my sister money every month. My mom has expressed to me several times that she feels like she was forced into this role and she can't turn her back on my sister while she's struggling. My mom still works full-time and she was supposed to retire soon but now it's all up in the air. She had plans to travel the world and now she has to post-pone her retirement plans because she feels obligated to help co-parent my sister's baby. 

My mom is a decent driver and doesn't usually get into accidents. However, she has gotten into 6 minor car accidents since the baby was born because she's tired from babysitting and my sister lives so far away. My mom is an older woman and she gets tired more easily. She shouldn't be exerting herself so hard and I tell my mom that but she doesn't listen and of course my sister doesn't say anything to her. My sister also refuses to move back home even though it would save money and relieve some stress from our mom.

Last week, my mom got into a big car accident... her car flipped over and she's been in the hospital since then. She broke her back and has a bad concussion, she has trouble remembering short term things now. I don't know what my mom's life will look like once she gets discharged from the hospital. Yesterday, I blew up on my sister and told her it's her fault that our mom is like this. I told her if she wasn't so selfish, considered the people around her and made better choices this could have been prevented. I'm just so upset. I feel like my mom deserved to live her retirement in peace and my sister stole that from her. My sister started crying and my aunt/uncle told me I was wrong for this. AITA?",1
"I’ve only used this platform once but the last time I used it I got pretty good advice, so I decided to share another issue I have on here.

I have a great friend group of about nine people. But over the summer, I was cut off by all of them because some of them decided that I was not a good influence. This was partly because of my actions, but also because one of my ex friends talking to someone in the group, Emily and spreading misinformation. I was in a bad mental state over the summer, so that’s why I might’ve done some sort of actions but overall the reason I was kicked out was because of misinformation. During that time that I was out a new person was added we will call him Ryan, he was part of a small group that was inside the larger group, so the group chat decided to add him. Ryan wasn’t always the nicest person he had multiple accusations of him hurting people. This wasn’t always purposeful, because he doesn’t really know his own strength also because half of the group is girls. After I was added back, Ryan had expressed not verbally but through his actions that I shouldn’t have been added back. He multiple times called me stupid bad and had said things like “if you join this call, it would ruin it” and “why are you here.” One time in my opinion, he crossed the line. He texted himself and did some sort of shenanigans to make it look like I was texting him talking bad about one person in the friend group. That person was also added the same time that I was added, so I didn’t really know her that well she’s a great person and I really would never say anything to be mean to her. She’s one of the nicest people I know. So I decided to retaliate and make a fake text just to show that he could’ve lied about it and that it wasn’t true. So I sent it and my friends were like” oh my God you’re lying you’re totally lying” and then I said that wasn’t the point I was just gonna show you that Ryan lied to you all. So now I decided to not join the calls when he’s on them and things like that because he doesn’t make me feel feel good about myself. So was I the asshole for retaliating against Ryan?",1
"For the past two months my friend has been constantly claiming her boyfriend says / does nasty stuff to her. (To the point where I would consider abusive) 

When we ask her why she stays with him, she gives us a whole lotta reasons, can’t list all of them but basically all excuses. I will only include this one as I think this might be a related info, he had a severe - complex mental health disorder in the past. Then he started medication / treatment and gotten better. (As in he’s been managing to control symptoms / live - function normally , otherwise it’s not something you can totally cure from what I know.) She believes he’s relapsing. I personally don’t think that’s what’s happening as he’s still on meds and I don’t think you can just suddenly relapse like that when you are still on meds. Even if that’s case it still doesn’t excuse his (claimed) constant abusive behavior imho. The disorder is called schizoaffective, in case you want to look into it. 

Now back to main topic, I personally think some of the stuff she claims that happened is maybe true but respectfully, I don’t buy all of it. Each day something new happens, all of which ends up with her being so understanding and saving the day basically, at this point i think she makes up at the least some of them to gain sympathy from us. The worst part is we can’t do anything about this, when we ask her if she want us to talk with him she “certainly refuses” that idea and says it will only make everything worse, and she just wants to vent sometimes but can handle everything well on her own / doesn’t look for our help. 

We have talked with other friends and decided to finally confront him on the on-going issue. I accepted being the one confronting him. I think this is best option for both my friend’s and his sake, either he is abusive and needs to be confronted because we can’t let her keep coddling him and accepting the abuse or she’s lying and blaming him wrongfully in which case he has a right to know. Obviously confronting him means going against my friend’s will. Other friends are encouraging me to do so however I have this fear of being the AH and bad friend in the end, so I wanna ask others before it becomes too late for me to step back. WIBTA if I go on with the plan and confront him?

Info regarding our relationships: We are all mutual friends thorough high school. We are currently in college and mostly in contact with her. So that’s why we usually only hear things from her side. We aren’t that close with the guy anymore, only exchanging some small talk here and there but he distanced himself from the rest of the friend group basically.",1
"My wife and I got married last summer. I have a son (14) and a daughter (12) with my ex-wife and my wife has a son (7) with her ex-husband. We all moved in together in late 2021. My kids get along great with their stepbrother and they adore me wife. I have had a trickier time bonding with my stepson. We have my kids every other week and my stepson goes to his dads every other weekend. 

My stepson is a massive daddy's boy. His dad takes him on some kind of ""adventure"" every weekend they're together. He is always talking about what he is going to do with his dad or what he and his dad did at the weekend. Which is annoying but fine. However, recently he keeps comparing me to his dad. Saying things his dad would do differently or telling me his dad can do something so I should be able to too. 

Last weekend we went camping, which is something we've not really done before as a family. When it came to building a campfire my stepson started complaining I was doing it wrong (I was following a YouTube tutorial) and tried to interfer with what I was doing. Then he said ""how are you a man but don't even know how to make a fire"" before going on to talk about how his dad could light a fire with a stick. I was already stressed about the whole weekend and I ended up snapping at him and telling to shut up about his dad. 

Obviously, I was in the wrong for snapping. After finishing the fire I went to apologies to him and let him know I was in the wrong for talking to him like that. I did however, reaffirm that I would like it if he stopped talking about his dad so much. 

Later in the week he must of said something to my wife about not being allowed to mention his dad. She is now mad at me for having this discussion with him even though I know she finds it annoying as well. In truth I have always felt self conscious about my wife's ex-husband as he is very stereotypically masculine guy (ex-marine) and I'm the opposite. My wife's sister called me an ""over correction"" to my face a few months into dating. It's also frustrating to see how much my stepson idolises his dad when he doesn't know how much his dad hurt his mom. He cheated on her, was abusive, and continued to financially abuse her post separation. His dad has refused to have any more custody time with his son and even when we went on our honeymoon last year he sent his son to his moms rather than look after him himself. I know how much it hurts my wife to see her son favor his dad when he does the bare minimum as a father and damaged her so badly. AITA for suggesting he stops talking about his dad so much?",1
"I (M22) am a substitute teacher. In my district we're paid the legal minimum for the job. If you work more than 15 days at a school you get ""normal"" pay - I only ever get jobs that are exactly 15 days. A few days into my placement, I heard some teachers (both M30ish) in the lounge complaining that bus monitors only get paid $20 an hour, and laughing about how only an idiot would do a job for that little. I make $14.50. I jumped in and told them, they didn't know I was being paid that little.

My monthly grocery budget is $150. An entire paycheck has to go to rent alone, and then the majority of the rest goes to medical expenses (I am permanently disabled), other bills, and gas. I usually have less than $10 total for a few days before my next paycheck. I don't qualify for SNAP. My disabilities make most food pantry items inaccessible (I have anaphylaxis from nuts, honey, peppers, and more). For the past month, thanks to a prescription going up in price, I have been eating once every 24 hours to keep making rent, but for the last 8 months I've been food insecure. I usually cry on the way home because I pass by fast food and know I can't even get a hamburger. I'm almost always so hungry it hurts.

I admit I've got some resentment to my job for paying me so little while the school constantly complains that we don't have enough subs. I've had anger building up over the fact that I'm starving, and they only hire me for the maximum days before they have to pay me more.

Where I might be the asshole:

I've started being open about the fact that I'm hungry at work. I never ask for food – just stuff like they'll ask if I can keep a student in the room over lunch, and I'll be chipper/my usual self and reply ""of course, I'll just be reading, I couldn't afford food today."" A teacher I don't know will ask what I packed for lunch and I'll say ""nothing, I can't afford that much food."" Stuff like that. It's always true. I'm careful to not exaggerate.

Recently I was in the library and the librarian asked if I had dinner plans. I said no, I have to skip eating today because I can't afford it. She looked at me weird and said while she won't judge me for being unable to eat, it's very unprofessional to talk about it at work where you're being paid. I told her if it's unprofessional for me to talk about starving it's just as unprofessional to pay me so little I starve. She went quiet and we didn't really talk for the rest of the day.

She got me thinking and I'll admit I don't know if I'm actually being an asshole. I know other staff aren't the ones who pay me so little. But I also feel like my struggle is invisible, and after full time teachers called anyone taking even $20 an hour an idiot, it's really been eating at me (ha).

TL;DR I'm being open about the fact that I'm food insecure at work, and don't feel bad for making the people paid more than me feel awkward. I was told it was unprofessional and snapped back.",1
"My wife and I had our first child 3 months ago.  My sister lives 2 hours away and has seen my daughter once.  The wife, kid, and I made plans to travel the 2 hours to visit my sister.  I thought this would be a good opportunity for my sister to visit with my daughter and we'd go out to eat somewhere.

My sister has 3 dogs who are her world and have free reign at her place, much to my chagrin at times. They are allowed on the couch, in the kitchen, everywhere. I've visited her and not sat on the couch because I don't want dog hair on me.  We've had family vacations where she brought her dogs.  Everything had to be dog friendly or centric and I did not enjoy that trip.  I've passed on future vacations. There was no point in trying to talk her out of bringing them plus I don't want to spend my vacation with her dogs.

When we arrived I knock, hear the barking, and tell my wife to hold off bringing my daughter inside until I know the dogs are in another room.  Sister opens the door, greets me, and says come inside.  I ask do you mind putting the dogs in another room.  She pauses, goes absolutely not, and looks baffled i'd even request that.  I told her that i'm not ready for my daughter to be around 3 dogs. It's only for about an hour then we are going to lunch.

After a bit of back and forth it's obvious she won't put the dogs away. I just say, alright, i'm going to head home.  I help my wife put my daughter in the car and start to leave.  The whole time my sister is flipping out, saying WTF, she says she didn't even get to see her niece, says I'm an asshole, etc.  So after 5 minutes at my sisters house we drove the 2 hours back home.  I had 2 dozen texts and phone calls from her that I didn't acknowledge.  So was I the asshole in this situation?

Edit: A few things.

The reason we drove to visit my sister is because she expressed us wanting to come out.  She suggested I come to her place.

I thought it was no issue to put the dogs in another room for an hour.  Its not like we were staying for days on end, it was a day trip.

I don't want my kid around dogs right now, when she is older and after I can teach her properly how to interact with them she is.  This isn't about allergies.

The dogs behave fine, but to my knowledge they have never been around babies/children.

My wife was not happy, but she supports the no dogs around our baby rule.

I'd rather be safe than sorry with our daughter.",1
"

**situation**


I (M34) recently bought a one-story house. Note that it was purchased solely by me, my wife did not help save for it (I started saving for it before I even met here) and it's in my name.


When my parents threw us a party for this happy ocassion, mom asked for a copy of the key in case of an emergency. I let her have it which made my wife upset. She didn't say anything at the time but she waited til we were alone and started arguing with me saying I shouldn't have let my mother have a copy of the key. I said ""why?!"" Since my mother is known to respect privacy and is a very trusted member in the family. She said that she does not feel ""comfortable"" with the idea of someone else, who's not a resident to have a copy of the key. She also brought up how my mother didn't pay a penny towards the house so this should ""disqualify her"" from getting the key. I said it was not a big deal but she kept presisting saying I need to take the key back. Quite frankly, this had me fuming. I pointed out that I'm the one who bought the house and it's my decision to decide who gets to have a copy of the key end of story. She screamed at me saying that ""technically"" she did contribute towards the house savings back when she used to pay for our rent and daily expenses while I saved money. I told her that she was acting as if I put my mom's name on the title which's ridiculous but she said that I have no respect for her opiniins and keep undermining her input.


We've been going back and forth on it since then. She's now ""letting me know"" that if I don't take the key back then she'll do it herself. I think she's being irrational and unreasonable acting like that over a copy of the house key. This decision I made could save us in case of an emergency but she kept downplaying it.


E.T.A I think it's crucial to mention that there's no conflict between my mother and my wife. They're on near perfect terms, alright? I thought that I've already established that above.",1
"I (36F) am currently going through a divorce with my ex (35M ""Dick"" 😉.) Dick is a narcissist and I  overlooked a lot of red flags. The biggest one of these was that he cheated on me in 2016 with his cousin's (Liam) recent ex gf (Lilith). They had an affair for 9 months. I don't know how much happened and I doubt he told me the whole truth, nor do I need it, but I am concerned about Liam. 

Dick and Liam are not just cousins but best friends. Liam was very much in love with Lilith and it was his first serious relationship. Eventually Lilith broke up with him and he was devastated. He had very poor mental health, was drinking heavily, sharing very dark thoughts, and more. Everyone that knew him was very worried about him. 

Lilith was brought into our friend group when she was dating Liam, but she stuck around after they broke up and grew closer to Dick. I never expected him to cheat, but I ended up finding out during a fallout with a friend who knew and used it to hurt me. So not only did I lose a close friend, but this info made me feel like I could trust no one. I ended up in a very dark place myself. 

I ended up forgiving him (a big mistake I KNOW!), but he begged me not to tell Liam because he was worried about his mental health getting worse. This was a valid concern and as much as I hated it, I kept this shitty secret. Now, years later, I keep thinking about Liam. They are still best friends. Unfortunately Liam's life hasn't gotten any easier. One of his parents was diagnosed with an aggressive form of dementia, and their grandmother passed away recently. I don't know if Liam has gotten any therapy or help for his depression but it seems doubtful. 

I hated finding out other people knew Dick had betrayed me but didn't say a word until it was used to hurt me. I really worry for Liam, but I am equally concerned that telling him will leave him feeling more alone when he needs support the most. But I know it's fucked up that he's getting support from someone who is so willing to betray him, repeatedly (this is not the first time Dick went after one of Liam's GFs or exes). I admit hurting my ex would be a bit of justice for me, but that isn't my motive. I simply want to protect Liam from getting hurt by Dick even more. 

Early in the divorce process, I opened up to a few friends about Dick being abusive to me and it blew up in my face. Considering how much that backfired on me, I'm hesitant to say anything to Liam. We aren't close, and this information will likely deeply hurt him or not be believed. I don't even know if Liam would care about the stuff with Lilith anymore anyway since it's been years now and they never got together again. 

So AITA if I don't tell Liam about Dick's betrayal? Or should I just stay out of it?

*ETA more info on the interpersonal conflict: My ex obviously still does NOT want me to tell Liam. I am also still close to my MIL who has known this the whole time and stayed silent for the same reasons. Her family is already experiencing a lot of grief for multiple unrelated reasons and I worry I will hurt my relationship with her further and put more stress on her during an already difficult time by revealing this information that would fracture her family even more.*",1
"I(28M) got engaged to my girlfriend(27F) 3 months ago and we are planning our wedding. Now we know how many of our friends we can invite and we have started making our initial list. One of my close friends is right now in a relationship with a woman that I dated for 2 years. Our lives were going into different directions, I wanted to have kids she doesn’t, and we determined we needed to break up. It was amicable, we are still on good terms, I don’t really talk to her all that much unless it’s through my friend.

I’m inviting my friend and there’s no doubt about it. I have no reason to not give him a plus one and he’s obviously gonna bring his girlfriend. When I said this my fiancée said she didn’t want her at her wedding. At first I tried to be accommodating. I explained the situation to my friend, he said he wouldn’t feel comfortable going without her as she’d feel bad. I really want my friend to go, and I told my fiancée that we needed to let her come.

She said she doesn’t want some woman that I used to fuck there at her wedding. I told her that if she was feeling jealous, that she won. Like literally she won the shitty prize that is to marry me, and all I want is for my friend to be there. We argued about this back and forth, eventually she in an accusing way asked why I wanted her at our wedding so bad, I told her that I already explained that it’s not about her it’s about my friend and that she obviously wasn’t listening. 

We hit an impasse and moved on. She’s still mad at me about it and I’m still upset with her about it.

AITA?",1
"


I f25 along with my two brothers Dean & Kevin (both 30s) went through rough time during our parents divorce, mom got married to my stepdad and we lived with him for years. Dean and Kevin never had a good relationship because they never wanted my mom and dad to separate in the first place, they resented my stepdad and limitied contact once they moved out. I, on the other hand got to live with my stepdad more since I'm the youngest and we established a somewhat stable relationship. Ngl he did what he could to help me out with school and everything, he even offered to fund my wedding which is going to be in 5 weeks time and I'm very grateful for that though this was his decision.

I sent Dean and Kevin invitations but once they found out that our stepdad was going to be there, they said they might not come. They took time to think then gave me an ultinatum stating that if our stepdad is coming then they won't be. I literally freaked out because I definately want my brothers to be at my wedding so badly and I tried talking to them but they were being stubborn, after talking to my fiance I had no choice but to politely uninvite my stepdad and sending him an email stating why. He said that he didn't reply but later I got a call from my mom yelling at me calling me hurtful stuff saying I was acting like an ungrateful b by excluding her husband from the wedding after everything he's done for me, I told her that my brothers threatened not to come which pushed me to make this difficult dicision because if it was for me I'd have everyone there. She cussed me out for prioritizing my hateful and cold hearted brothers over my stepdad and showing him that I'm not worthy of his grace which was really really hurtful for me to hear. After she hung up I asked my fiance if I made the wrong decision and je said it's my wedding and I get to decide eventually but I knew he said that because he's biased.",1
"My evil step mother is coming to where we live (approximately a 5 hour drive) to see MY daughter and granddaughter, but she refuses to have anything to do with my son in law.

She says she is concerned because MY daughter is on disability and her husband (common law husband) isn't working due to personal reasons. She is worried about MY daughter and granddaughters welfare because he isn't working. 

For context my step mother has always been abusive towards me and my kids, going so far as to lie to child services about me. She is a narcissist and loves to play the victim, when she is the one gaslighting everyone who doesn't agree with her. 

She wants to take just my daughter and granddaughter out for dinner, but refuses to invite my son in law too.

So would I be an asshole for telling my step mother that my daughter, granddaughter and son in law are a package deal and if she can't accept that, then she is NOT allowed near our home?

MY daughter is worried about standing up to this narcissist because she feels that she would be made to look like a bully to the narcissist.

I capitalized the ""my"" because the narcissist is claiming she is my daughter's mom, when all she did was lie to cps about me and got custody of my daughter through her lies.  Two years after she got custody, she adopted my daughter against my daughters wishes.

Edited to add: MY daughter is on the autism spectrum as am I, but we are both high functioning and it kills me to see her upset due to her wishes and boundaries not being respected.

Update:

The step monster from hell showed up but would not come inside because she wanted to avoid conflict according to my daughter and I assured her there would be no conflict.

As everyone was outside and I  was asked to go out,  I did so and even was polite to her (step monster that is) and told her she looked good but she ignored me and my son who came with her apologized for her not acknowledging that I gave her a compliment. 

My daughter told her that her, her husband and daughter are a package deal, so she decided not to take them for dinner.

Step monster says she will not return to our town, as ""there is nothing to do here,"" yet if you know where to go and what events are happening, there is a lot to do here.

For those saying I am the ahole, I took the advice of someone here that messaged me and stayed out of it but assured my daughter that if she needed me to say something or even just be there for her after, I would.",1
"Throwaway because I’m already getting some shit for this and don’t need it on my main.

So everyone in my life it feels like is getting married or having babies or whatever. Im in my early 30’s so I get it, but it’s getting obnoxious. For the most part I just keep my opinion to myself but my close friends know I’m militantly child-free so my not giving a flying monkey about their babies shouldn’t be a surprise.

Anyways onto the issue, my closest friend got pregnant in the summer and I was devastated.  I kind of thought she was in the same boat as me but obviously not. I’ll admit I reacted a bit poorly when she told me but it was literally months ago. I noticed yesterday we hadn’t talked or hung out in like 4 months (not extremely unusual cuz we both get busy) so I asked her if we could go to a restaurant and catch up. 

She said she was dealing with some major health stuff right now so she isn’t going out at the moment, cool I understand that, so I asked if maybe I could come over for tea or something and she was super dismissive like “It’s not going to be the best time for me for awhile.” So I straight up just asked her if something was up. 

She told me she didn’t really want to hang out right now because she knows I don’t want to hear about any baby stuff. I told her to just talk about other stuff. Like it shouldn’t be that hard. She’s still a person outside of being a spawn incubator right? 

We argued a bit and she pretty much told me she isn’t in the physical or mental headspace to tiptoe around the fact she’s pregnant with me which I literally never asked her to do and she brought up again me mentioning abort**** (mostly jokingly and in reference to me - I was like “Oh geez I’d already be at an abort*** clinic”) months ago and said she just couldn’t handle the “negativity” right now. 

I told her she wasn’t doing anyone favours turning into a mommybot and to hit me up when she has a personality again which yeah was maybe a bit harsh but she literally was saying to me we couldn’t hang out because she couldn’t not talk about being pregnant, it seems harsh, but her own words pretty much.

I vented to some of our mutual friends about it and the reactions are split. Some say she’s overreacting and some have talked to her recently and not had it not be about pregnancy anyways so they don’t get her reasoning  and others say I’m a huge asshole because she’s having major complications so it’s probably hard to just “turn off.” Arguably though today was the first I’d heard of any complications so how would I have known? AITA for being sick of this?

ETA: Alright everyone I get it. I’m the asshole. I feel like if I worded this differently and took out some of my jokes it wouldn’t have the Reddit mob so heated lmao but I accept my judgement. 

I’m probably just going to let the friendship fizzle. I stand by what I said that if someone had strong religious or political views and asked me not to talk religion or politics etc I wouldn’t and I don’t see why it’s so different for kids but obviously that’s why I should probably just stick to child-free friends lmao.

Thanks to the people who’ve DMed me NTA judgements and get where I’m coming from, I understand why you don’t want to leave them on the post but thank you anyways!",1
"Earlier this year I gifted my girlfriend (33F) tickets to a concert that she really wanted to go to that was this past Friday night. I'm (36M) not a fan of her music, nor the fact that this concert was in the city, but I wanted to make it a great gift. She was elated when I told her that I bought the VIP package (meet and greet, pictures with the band, etc.).

Last week my girlfriend began asking if we had to get to the venue early. Being the thorough, detailed person that she is, I assured her I would check. Instead, I was too busy with work. Honestly it was getting a bit annoying that almost every few days she would ask, so I told her I didn't see anything while deleting a bunch of emails from the venue for concerts I don't even care about. On Friday afternoon, she told me that she had tried looking things up and was only finding that the doors opened at 7. With that, I picked her up at 6 and arrived at the venue for 7.

Once inside, she showed security our tickets and asked about for the meet and greet. The bouncer informed us that the VIP was at 6:00. I froze, now my girlfriend turns to me asking if I received any kind of emails (the tickets were in my name). I told her that I deleted emails and she seemed to understand. I actually really enjoyed the whole time, so once her band's set ended, we decided to not stay for the last band. And this is where the trouble began.

It's 10PM, we're outside of the venue, and she suggests we go to a bar a block away and either walk or rideshare. Immediately I said there was not a chance. She mentioned that my car was in a secured lot and we wouldn't be far, but I lost my cool, which I admit was NOT the best way to go about things, and told her, ""You don't **go out** in the city. There is crime all over the place!"" She responded that we were in the city. I went off how I can't stand it here, so she said that we'll just leave. No raising of her voice, she just said she was fine with leaving. She was silent on the way back and I suggest that we go back to my place to finish out the night and she refused. This also pissed me off because I asked what was wrong with the bar next to my apartment and she shut that down with her short responses.

Overall, the night cost me over $300, and while she is saying more to me now as opposed to Friday night, she is being very distant. She told me she could live with not going to the meet and greet except for how things turned out afterwards and that is when the disappointment truly set in. My response was that I was only bringing her to the concert, nowhere else, and thinking of her safety. She continued that I shouldn't have bought the tickets if I was only ""tolerating doing so"".

I do accept that I made some mistakes, chiefly with making us miss the meet and greet. The timing of the concert should have made this an unforgettable experience since her grandmother just died. Am I the asshole?",1
"I (32M) am expecting my second child with my (30F) wife. My wife is 14 weeks pregnant, and we are really excited! My sister (25F) and her wife (27F) are also pregnant with their first child. My sister and her wife did IVF, and my sister is 38 weeks pregnant. I’m very happy for them, and I think they will make great parents. 

The other day we all met up to see our grandparents. They live out of state and don’t visit a lot, so when they do we always set aside time to see them all together. My grandparents were talking about how excited they were to see my sister and her wife become mothers, and they couldn’t wait to have their first great granddaughter. They continued to talk about my sister’s baby and didn’t even acknowledge my wife’s pregnancy. I could tell it was hurting my wife, so I tried to start a conversation to include her but it always went back to my sister and my SIL’s baby. I even tried talking about the gender reveal we are holding soon, but no one seemed to care. My wife got upset and walked out of the room. My sister asked me if everything was okay, and I told her that my wife was upset because she’s feeling left out. My SIL apologized and said that that wasn’t her intention. My mom tried to convince my wife to come back and sit down, but she refused. My sister told me that my wife cant expect every conversation to be about her, and “this isn’t a competition.” I told my sister that her baby isn’t the only baby that matters and ours matters too. My grandma told me that she would be more than happy to discuss both pregnancies, but it was too late. My wife wanted to leave, so that’s what we did. 

I’m now being called an asshole by my parents for making a scene with my grandparents there. I feel like no one cares enough to see my wife and I’s side in this. 

AITA here?",1
"I am 8 weeks pregnant and have had really bad nausea and vomiting for the past 2 weeks of my pregnancy. It's been totally disruptive to my life and I feel miserable. This comes during my husband's busy period at work, where he is working 80+ hours a week.

The last few days I've been keeping large bowls on hand to puke in while I try to work from the couch. My husband asked me why I don't just use the toilet, and I told him that our toilet is disgustingly dirty, because...I've been sick for two weeks so no one has cleaned it. Getting that close to the toilet while nauseas makes me feel even worse. Hence, the bowls. And moving fast upsets my stomach even more. So when nausea hits, it's nice to not have to sprint to the next room.

I'm struggling to make it through each day, and when my husband gets home in the evening between 7-8pm I hope for a little relief or help with some food. Today he said that because I admitted to using bowls for ""comfort,"" rather than throwing up in the toilet, he won't help me clean them.

I know it's gross, and I have been doing most of this myself. AITA for wanting occasional help with my pregnancy puke clean up?",1
"My boyfriend is obese and diabetic. His doctor ordered him to change his diet and the only thing he actually changed was to wheat bread instead of white for his daily turkey sandwich and sweet n' low instead of sugar in tea. Which he drinks about 4 glasses of a day. That's it, he still eats burgers, fries, chicken nuggets, tacos, potatoes. And sweets. Lotsa sweets. He has some diet meals (Healthy Choice dinners) but gives into cravings a lot for the bad stuff, so they go unopened. 

But it's his choice, so i don't say much. He was out of wheat bread, so i'd pick some up while i was out. But since it was raining, i opted not to go at all. He didn't mind, but lunch time. He was looking for something to eat but there was no wheat bread. He couldn't find anything healthy, so i told him to just buckle down and eat the white bread for one day. He said something about cutting back. But i told him it's no different then the other junk food he eats.

And he got mad. He kinda grumbled at me how ""It's something he can feel good about that he cut back."" I told him maybe he should cut back on the cookies and tacos. He said the same thing about being proud and shouted he's ""TRYING TO CUT BACK!"" and i said ""Oh, you can't eat White bread. But you can scarf down burgers and baked potatoes and tacos, etc."" (I listed off all the bad food he's not supposed to eat, but does.) and he just shouted at me, he told me to shut up. But i continued and kept telling him the bad food he's not supposed to have ""I'm just saying, you still eat pizza and chips and pies""

He said he's doing his best and it's not easy. I told him ""I know about the oreos in your sock drawer. You aren't trying that hard."" and that one thing won't make a difference when he's eating all kinds of other junk.",1
"Let me be clear I am over the moon my wife is pregnant and we are having a baby. Like really really excited. However I am just not that into discussing the intricacies of strollers, car seats and cribs yet. Like I really just don’t care at this moment as I’ve got a lot else going on. Plus we will be moving before the baby arrives and I look at it all as just more stuff I’m going to have to move around. 

So today, my first day off in a while, I was going to some errands for myself. Wife wanted to join to get out of the house - no problem. After popping into a few stores she wants to go check out some cribs & car seats - no problem. So she’s looking at them in the store and I’m following her around, texting friends on my phone while she looks. 

After a while she accuses me of not being into it, and tbh I’m really just not into the whole shopping thing and I could care less what type of crib/bassinet/car seat/stroller we get as long as it’s safe. Apparently this is a problem and my day off just went sour. 

Am I the asshole for not really being that into this stuff at this point? Is it standard practice to accumulate all this stuff so far in advance? Are most husbands that into talking about this crap for hours? 

AITA?",1
"I’m (M43) a single dad to two twin daughters (F18), Jess and Amy (not their real names). Their mum hasn’t been in their lives since they were about 6 and as a result, we’re a close family and the girls have an extremely tight bond.

They couldn’t be any different as people though. Jess is a big extrovert; she loves to party, is out every weekend, has a boyfriend and a big circle of friend. Amy, on the other hand, is introverted, shy, and spends most of her time studying or reading. They still remain really close and I hope that Jess brings Amy out of her shell more and Amy encourages Jess to study more than she currently does.

Last weekend, Jess had been invited to a party with a group of friends. Amy hadn’t been and I suggested to Jess letting Amy come as well; I thought it would be good for her to socialise after working hard throughout the week. Jess mentioned it to Amy and when Amy asked me, I told her she should go.

They both got ready that evening, Jess picked out Amy’s outfit, and it was great to see some sisterly bonding.

At around 2am, I hear a big thud downstairs which woke me up. Jess was carrying Amy, who was clearly very, very drunk. When I asked what happened, Jess told me that Amy had gotten carried away drinking and as she’s not used to alcohol at all, it had a bad effect on her. Jess told me Amy was talking to everyone, flirting with boys, took her top off to expose her bra, drinking shots, and essentially nothing like her character. Jess took her away at 2am to come home.

While Amy was vomiting in the toilet, I got annoyed at Jess for allowing her to get in that state as she knows Amy doesn’t drink and Jess had a responsibility to look out for her when she’s on her own. Jess said Amy’s an adult and she can do what she likes, which got me extremely irate and I shouted at Jess as I knew Amy would not have been in that state if Jess wasn’t encouraging her to drink/party.

Amy has been extremely embarrassed (as well as hungover) since and has said she’s never planning to socialise with Jess or at school again. I’ve told Jess I’m disappointed in her for allowing this, which she said is completely unfair. Now she’s being distant with both me and Amy.

Part of me feels this is justified as I know Jess would have had an influence on Amy, while the other part of me does know she’s an adult who should make her own choices.

So, AITA?

(Note that we’re in the UK where the legal drinking age is 18).",1
"Christmas is going to be terrible.  It seems very likely that I’m going to be fired from my job when I go back, for what was a massive error of judgment.  I have to go to a meeting when we reopen but advice is that it doesn’t look good for me.  Also I can’t really job hunt because all the companies in my field are closed over Christmas.  I’ve never been in trouble before and I’m feeling sick and scared.

Ironically, my good friend has just got a big promotion, which is deserved.  She’d planned a big night out to celebrate, which I agreed to go to before all this happened.  When this happened I said I couldn’t go, I was too miserable and probably shouldn’t spend the money.  She said she’d pay for me.  I still didn’t want to go and said I’d put a damper on the night.  She said it would do me good to be distracted for a night.  I told her she was insensitive and if it was for any other reason I would go but not for this. She told me that the trouble I was in was my own fault and I was selfish for not wanting to celebrate her success just because I’ve f***ed up.  I was really hurt that she said this and it escalated.

I didn’t go, she still went with the other people but she’s still annoyed with me.

"Am I responsible for ruining my friend’s social life?

Kay - my friend from church. We don’t go to the same school. She’s two years younger than me. 

Lacy - Kay’s friend at church. She goes to the same school as Kay. She’s 17, same age as me. We hang out because of Kay, but we just don’t click. Her father wants to be an elder at our church (this is important).

Over two months ago, I was with Kay. She said that Lacy told her a secret that she shouldn’t tell anyone, but she wanted to tell me. Before I could stop her, she told me that Lacy told her she was a lesbian.

 Lacy being a lesbian is a big problem if her father wants to be an elder. We believe that in order for a man to be an elder, his family has to be in order, too. If it gets out to other members of the church, he’ll never be an elder. If he does become an elder and it comes out, he’ll have to quit. It would be a social mess. My church experienced an elder gone bad (he was a charming narcissist) when I was a kid. It ripped the church in half and I lost friends. I felt like I needed to do something. I felt like it’d be too weird to talk directly to her parents, so I told my parents so they could talk to Lacy’s parents. They did. Apparently, Lacy’s father thought it didn’t matter because Lacy is an adult and her behavior has nothing to do with him. I mean, we’re almost adults, but I don’t think anyone thinks that. She still lives with her parents. I know he can’t just tell her not to be a lesbian. My parents thought it’d be best to tell another elder. Then there was a decision that Lacy’s father wouldn’t be an elder. 

A couple of weeks ago, Lacy came to me. Her parents are now really angry with her. She asked me if Kay told me she was a lesbian. I didn’t want to say she told, but I couldn’t dodge the question. I told her Kay told me, but I was trying to help her family and it backfired. Now, Lacy has told everyone that Kay can’t keep a secret. I’m pretty sure that accusation has spread at their school, too. Kay is so sad looking now. She’s polite, but she won’t really talk to me. She hasn’t been back to church yet. I think I ruined her reputation. Lacy is about to graduate but Kay has to be in that school two more years. Am I a jerk? Did I handle this all wrong?

EDIT: I wanted her parents to know about Lacy so the whole church wouldn’t know and her whole family ostracized. No one except my parents, her parents, and one elder know.",1
"Between us, my husband and I have 5 children: his (21F and 27F), mine (14m and 12F) and ours (6F). His girls have never lived with us. I wanted them to, but when we got married seven years ago, 27F was already an adult with her own life, and 21F begged her father to let her finish high school where she was with her grandmother. So I thought. 

The girls stopped getting along as teenagers, so hearing that they had reconnected recently and were even taking trips together was good news. Until last week. 21F posted a picture with 27F apologizing for ""blaming her for the ""situation"" where too much responsibility was put on her"" and thanking her for raising her after their grandmother had passed away **seven** years ago"". 

Through the comments on that post, I found out that the grandmother was not only no longer alive, but had passed soon after the announcement that 21F would be staying with her to finish school. The thread got a lot of attention from our relatives. They're shocked by this, and so am I. 

Everyone is assuming that I not only knew about this but approved. I'm getting judgement on all sides. I don't even know how to respond or where to start. I would NEVER have approved of any of this and would have had it out with my husband if I'd even known that he would think of it. I'll admit, I probably could have asked more questions, but I spent the next few years overwhelmed with everything else with all the other kids that I just trusted. I never thought my husband would casually lie about where his kids lived for....I don't even know what reason! To offload them? Start a new life?

Right now, I need to gather information and figure things out, and I'm overwhelmed. I need her to take down the post so I can stop getting bombarded and think for a second. She refuses to take down the post just because I ""can't handle the truth"". I can't focus enough to think anything through with constant demands to address one specific thing or another through comments and messages. She has the right to talk about this, but I really can't have it be now. AITA?",1

"I'm the step father of a 16 year old girl, ""Beth."" I married her mom when she was 14, but I've known her since she was 13. I don't have any kids of my own, so I don't always know what I'm doing, but I try my best not to parent or discipline her too much because I'm not in the position to. I let her mom take that role and I don't want to over step boundaries, but I also try to be there for her as a father, since hers isn't in the picture. We've had a good relationship, more friendly than father-daughter, up until recently.

Her biological father was Samoan and very large. I mention his race because from what we've gathered, it leads to a genetic predisposition to obesity. And Beth is very large. Morbidly obese. Both my wife and I aren't, and we cook pretty healthy. We're not vegan or health nuts, but like a ""dessert every week"" kind of thing.

I've always been worried about Beth's weight, but since she stays active and eats our cooking I figured it's a genetic thing that we can't really help. But since I've been working from home, I notice how much she actually cooks for herself. She's good at it, but she makes things like homemade donuts, deep fried pickles, fried chicken, and other unhealthy things. I asked her where she learned to cook this, and she said YouTube, since she can't get food anymore.

She gets an allowance and does babysitting sometimes so I know she has some money. But I didn't know she was spending it on junk food all the time, and now she's cooking it. I talked to my wife about it, and she said she'll handle it. Beth keeps doing it. She'll make enough homemade donuts to feed 4 people and eat it herself. This is NOT helping her, despite my wife saying she's perfectly healthy.

My wife said that it's best not to push her or she'll develop an eating disorder. I think something needs to be done. After trying to talk with her and my wife, I just started locking up oils, butters, sugars, whatever she uses to make this stuff and requiring her to ask permission to use it.

Both my wife and Beth are angry with me now, saying I'm shaming her and need to mind my own business. Now she took her to go get some take out. It's like they're trying to make a point at the expense of Beth's health and I feel conflicted. Am I an asshole for getting more strict with her eating?",1
"To start off, I (29f) got pregnant at 18 and had my daughter, Irene (10f) at 19. When I first announced my pregnant, I didn’t get much support considering I got pregnant fresh out of high school to my now ex, Geo (29m) whom I was only dating for 3 months. At the time, I decided to keep her because my dumb self felt that she would help bring us closer together and “make” our relationship. Since everyone knows having a baby can either make or break a relationship.

At the time, I got no support nor any good reactions from when I first announced my pregnancy. One of the not so good responses was from my best friend, Ella (29f), whom at the time told me “Remember that you have options, and to not feel pressured to keep this baby but I’ll support any decision you make”. She never liked my ex, and while she never admitted it, I could tell she didn’t like the fact that I was pregnant.

Fast forward to now, Ella’s friend, Lily (31f) and her husband recently announced their pregnancy after being married for 3 years. It was caught on video and posted to social media, where Ella was very overjoyed and ecstatic. Not gonna lie, although I am happy for Lily, I also feel hurt. Knowing that Ella reacted this way, but couldn’t react that same towards my pregnancy.

A few days after, I invited Ella out for lunch and explained how I do wish she would’ve reacted that same way with me when I announced I was pregnant. She seemed to understand, and say “I hear you. I am so sorry for how I reacted to you being pregnant. I was young, and should’ve chosen better words as I was only looking out for you since you had Irene very young and I wasn’t a huge fan of Geo, if I could turn back time, then I would so I could have a better reaction”. 

I let it go after, however, I don’t know if I can get over her reaction. I mean, yeah the reaction was nice considering both Lily and her husband are happily married and have a wonderful relationship, however, I feel resentful. Resentful of the fact that barely anyone reacted nicely to me being pregnant, and it was only after I gave birth when people started to care. My own sister (now 34f) even told me straight up and I quote, “you should get an abortion”. She didn’t even acknowledge Irene at first. 

I know I shouldn’t feel this way, but I am angry with Ella and have since not spoken to her since our lunch which was about week ago. She has tried to reach out, but I muted her everywhere. I mean, what difference does it make whether you’re married or not? My boyfriend (31m) told me that although he understands where I’m coming from, I shouldn’t put all the blame on Ella and Lily.

"I (20f) and my friend, Emma (f22) recently went on a trip to California. She asked if I wanted to go on the trip with her because we'd stay with one of her other friends (Lena, 24f) and go sightseeing. I agreed, we booked our tickets, and she commuted to my city where we'd be taking off from and stayed the night. She told me her ticket back was a lot later in the day on the day we get back to the city, and I told her not to worry, she can stay with me and I'll take her to the station.

I told her specifically that I wanted to go see the Golden Gate Bridge and the Japanese Tea Garden. Her friend's parents housed us at their house so we'd have more room and privacy, and she also picked us up from the airport, prepared gifts for us, and excitedly told us that she's so happy to have guests. We saw the bridge twice, the Japanese Tea Garden, Ghirardelli Square, Japan Town, the Pier, and tons more, and took tons of pictures. Emma always asked if I wanted my picture taken in front of things, and offered to retake or take more photos if I was unhappy with them.

After the trip, someone had taken Emma's carryon, which had everything she brought. When I grabbed mine, Emma said, ""OP, my carryon isn't here"", and I didn't really think much of it. It was a long flight, I was tired, and it was super early in the morning. She said that she wanted to try and find it before the person who took it left with it, and she hurried off. I didn't see her past customs, so I left to meet my boyfriend who was picking us up and left without her.

Eventually, I messaged her and told her that she could find her own way back to the station. Emma was confused and said that she was supposed to go back with me and my boyfriend since her train was later, and she was just waiting for flight staff to get her carryon back, and if I was leaving her there. 

I asked her what she wanted me to do, run after her? She said that she just wanted a bit of understanding that she had her carryon taken, because everything she brought was in the bag and it was a stressful situation. 

I snapped back and said that the trip we went on wasn't even to sightsee, it was just so she could see her friend, and she responded that we went to see everything I specifically wanted to see and more. Further, Emma said that Lena hosted us well and drove us around the entire week we were there, housed us, her parents fed us breakfast in the mornings, and Lena paid for all the gas, parking, and tolls. I can admit that I was a little passive-aggressive, but she went on to say that if my luggage was taken, she would be with me as support: I said well it's not my fault she lost her luggage.

Emma hasn't spoken to me since, and has since removed me off everything. I don't think I was wrong, but AITA?",1

I still have to cook and clean obviously. He said it was fine and that he'd be taking care of him on his own.


The other day he called me in the afternoon saying he was stuck in a 2hr meeting and asked if I could go pick his nephew up from school. I said I was having lunch with mom and discussing family issues. He insisted but I reminded him that he said he'd be taking care of his nephew including school pickup/dropoff. I suggested he try to get off work or call some family member to go pick him up. He tried to argue but I hung up.


I went home at 3 and surprisinglyfound my husband there. He was angry he started yelling at me calling me selfish and unfeeling. I told him that his lack of mamagement wasn't my fault. he yelled saying that my lunch with mom could've ""fucking"" waited but I chose to be ""fucking petty"" just to prove a point. I said that wasn't true and told him to get over himself and stop acting like he was the victim when he put himself in this situation knowing he wouldn't commit. He yelled that ge was trying to do all he can to help his brother out but it was me who's playing victim after I refused to help out. We argued some more and I ended up going to stay with my mom for the night.

He texted me some choice words that's when I turned my phone off. We're still arguing about it.",1
"This is an ongoing issue going on in my home. I 33F am currently pregnant with my first child. I live in a two bedroom home with my husband and step-daughter (23F). Step-daughter and I get along fine no big issues but we also are not super close.

Now that the baby is coming we need more space unfortunately we can't afford a new home. I brought up to my husband asking Step-daughter to move out. My reasoning is that we really need her room for the new baby and she is an adult with a full time job so it is time for her to be on her own anyway.

My husband agreed and we brought it up to her at dinner one night. We told her we would help with her first 2 months rent. I told her it would be fun her and I could go shopping and I will help her decorate her new apartment. We tried to be as gentle as we could but she was very quiet. 

Privately she told my husband that even though she as a full time job she cannot afford to live on her own. My husband told her she did not need to move out so now we are scrambling trying to find space for new baby.

The other day I was home alone with Step- daughter and tried to talk to her about it again. I offered  to help her find a roommate and she snapped on me. She snapped on me and told me to just leave her alone and locked herself in her room.

When my husband got home from work he was mad at me and told me to leave her alone and not bring it up anymore. Things have been awkward and uncomfortable since making my pregnancy very stressful. 

She is 23 old enough to be on her own she has a job and we are willing to help her. We need space for our baby I do not see how I am in the wrong here.",1
"I (43M) think that my fiance (21F) might be pregnant. 

She’s been nauseous a lot and craving a lot of unusual food. In addition, she’s been uncharacteristically sullen even though she’s usually the happiest person I know. I don’t know why she won’t take a pregnancy test except that maybe she assumes that I already have three children and wouldn’t welcome the news. 

Yesterday afternoon she got dizzy. When I said the housekeeper could make her some chicken noodle soup, she said she suddenly decided she hated chicken soup and went to go lay down so I went to do some work.

A few hours later, I went to grab some water from the fridge. When I lean into  the fridge, I start smelling a funny smell. I see that it was coming from a wrapped up dish and I look at it more closely and it looked like this Middle Eastern dish. 

I was worried it would smell up the rest of the fridge and there seemed to be very little leftovers so I tossed it in the trash. 

A while later, my girlfriend is knocking on my office door demanding to know where the rest of her Shamburak was. 

She started ranting that obviously the housekeeper wouldn’t have thrown it out so that leaves me. I asked what Shamburak even was and she said it was Kurdish comfort food and I had no right. 

I told her it was emitting a pungent odor and gently reminded her that this was my house and that if she hated chicken soup, there are plenty of dishes that the housekeeper knew how to make that would also smell better. 

She then starts crying and bringing up that one time one of my friends joked that she looked like blonde Princess Jasmine and I happened to laugh along. She then gets even more irrational and says that she’s afraid that I’d hate any child of ours if they didn’t happen to have blonde hair like her, and instead got strong Middle Eastern ethnic features.

That frankly came out of nowhere and I ended up leaving the house to let her cool down. 

AITA? I feel like what I did was no big deal since the fridge was smelling strange. In addition, my fiancé accuses me of being pushy/ controlling yet I never pressured her to take a pregnancy test.",1
"Throw away

I (34m) have a wife (32f) and we have two children 4f and 7m. I work as a manager at a care home and my wife owns a bakery with her mum. My wife cooks all the time because she is much better at cooking than I am, I cook sometimes. She is the one who takes care of the house, kids, and chores.

Yesterday when I came back from work dinner was ready so I plated it up for everyone while my wife was washing her hands (my kids like their food cut up) I was cutting their chickens into pieces and it looked a bit pink I told my wife to look at it and she said “it’s a little pink but it’s fine”. I told her I’m not letting them eat this if it’s pink, she told me to stop being a baby and it won’t kill them. I kept telling her it’s pink in the middle they shouldn’t eat that they can get food poisoning and that’s it’s dangerous for them. She told me “if you don’t want them eating it then you can cook their dinner”. 

I made them cheese and ham toasties, also made her one but she didn’t eat it. She told me she isn’t talking to me if I think her cooking is horrible. I don’t think it’s horrible I just didn’t want our kids eating that. I told her to stop thinking she was right. So AITA?",1
"I(F28) just got laid off work about a month ago and got offered the opportunity to move in with my younger sister(F23) and her husband(M25). They don't have kids yet so my sister offered me the spare room while I look for a job. After a few days I noticed him making small remarks about things around the house changing. We'd never had any personal conflict for as long as I've known him but he's quite traditionalist about the household chores.

He usually works 5-6 days a week as an engineer and my sister works part time at a day care in the mornings. So main issue is he's the only one with a car because my sister doesn't drive and he drops her off in the mornings, she then takes the bus back home. I try to be as helpful as I can around the house cleaning but I can't cook the meals my brother in law wants or likes. 

Which is why my sister does pretty much all the cooking as she usually would. Now I feel pretty useless as I'm just cleaning or sitting around, and when I mentioned this to them he said I should fetch the groceries. I tried to tell him he is the one with the car and getting groceries is almost impossible on the bus. I told him he could easily drive all of us there in the evening and we could get everything we needed at once.

He said I was being lazy and not doing any of my 'duties' at home so I called him out for his ancient views and called him a misogynist who needs to get with the times. My sister has now sided with her husband and says I should apologise and be grateful as it is. AITA? ",1
"I (32F) and my fiance (30M) are getting married in three months. We've done some major and minor planning, including rules. We specifically want NO kids at the wedding. My brother (35M) and I have always been close we've gotten through a lot together, he has two amazing kids (2 and 3), i couldn't be any happier to be their aunt. Their mother has had issues with substance abuse so she isn't in their lives, my brother raises the kids by himself, which is convient because he has an at home job.
Me and my fiance decided we did not want any oids at our wedding because we were going to be drinking, partying, and other stuff I personally wouldn't want kids to be around. We've also had struggles trying to have children of our own, and I recently had a miscarriage in February. The miscarriage was devastating, of course my brother was there to comfort me but the sight of my nieces shattered me even more, I asked him to not bring them around me for a while. He didn't respond to that well and stopped visiting me at all, he said via text messages ""If your own nieces cannot come, neither will I."" My fiance said it was okay to ask for no kids to be around, but my parents were frustrated. They also stopped visiting me.
I eventually sent out invitations to all my loved ones, the card had all the details including the bolded ""NO KIDS."" Majority of family was okah with that and didn't have young kids anyway. My brother on the otherhand was going to be in my wedding, but once he read the invitation he sent me a text stating, ""Wouldn't your nieces make great flower girls, going but dresses now."" I replied saying, ""No need, they cannot come inside my wedding, no hard feelings."" He then said, ""It shouldn't apply to them, they are family, what color should they get, blue or silver?"" I then replied, ""None, if you feel like you cannot be separated from your children for a couple of hours then you cannot come to my wedding, my rules are clear and final on the invitation."" I blocked my brother after that.
I have nonstop been getting text after text, call after call, begging me to talk to my brother and allow my nieces to come, my own parents have stated that until my nieces and brother are allowed at my wedding, they will not be there.",1
" Now, hear me out here. I promise there's some substance to my side of the story.

My wife (34f) and I (36m) have been married for six years with two sons (5 and 3). We are both members of the congregation of a comparatively progressive church and attended mass whenever we got the chance before the pandemic.

Flashback to April of this year. As per most Sunday mornings, my wife, kids, and I were attending weekly mass, though it was virtual now. Our priest, who we'll call Father Joseph, announced that our church would be hosting a Zoom event on Easter Sunday. After the service, him and I were messaging about the event. He seemed rather excited about the event, and since he always loved when I brought my sons to services I told him I would attend.

Now of course, as an avid Christian man and lover of holiday spirit, I decided that I would go all out for my sons and decorate the house so that this year's Easter as well as the event would still feel special for them despite what we were going through with it having been still around the beginning of the pandemic.

For the next few weeks leading up to Easter Sunday, my wife would sometimes ask me about what we were planning to do that day. I kept telling her not to worry, and that I had something planned. I wanted my big Easter plans to surprise her too, and she deserved a break. She didn't need to have the stress of planning a holiday for our sons on her shoulders too.

Skip to the morning of Easter Sunday. I was awake much earlier than the rest of the family, having been setting up my decorations and getting ready for the Zoom event. My wife came into the living room to see all of the pastel decorations and balloons, as well as the breakfast I had made especially for the kids. I stopped her when she went to eat the kid's breakfast, and she asked me why she couldn't eat it. I told her that I wanted everything to look perfect for the kids when they woke up, and that I had saved some extra pancakes for us.

Apparently that was the wrong answer.

My wife's birthday fell on the same day as Easter Sunday that year, and I got too caught up in trying to do something nice for the kids to pay attention to the date. Because of the pandemic, we have been spending much more time together now than ever before, and I am afraid that this mistake is causing a rift in our marriage. I really need to get an outside opinion on this, but I am not comfortable talking to anyone I know about this.",1
"In January of 2019, my husband was diagnosed with a brain tumour. It was in a completely inoperable part of the brain, and was told me had six months to live. He stuck it out and died in October, three months longer than he was expected to. He was always positive, and decided a few weeks after his diagnosis that he would write letters for our daughters for significant events in their lives. My husband was my soulmate, and the past few months have been difficult knowing I’ve lost him 

We have two daughters, Mia who is 21 and Imogen (Immy) who is 19. All three of us have become a lot closer since their dads death, and we’ve all really struggled. My husband and I were together since we were children, got married when we were 18 and we were approaching our 20th wedding anniversary when he passed. 

In February of this year, Mia got married to a boy she’s been with for about 6 years. I absolutely love her husband and he’s been incredibly supportive during all of our grief. My husband wrote a letter for Mia to open on her wedding day. It’s worth noting that my daughters were unaware of these letters, it was my job to give them to our daughters. 

Her wedding day comes around and I just can’t bring myself to give her the letter. I read it and just wanted to keep it to myself. I had his handwriting and his words and it felt like he was there, and I couldn’t bare the thought of giving that up yet. I was fully intending on giving her all the other letters as the events happened. 

Last week Mia and her husband bought their first home together. They’d been living at our home since they got married, and so had a lot of stuff to pack and move to their new house. Mia asked me where her important documents were, passport, birth certificate etc, so I told her they were in my top drawer of my dresser in my bedroom. The only letter that was in there was the one I was meant to give her on her wedding day, the rest were hidden away. 

She immediately recognised his handwriting and of course it was addressed to her, so she read it and broke down. She came and found me and started screaming at me asking how I could be so selfish. I didn’t really know what to say apart from the fact that I wanted to keep it and she could take a picture of it. Both my daughters called me an asshole and are convinced I’m keeping them from a load of their dads stuff. AITA?

EDIT - have your opinions, that’s why I posted this. But do not come into my PMs and tell me I should’ve been the one to die instead. You’re worse than I am if that’s what gets you off. Sending me death threats isn’t okay either",1
"*edit* My kids willingly toss these items out on their own as they care for their pets more than they do squishy toys. They are hurt by always being disappointed in hoping their aunt would give them something they asked for or something less dangerous for the pets they care for. I did word this wrong and i apologize for that. My kids love the animals we have and understand that protecting them matters. 

I, (f32), am preparing to throw my child their birthday party. I go all out every year with themes of my kids favorite show/movie of the time. I make decor and treats that are on theme with the event and everyone we know is always invited with the idea that gifts are not needed to bring. We just wish to spend time with the family to celebrate my children. With that being said, most people bring something small anyways as a show of good faith and we never have issues with that until recently. For context, my family rescues animals. We currently have eight ferrets in our care, (and no they dont stink like people assume). Our pets are free roaming which means they have a very large cage, but the house is designed for them to run freely day and night like a cat would with the house being picked up/dealt with for their safety every night. Ferrets, like most animals, love rubbery items, but will rip said item apart, potentially swallowing the pieces which can lead to severe health complications/death. Every holiday/birthday we always remind our family members that we do not allow rubber rings, stress balls, pop-its, etc. as gifts for our kids as years ago a rubber ring made its way into the house via a toy gift bag and we lost one of our rescue runts. It devastated our whole family and changed how we viewed our animals, leading to us starting the rescuing, and we vowed to never let it happen again. 
Every year since this incident however my SIL, (who gave my child the gift bag of doom just mentioned), no matter how many times she is reminded, will bring gifts to our children that can harm our pets. My youngest gets excited to see these gifts, but has to end her day in tears because I have to throw away her gift once everyone leaves. She understands even at a young age that she cant keep that gift and we always take her to pick something new out the next day. While it has worked out in the past, I have become tired of having to make my child feel bad after she opens her gifts. I also am tired of having to purchase something new for my child in the name of her aunt. Buying this new gift doesnt break the bank, but it isnt something we budget for in the week leading up to these parties. 
What I am asking is if I would be the ahole for checking my SIL's gift before it hits the gift table and giving it back to her or even tossing it out in front of her if it contains any possible hazard for my pets. I know that she is currently not in the best place financially and that she is going through her own personal stressors, but I dont feel that it is fair to ignore my pets safety and my child's feelings about these doom gifts just because she is going through stuff. We have multiple birthday/holiday parties throughout the year and each time the reminder is given and each time it is ignored. I feel I should also mention that she is currently moving in with someone who also has a ferret. So i feel that she really needs to understand the potential danger.
So....would I be in the wrong for doing this?",1
"My (22M) girlfriend (23F) is a very artistic person who loves trying new things. Her most recent obsession is songwriting. About two months ago, a friend of hers got her to attend a beginner’s workshop for it, and she’s been hooked ever since. She’s signed up for guitar and voice lessons, and writes whenever she has a moment of free time. When she finishes something, I’m the first person she shows it to. I love seeing her so excited about something, and I’m glad she feels comfortable enough to share her art with me.   


She is, however, terrible at singing. Like truly awful. And to be fully honest, she’s not that good at guitar either. But obviously I never wanted to tell her that. If she asked me how something sounded, I always said it was beautiful. I didn’t think there was anything wrong with this kind of lie since it supported her and made her feel more confident. She disagrees.  


To give some context as to how she found out I was lying: a few weeks ago, she asked me if it would be a good idea to start a TikTok page for her singing and songwriting. I could tell she was excited about it, but was nervous about putting her work on the internet. I told her she was crazy talented and should go for it. She lit up after I said this, and in the following days worked really hard to make videos of her original music. They didn’t gain much traction, but she seemed to be having fun being a content creator, so I felt like I’d made the right decision in encouraging her.  


But yesterday, she walked into our bedroom sobbing and demanded to know why I’d told her she could sing. I asked her what she meant, and she threw her phone down for me to look at. On it was one of her TikToks. It was one of those trends where you duet another musician by singing color-coded lyrics. Her video had been reposted to a “cringe” meme page and had blown up overnight. The comments were all horrible. Truthful, in some cases, but really mean about it.   


She asked me again through tears why I’d never told her she was bad. I told her she wasn’t bad, people were just mean. “If hundreds of comments say I can’t sing, then I can’t sing,” she snapped at me, “so stop lying.” “Okay,” I said. “Fine. You’re definitely no Beyonce. You have a really unique sound though and I love that you share it.” I thought she’d feel encouraged by this, but it only made things worse. She started crying harder and insisted that the only reason she posted things in the first place was because I told her she was talented, and now she’s been humiliated in front of thousands. She’s deleted her TikTok account along with all her videos, and hasn’t stopped crying or talked to me since. I feel like she’s blowing this out of proportion; I was just trying to do a nice thing by supporting her, and it’s not my fault the internet is what it is. I don’t think I should’ve done anything different, but since the internet put me in this position, I’m curious if it will think I’m in the wrong. AITA?",1
"My niece is 17, and she’s kinda a bitch to her parents especially her mom, my SIL. About 17 years ago my manwhore of a baby brother had an affair with some random woman he worked with. His wife of 5 years forgave him, even after finding out that the woman he was with was pregnant with my brothers baby. Nine months later out pops my niece. Unfortunately, my niece’s mother past way very soon after she was born, so my brother had full custody of her. Unbeknownst to me, they have been telling my niece that she is the biological daughter of my SIL.

A few weeks ago I had a baby boy of my own and have been FaceTiming my brother and SIL regularly to show him off. This week when I FaceTimed my SIL, about 10 minutes in I heard the voice of my niece. She was yelling about some teenage nonsense at an incredible volume. My SIL called her down to her and asked her to quite down. My niece came down and started screaming expletives in my SIL’s face, my SIL, not wanting me to see this, she told me she would call me back after she finished dealing with her daughter and hung up. About half an hour later she called me back in tears and confessed to me she didn’t know how to handle her daughter anymore. I consoled her until the end of the FaceTime and immediately was furious with my niece.

I messaged her over Facebook and told her off, one of my messages was, “You don’t understand how blessed you are to have your mom, she doesn’t have to be there for you, she could’ve left your dad when she found out about you.” I didn’t receive a message back. 

That night I get a call from my brother asking what I told his child. I told him exactly what I said and I really don’t regret it* . Long story short, her parents ended up needing to tell her that she was the product of her fathers affair and was not related to her mother. For this my brother called me a massive cunt and said I fractured his family. I argued back, saying I realize she didn’t know her mom wasn’t her biological mother for a little before he hung up on me. AITA?

*I phrased this incorrectly, when he asked I told him I don’t regret what I told her. THEN he told me that they had to explain that their daughter was a product of infidelity. I do very much regret being the first person to tell my niece the circumstances of her birth.",1
"My (30M) girlfriend (27F) is really into knitting and has been long before we started dating 3 months ago. At first it didn’t bother me and I thought it was cool she had a hobby but then I realized just how much she does it.

Granted, she’s not pulling out the knitting hook at dinner or anything but it seems anytime we’re watching TV together or just hanging out at her place she’s always working on some project. She said she needs to keep her hands busy and it’s like fidgeting for her, but I severely doubt that she can be fully present. You don’t have to pay attention when you fidget and she literally always jokes that she doesn’t know how to count. She claimed it’s not all the time… but it’s definitely more often than not. She argued that she can follow TV show plots just fine but when I quizzed her on some details she couldn’t answer some of the questions sooo… I think my point stands. Then she said “If it’s an important conversation I obviously put my work down” but I think we have different definitions of what important means. 

I also told her I would like to be able to cuddle and physically interact with her during TV time. She said we can still cuddle but it’s literally not the same? I want her to be interested in me, not some pile of yarn.

This might be petty but I think I might feel better about it if she knitted things for me, but it always seems to be bags or clothes for herself or like random squares. She did make a pretty cute toy for my dog though, that was actually nice. 

Anyway I sat her down the other day and told her my perspective, and instead of being willing to compromise, she told me that I’m the one that’s not listening to her and essentially called me an asshole. 

She’s a great girl and I don’t want to lose her over this but also not sure what to do. AITA?",1
"I was 28 and my ex wife was 27 when we had our daughter (26). Our son was born 3 years later. 

We were both young and saddled with financial problems. I was working 80+ hour weeks to climb the ladder and to at least make my expensive degree worth it.

My ex wife and I fought all the time because I felt pressured to marry after she got pregnant and I felt she could have worked more. 

Therefore, growing up my two older kids did have to experience me coming home at 10pm, missing award ceremonies, and cancelling vacation plans. 
I also find it crazy how I berated my kids for academic performance in a way I could never imagine doing so now. 

I fought with my ex wife about money and would sometimes return clothes she bought for the kids when I saw they came from department stores rather than stores with Target level affordability because I didn’t get why kids needed that. I also  took arguments into screaming matches and left in a very bad way. 

I admit I have a strained relationship that I’m now repairing with my kids. My daughter now comes over to the house I share with my new wife a couple times a month and sometimes stays over. 

My wife (28) just gave birth a year ago. I’m now in a high level position at my company so I can step out whenever and get myself days off so I like planning fun activities and surprising my wife with going shopping or date night. 

When my daughter is here, I invite her to come along if we’re doing something family stuff. Her attitude varies a lot but I let it go because she’s getting therapy and treats her one year old brother well. 

However, yesterday we all went shopping and my wife is in the process of remodeling our son’s room. My daughter kicked up an attitude when my wife wanted to go to the home section of Bloomingdale’s and pick out items. She also wanted to buy some new clothes. 

When my wife was out of earshot my daughter asked why she needed to buy kid stuff from an upscale department store and the baby wouldn’t remember the clothes ever. I had the same argument when I was younger but I learned that sometimes it doesn’t matter what I think works, and I’d rather just make my wife happy.

So I told her to stop bringing up the age old argument about upscale goods. Then I told her that I thought the same way as her in the past but I’ve learned a lot about compromise over the years. I then mentioned that I feel happy for a chance to do it right this time, and I’m a better dad this time around. And this was a new beginning, a second chance. 

She immediately teared up and said “ Congrats, guess you changed.” She wouldn’t accept my explanation that included being a better dad to her too and ended up Ubering back to her apartment.

AITA? This statement was meant to say I’ve done wrong and am doing better but she’s acting like I mortally insulted her in some way. She now refuses to respond to any form of outreach by me.",1
"Weird title, but that’s kind of my jam at this stage.

Would I, 16m, be the asshole if I yelled at my ex friend, 16f. I’ve been here before, I’d say a month ago with my problems with E. A lot more has happened since then and our mutual friends are on my side in this situation.

In my opinion, I have an extremely valid reason. Since my last post, me and E made up (alas, I got no verbal apology) and have since fallen out again, about two weeks ago.   


My friend, we’ll call him R (I believe I mentioned him), and E were having a debate on how clingy E is with her bf. I came in and asked them to stop and said ‘Love isn’t a good thing to be talking about at eight in the morning,’ so they left it at that. Then E started it up again in our group chat.

I intervened with her spam messages about it saying ‘It happened hours ago, drop it’ and she then proceeded to lose it with me. She tried using the fact that I’m trans as some leverage, even when I’m already incredibly open with it, and then proceeded to say ‘Just fucking kys’ and that we weren’t ever friends. I left the group afterwards.

I met R the next day, she wasn’t talking to him either so he said that he wasn’t going to talk to her until she apologised (which she had no intention of doing and she still hasn’t.)

A few days later, I’m added back and I find out that E refuses to even acknowledge my existence and calling me by ‘the other one’. E removed me from the group an hour after. I didn’t say or do anything wrong, only having a conversation with her bf about how cold it was.

We leave it at that. The next time I see E in person, she’s avoiding me and giving me nasty looks every chance she gets. She’s back on speaking terms with R, but R still wants nothing to do with her. 

Tonight and a few times beforehand our mutual friends, G and S, have been having similar issues with E. G sent in screenshots of E telling G’s bf to off himself and slagging him off for no reason. S mentioned that E was shit talking her, yet she won’t admit it, E’s also been spreading around issues a member of S’ family has without her knowledge.

I and everyone else have grown shit sick of it, because she’s acting like we’re all friends again, when it’s the opposite. I’ve openly told my friends that I’m going to call her out on this tomorrow if she sits with us, they’ve all said I should.",1
"I 18f have a brother 16m. He brought a friend over after school, they were going to hang out for a bit before meeting other people and going somewhere cinema I think. 

This friend of his isn’t dating my good friend but they’re  talking at the minute and it’s heading some direction I think so when they went into the kitchen I quizzed his friend all about it and got chatting to him for AGES then they left for where they where going. 

Some time after my brother started to get mad at me because he’s spent a long time with no friends (which I knew about) and he wanted to spend time with this guy before they left. And apparently he was making it obvious without saying anything that he wanted me to leave but I never picked up on it. 

I don’t get it though because that’s just weird like possessive almost if I want to chat to someone I’ll chat to someone. And if his friend didn’t want to talk to me he wouldn’t have been so talkative. ",1
"I haven't been doing well mentally and it all came crashing down yesterday. I'm stressed and struggle with depression.

I called my partner at around 5pm and started crying, full on sobbing. He told me he was busy and he'd call in half an hour. 

He only called back 4 hours later at 9pm. At that time he was tired but still listened to me. I cried a lot and he calmed me down and gave me advice and I started feeling a little better. 

After we called for 40 minutes he said he was gonna sleep now. I was still crying a bit at that point and asked him to please just stay a little bit longer. I told him I needed him to be there for me now. He said he was tired. I started sobbing again and asked why he didn't call 4 hours ago and he didn't answer. He said no one cared about him and I heard him turn his volume down to the point he wouldn't hear me cry anymore.

I do care about him, I always show up for him, I always ask him so many questions about his day, when I calls or texts I drop everything just to respond. I regulary beg him to tell me more about him till the point of him telling me to shut up about it and he doesn't want to talk.

I feel like I'm the problem because I've been super annoying the past few weeks as my condition has been getting worse. But I don't cry to him like this often, it happens maybe 4 times in a year. AITA?

Edit: I apologised to him and told him I wouldn't do it again. He told me he didn't mute me but fell asleep and that he was really sorry about it. I said I was sorry for making him feel uncared for and he asked when did he ever say that? He says he doesn't remember saying it and that he never felt that way either. We're okay. It was a misunderstanding. I won't cry in front of him again because I know he deserves better, so I will be better.",1
"I’ve been playing Dungeons and Dragons a lot with a friend of mine (both 24M) for the past 4ish years. Recently, we’ve been getting into arguments involving characters with disabilities. I said that I’m uncomfortable with characters having disabilities, and he doesn’t accept it, and keeps pushing me to stop and to let his characters have disabilities (he isn’t disabled in real life himself, for reference).

This is the main point our fights are over. He calls me ableist for not wanting to interact with the characters he would play with disabilities. Last night, I was messing around with the new Microsoft AI assistant preview, and used it to create some character pictures. Some of them have small details with the hands that are off, like having one missing finger or having weird-looking flaps between some fingers.

I showed them to him, saying I’d like to play as them, and he blew up, telling me that I’m being hypocritical because they have disabilities. To be honest, I didn’t realize the imperfections of the AI images until he pointed them out. I said that I wouldn’t be playing them with having missing fingers or skin flaps, as that’s not what I want for the characters. I had to go back to work, so I said I’d be back soon, and he went offline and is now refusing to talk to me.

I feel I have a right to say that I’m uncomfortable with something when playing roleplaying games with just the two of us, but he thinks I shouldn’t dictate his characters like that and I should get over it because people with disabilities exist in real life.

I have absolutely no problems with disabled people in real life, it’s just in the fantasy games I have with him.

AITA for asking to not have characters with disabilities?",1
"I know this sounds bad, but hear me out. im using a throwaway cuz my wife uses reddit, so please don't upvote this. I just want honest feedback.

My wife (29f) and I (27m) do well financially, so we decided to have our fourth child. Every single pregnancy we've been through my wife has been a complete nightmare. Some things I can deal with, like waking up to the sound of her puking her guts out every morning, but when she starts demanding I go to the store every day to get her snacks or set up her foot bath thingy because her feet are swollen, I get a little impatient. I work way longer hours than her in a much more physically demanding profession (I'm a plumber, she's an engineer) so I think we're putting an equal amount of effort into this baby. 

And it's not like I don't help around the house, either. She does all the cooking and dishes, but I do laundry, take out garbage, and mow the lawn (we pay someone to do the floors and bathrooms weekly). My MIL comes over to help with the kids because she says I'm useless (ive been meaning to make a justnomil post about her), and while I appreciate the help I'm sick of her crap. Just because I want one hour of video games to myself a day instead of cleaning up messes in the kitchen doesn't mean I'm ""useless"". 

This all came to head yesterday when my wife screamed at me from the kitchen to get off my ass and entertain our twins so she could focus on her meatloaf. I made a dumb joke about how this is the third meatloaf we'll be eating this week, and she. lost. her. shit. She told me how I have no sympathy for the fact that she's pregnant, I should be taking on more of her chores since I can't breastfeed, but then I reminded her that I still work a lot more hours than her, so I think we're basically both pregnant.

She got really quiet, and has only spoken to me regarding the kids since. I don't think I'm wrong but I'll apologize to her if it makes her happy. AITA here?

Edit: my wife does get breaks, guys. I set up the annoying foot bath thing every night while she does dishes and then she relaxes with it while watching YouTube every night while I put the kids to bed. She also won't eat my cooking because she grew up in southeast Asia and doesn't like American food. It's not my fault she's picky.


Edit 2: it's a Korean BBQ meatloaf she makes since some people pointed out meatloaf is typically American. Anyway, my wife found this post and now she wants us to do couples counseling. Thanks for the feedback, guys.",1
"My boyfriend (24) and I (28) have been together for two years. Yesterday, we were visiting my family because we won't be able to be with them on Christmas, so we wanted to drop off some presents. It was also the first time that my boyfriend met my entire family, so it was kinda important.

Here's the thing, I forgot to tell them that my boyfriend is vegetarian, so my mom made a turkey and there wasn't really anything else to eat, beside some snacks. When I realized that, I quietly asked my boyfriend to please not cause a scene, and just eat the food and compliment my mom on it. He tried to argue back, saying that he doesn't wants to lie to my mom but I told him he would come across as rude if he didn't atleast tried it, and I didn't wanted him to make a bad impression. So he sucked it up, ate an entire plate and told my mom that it was delicious, which obviously made her happy.

We had a good evening and everyone seemed to like him, but when we drove back home he brought it up again and said he thinks it was kinda fucked up of me to expect him to eat meat, when I know how much it disgusts him. I get his point and I apologized to him, bit I still don't think that it's *that bad* to eat a bit of turkey once, to not make a weird first impression on my family. AITA?

edit: a few people are asking why there was nothing else that he could've eaten and like I said, there were of course some other snacks and a couple of different sauces, but nothing that would've been considered a decent meal without the turkey.

"I (47M) have a son (22M), who recently started dating another guy (22M). While he came out as bi since he was 15, he only dated girls before, so I was surprised to find out that he started dating a boy sometime ago, but I was still accepting of his relationship, even inviting him and his boyfriend over for dinner. My son accepted the invitation, but he warned me that his boyfriend has Tourette Syndrome and to try to ignore his tics. I promised him that I would because I didn't expect them to be too bad, but boy was I wrong. For almost the entirety of the dinner, his boyfriend just kept kicking his hand on the table and even spilled his drink on me. He apologized to me saying that this was one of his more severe days, but I was already getting fed up by all this. When he also started banging his foot on the floor and muttering noises under his breath, I just couldn't take it anymore and asked my son if he really thinks it's worth it settling down for this and that I think he deserves better. His boyfriend then looked down and tried to stay quiet ( but still muttering under his breath ), but my son gave a death glare and started pretty much scolding me, telling me how could I be so cruel and that I should be ashamed of myself, then he got up and him and his boyfriend left. I tried calling my son and gave him dozens of texts by now, but he still hasn't responded to any of them yet.

So AITA for saying and pretty much still thinking that my son deserves better ?

"Our daughter who just turned 10 does not yet have her ears pierced. This is extremely unusual in my husbands side of the family as all the girls tend to get their ears pierced as babies. My MIL and all my sisters in law have their have their ears pierced numerous times and it seems to be a tradition. All my nieces have at least 2 or 3 holes in each ear and some are even younger than my daughter.

My MIL has been asking when I will get my daughter's ears pierced ever since she was born. I told her I prefer to wait. She did back off for a while but the topic came up again recently as my daughter has started asking when she can get her ears pierced. I was considering allowing her to get it done but was thinking it might be a good gift when she becomes a teenager.

Word got out that my daughter wanted her ears pierced and my MIL jumped right on this. We had a birthday dinner for my daughter a couple weeks ago and my MIL said she had a very special gift. I have to say she was generous because there was a 2 pairs of gold earrings and a gift card for some accessories place that does ear piercing for $150. There was a note with the gif card saying that this was for ear piercings. My MIL then told her she can use this to catch up to her cousins and made a comment about how one of her aunties had like 5 piercings in each ear around the same age.

I was very annoyed because it appeared my MIL made the decision that my daughter could get her ears pierced. I told my MIL that $150 is a lot to get your ears pierced and she said my daughter can either get a expensive set of earrings but she would really prefer if she gets a few ear piercings so has something fun to appreciate with her cousins. This even frustrated me more because I felt my MIL was interfering is something that was not her business.

I later told my daughter I would rather her wait for her to get her ears pierced. She was disappointed but I said we will store way the earrings for later and we could use the voucher to buy some necklaces and bangles as well as some gifts to give to friends when we attend other parties.

Well my MIL visited us yesterday. She asked daughter if she had used her gift to get her ears pierced yet and my daughter show she hadn't and told how we ended up spending the gift card. I could here my daughter tell my MIL from the next room that she would like to get a few ear piercings but I wouldn't allow. My MIL got upset at how I abused her generous gift and started having a go at me about being overly uptight about just a few earrings. She also told me that she put a lot of thought in the gift and I was very ungrateful. She also said that if we weren't going to use it for the intended purpose I should have just returned it so she could use for my nieces. She ended up leaving early. AITA for not using the gift in the manner intended?

Additional info: My husband is on my MIL's side and telling me I should just accept his families tradition. I was 50/50 on the ear piercing thing but the gift angered me and may have caused me to decide to wait.",1
"My (40M) wife's (38F) official due date for our daughter is September 19, and this will be our first baby.

I work as an external auditor, and my job involves international travel. I had a non traditional education path so compared to my similarly junior coworkers I am quite a bit older and don't have the accolades and connections they may have. The perks of the job and the fact I work for a corporation many people interview at every year makes it easy for bosses to think they come first in your life and that we are under skilled and over paid. Therefore, I really want to show that I am a dependable worker and that if they are going to start ""cutting the fat"" so to speak, I will not be the one they are laying off.

While the job comes with a lot of perks, most of them are things we can only enjoy while working, like business class seats and nice free dinners when we travel or work after a certain time. The salary itself  makes it so that my wife still has to work at least part time if we want to raise a family in NYC, have savings, and still stay afloat. My wife currently is not working and I feel like we are just one monthly paycheck away from not being able to pay our mortgage. And while she has basically accepted that her job field is hostile towards mothers and that she'll be content with staying at the junior level she is at, I feel like I need to climb the corporate ladder ( which I am still about two rungs from the bottom) and prove myself to be indispensable. 

Work has had me in Europe for the past two weeks. One of the superiors with me is also my mentor who I really admire. I was supposed to fly home on Monday because they allowed me the next week and a half off. But he called me today and told me they really needed my help for something else for the next five business days. Days run late so my earliest flight out would be a sometime next Saturday afternoon. He said he'd be forever in my debt for this and that he'd fight for this to be reflected in my annual bonus. I sensed that he really would be really grateful and I've always been striving to earn his admiration, so after some thought, I agreed.

Now came the hard part and I called my wife to tell her. She was absolutely furious and cried over the phone saying she was already mad that this supposed family friendly firm sent me on this business trip but to extend it was insane. I told her that we'd be putting the extra bonus money in a college account and she could be happy to see it grow, but she refused to hear my reasoning. I told her I'd try to tell my mentor else had to close up the project and that I had to get a flight on Friday, but she started yelling that she could literally give birth tomorrow and called me a Neanderthal for not understanding. I told her it was for my career and our future. AITA? I feel like if I don't impress my higher ups somebody else will do so before I even walk on to a plane home.",1
"I (17F) recently got a truck. It was my dad’s old truck that I’ve wanted since I was little. My dad gave it to me after he was able to buy a different used vehicle for himself, one of those pick-up trucks with the big wheels and all that. Well, the other day, his window stopped working. It wouldn’t roll up or down, it actually started to slip down to where it stayed open. This is a problem because where we are, it rains quite a lot. 

Me and my dad are the only ones here that have vehicles as my mom is a SAHM and my little brother is too young to drive. He asked me if he could take my truck to work while his truck’s being repaired, but I told him no because I need to get to school and we have different schedules. He leaves for work two hours earlier than I do. I stay after school for an extra three hours so he gets home before me. He told me I could get a ride with a friend, but the closet friend lives 30 minutes away, and they wouldn’t be able to bring me home after school. I told him he could get a ride, but he said no one could. I’m not willing to wake up at four in the morning to take him to work anyway.

Well, yesterday morning I woke up and my truck was gone. I got a text from him saying that he called a friend of mine and that they’ll bring me to school and he’ll pick me up, but I’m pissed. I called him and he didn’t answer, so I left a very aggressive voicemail.

Anyway, last night dad had a dinner with his boss. His boss was asking about dad’s truck in the shop and saying how he was lucky he had an extra truck and such. I interjected here and said he was “lucky” that I didn’t call the police after he stole my truck. The room went very quiet and my mom called me out from the room.

After his boss left, dad came to me angry that I embarrassed him. I told him it was his own fault because he’s the one who stole my truck after I told him not to. Mom agrees with him though and now I’m grounded even though he’s the one who stole my truck. AITA??

Edit: Thank you to everyone who responded kindly. I’ve had a day to think and read your responses and I’ve realized what I did was very shitty. I apologized to my dad and sent a letter to his boss (with dad’s approval) to apologize as well. We’re going to have a talk about the truck later tonight in case something like this happens again. Thank you all.",1
"My grandma's sister(B) has ignored my grandma for about 5months.Blocked our numbers.All because of some miscommunication. It was nothing serious.
But to ignore someone and push them away over a small misunderstanding seems immature. My grandma has been in a rough place .
So B came to talk withher today and acted as if nothing was ever wrong between them.
I cant act like i was ok with her presence.
So i never once went out of my room to welcome and greet her.
Well she didn't greet me either.Grandma says that i humiliated and embarrassed her infront of her guest.
I dont think it was wrong of me to ignore B because of her actions towards my grandma.
So AITA for not greeting B?

Edit: 
Based on the comments recieved so far i seem to be the asshole.
Thank you for pointing out my mistakes.
The way i handled the situation was very immature and unnecessary .
And for the people who said that i am not the asshole.
Thank you for giving me your opinion .
I will be apologising to both of them

"GF and I were having dinner at a restaurant when she got a text from her best friend (who recently gave birth), and she said ""omg she got a C section."" she works as a nurse so she then explained to me the type of incision they make for that and how it'll leave a scar. I then, as a joke, said ""at least she'll still be tight down there."" My GF looked confused and then said that was a weird comment to make about her friend. I then said it is a very normal joke to make and she disagreed. TLDR there was some back and forth, i asked her to drop it and she kept trying to talk about it. I said to her ""youre so insecure"" and she then goes ""does it make you feel good to call me that?"" so then I got really frustrated, got up, and walked out of the restaurant and drove home. She called me several times (I drove both of us there) but I was so frustrated and just wanted to get home so I turned my phone off. She showed up at our apartment 30min later and was really pissed called me an asshole and over reacted, and that she waited in the cold for 20 min for an uber. Am i the asshole for walking out on her and leaving her there for being frustated?",1
"

My SIL, meaning my husband's sister, is the kind of person you'd call a dog mom. She and her fiancé don't have kids of their own yet and I don't think they'll have kids anytime soon since they're both 25 and they consider themselves young. That doesn't really matter though. The problem is the fact that they have 2 dogs already and they just got a 3rd dog.

When I found out I got pissed off. I don't care what she does in her own house and how many dogs she has but I get upset with the fact that whether she likes it or not her actions and dogs affects my family as well. I am a mother of 3 kids. Every Xmas and summer my husband and I go on vacation to his family's vacation house. His sister, her fiancé and their dogs are also there. Her getting another dog means that there's also another dog everytime we might come across each other at the vacation house. I don't hate dogs like many people do but I'm not a fan either and the fact that she didn't take into account how another dog would affect mine and my family's vacation at that vacation house everytime we come across each other pisses me off. I voiced my concerns to my husband and he later spoke to his mom and dad about it. His mom and dad scolded my SIL and her fiancé about how they can't keep getting pets without thinking of the rest of the family who doesn't like spending time with dogs whenever we are vacationing together. My husband and my in laws got in a heated fight with my SIL over this and my SIL called me crying and said I should be happy because she's never stepping foot in the vacation house again. She also reminded me how the vacation house is also hers and not just my husband's and my in laws since her name is on the house too and how I have a lot of nerve for basically kicking her out of her own property and causing a fight between her and her family.

My in laws and my husband said she'll get over it but that I shouldn't expect her to get rid of any dogs right now but that after the fight they're certain she won't get another dog ever again because of the shame she felt with that fight.

Part of me feels guilty over this but I also stood my ground and I'm glad I put a stop into this madness for once. AITA?",1
"The other night my boyfriend and I went to the gym like we usually do. This gym is usually open 24 hours during the week and closes early on the weekend. We went on a Saturday night, I thought the gym was open until 11 but apparently closed at 9 and was unaware of this.

After our workout we usually shower but the respective locker rooms. As I was finishing my shower I heard a man and a women talking in the locker room. They saw me in my towel and said ""we're closed, you need to get dressed and leave"" I just responded with a simple ok. However, I was taken aback by the fact that there was a man in the women's locker room and didn't announce he was coming in. 

About a minute later I heard screaming from the men's locker room. The girl who had come into the women's locker room with the guy was screaming at my boyfriend that he needed to ""get the fuck out"" ""I'm going to call the fucking cops"" ""you need to fucking leave"" ""get fucking dressed and get out"". At one point I heard her ask if he wanted to fight. 

When we left (around 9:07, 7 minutes after closing) I asked my boyfriend everything that happened and then expressed my uneasiness about the man just walking into the women's locker room and the woman into the mens'. He also told me he was changing his underwear when she kept coming in and screaming at him. 

There was no announcement to let us know the gym was closing in x amount of time and I believe this situation could have been handled way better. I'm posting this asking for advice and if you think the employees are in the wrong or if we are?",1
"I (27F) have been married to my husband (27M) for 5 years, together for 6 years. We met in college when we were 21 and dated for 8 months before he asked me to marry him and I said yes. Four months later we were married, on our one year dating anniversary. 

I have never met his parents. For the first 6 months of our relationship he would talk about them all the time, how they were great parents, how I was going to love them, they were going to love me, and all of that. And then, all of sudden, he told me he wasn’t on speaking terms with them anymore! I was very confused at the time and tried to get him to talk about it but no such luck. He just told me they had a fight, it wasn’t something he could forgive and that was that. 

I met most of his family at the wedding or during the preparations for it. I truly adore them. 

We were spending Christmas with his paternal grandparents (his parents were with his mother's parents, I think) when his cousin accidentally let slip why my husband fought with his parents: he told them he wanted to marry me and they accused me of being a gold digger (with more polite wording). Husband has confirmed this. 

Husband’s family does have a lot of money, the generational kind of wealth. And we did the whole meeting - getting engaged - getting married quite quickly to be fair to his parents! But the thing is: my family has more money than his family! And hubby knew it too! I would be a less than stellar gold digger if that was my intent.  

So upon learning what happened I thought it was amusing. Never in my life have I been accused of trying to social climb lol. Maybe if I had known at the time I would have been offended? But today I just find it funny. 

I told my husband he should contact his parents and try to mend their relationship. They were just worried for his sake. While I’m truly grateful he stuck by me and defended me so strongly, there is no need for that anymore. 

He didn’t want to hear it. At this point I was a little bit exasperated. His parents were worried and had no way to know better. I told him that and said it’s silly to stay NC with them after all this time for such a small offence. My honour has already recovered from learning what they said.

Well, he was upset about that last bit, saying it’s silly. Things have gotten back to normal since we last talked about it (yesterday morning). But I’m wondering: AITA? Should I apologise? I just think it makes no sense to throw away such a great parental relationship for something about me that I’m not even bothered with!",1
"So next weekend my FE friend is getting a little surprise bday party thrown for him. His gf is organizing the party, it's going to be just friends and family at his mom's house and a pretty friendly atmosphere. As a joke, but not really, I want to buy him a globe as a present. So WIBTA if I did that? He's pretty adamant about it being a flat earth and he will probably launch into some diatribe about his beliefs so I think I already know the answer, but hey that's my sense of humor and I also could see it as hilarious. Thoughts?

Edit: This is absolutely 100% not a troll or s/post whatsoever. I'm sorry some people have nothing better to do than to Spost or troll people, but that is not the case at all. If I didn't care about his friendship I would link to his FB so you can all see for yourself but I am not going to do that. I am friends with him because I know his whole family, I am friends with all of them from his mom to his uncles, brother, cousins and even his kids are friends with my kids. Our friendship is strong and he's not going to be butthurt and in his feelings over this he will tell me to Foff, maybe punch me in the arm and then move on. Anyways it's a small minority that think I shouldn't do it and that have no sense of humor, I am going to get him a real gift, not just the gag gift globe. And thanks for all the support and the people that still have a sense of humor in this day and age. It will be done and I will update, so click that save button or use the remind bot, party is Saturday so check back on Sunday. Peace, love and chicken grease, I'm out for now.

Update: I didn't video the unveiling, but it was funny AF! He was a little bit irritated about it, but he took it with humor he said who the F got me this a couple times to the crowd, I couldn't keep from busting up laughing and fessing up to doing it, he was like fuck u bud, lol'ing, then I gave him some wax and a blunt as the real gift, his mom gave him shit about being FE, and we all kinda clowned on him for a few mins,he took it great, talked shit back & his one conspiracy theory cousin was on his side, they pushed back a little bit but we all just joked and laughed and got on with the party. 10/10 highly recommend it to anyone who has a FE friend who has a sense of humor.",1
"So for a class discussion we had to do a short presentation on something we have a strong belief in. Could be religion, politics, etc. 

I (16M) am an atheist and chose Pastafarianism, which is the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster 👾 as my religion. 

The whole class was laughing except two students who were strict Muslim and Christian.

My teacher asked ""Are you just doing this as a joke or to prove some point?"" so I admitted I was. I then calmly explained why I thought religions such as Christianity and Islam were dumb, which made the two students look even angrier at me.

Teacher had a word with me after me class and said don't pull that shit again. I said okay, but it's still within my free speech to say all religion, especially monotheistic ones (Islam, Judaism and Christianity) are evil. My teacher is a Christian and he looked a bit pissed so said I need to stay on focus/topic.

As it stands, I already get good grades. His class is the one I don't take seriously tbh, mostly because of the nonsense subject matter on the module and partly because he's a Christian but I calmly explained my points AITA? ",1

My husband and I discussed this and said no. She's really upset because they don't have a substitute for him.

"A couple years ago when a friend bought a house, I bought them a housewarming gift worth $250-$300. Said gift has a specific purpose so I would know if they were using the gift but said friend definitely doesn't use said gift. I am hoping they brought it back and got something else more useful to them, but I don't know because I didn't ask. It was a gift and if they want it to sit in a closet untouched for 5.7 years, I feel like that is their choice.

About 10 mths ago, same friend bought me a $100 GC to a restaurant as a gift. They also offered to watch my dogs while I am out using the GC. While I appreciate the gesture, I just haven't got around to using the GC yet. My friend brings up the GC about once a month or so and keeps asking when I am going to use it. I respond by thanking them and point out how busy I am ( work fulltime and fulltime student.) I assure them I will use it and will let them know. (side note restaurant is about 40mins away)

I am started to get a bit frustrated by the pressure I am feeling to use the GC.

WIBTA if I brough up the housewarming gift to sort of get them off my back about using the GC?

&#x200B;

EDIT 1 - INFO  I have never been to the restaurant the GC is for so I am unsure if I will like it. The restaurant serves ethnic food I have never tried before. I am a person that likes things that are familiar, especially when it comes to food. I am picky and I have allergies (the life-threatening kind).  I guess it is fair to say that generally new restaurants do make me worry because of the allergies. Friend got me the GC because they said I need to get out more.

"My MIL has made a small ""family quilt"" for all of her kids and their spouses (5 couples including us). The quilt is really cute, has the couple's names, their kids' names, and their favorite hobbies and things all done in stitching and cute little cloth pictures. I was really looking forward to getting ours because I admit I'm a bit of a hipster and I love home-made kitschy stuff like that for our home.

She recently finished her latest one for my husband's brother and I thought we were getting ours soon since my husband is the youngest. I asked my SIL (she got hers first) and she very awkwardly informed me that no such quilt will be coming our way. I was a bit upset and asked my husband to investigate. Turns out MIL has no intention of making a quilt for us because there's not enough to put on all the squares or whatever, basically meaning since we don't have kids we don't deserve a quilt because she can't be bothered.

I message her directly about it because I'm just that kind of person. I like hearing it straight from the other guy. MIL says her fingers hurt after the first 4 quilts and she's taking a break. I ask her if it has anything to do with the fact that we have no kids (which she expressed negativity against in the past) and she says no even though I know it's a lie. I push her more and ask her when she thinks the quilt will be done after her little ""break"" and she kind of loses her temper and says there's no quilt and there never will be a quilt.

I ask why and she says she's only interest in making quilts with her grandkids and things on them and we don't have enough hobbies and kids' hobbies to fill up a whole quilt. I tell her we have 2 beautiful dogs whom we love and could be put on there and she says ""I'm not making a whole quilt for a couple of goddamn dogs"" verbatim. I hang up and tell my husband and he's 100% on my side.

But now I got a really mean voice message from my SIL telling me that I crossed the line and am acting like a huge B\*tch for no reason. I'm shocked because I have a great relationship with my SIL and she always defended me from other family bullshit. My husband wants no part in this now. AITA for what I said to my MIL?",1
"Throwaway because some of my family follows my main.

I (F27) am a single mom to three kids; 5, 3, and 2. My ex-husband left soon after my youngest was born and has since moved out of state. 

I am close with my brother (M32) and have tried to get close to his wife (F26). She is very sweet and fun, and I genuinely enjoy her company. I obviously don't get to hang out with her a lot because I have my hands full. My family helps out occasionally with childcare but they are all busy too so I don't get a lot of time with my friends.

My SIL has invited me along with her friend group frequently. They are all very outdoorsy and like to have a good time. The thing is, I have to decline 9.9/10 times because the activities they plan are not child friendly. Day-long hikes, wineries, kayaking trips down large rivers; you get the idea. Plus my SIL doesn't seem that interested in kids. She never helps or offers to help keep an eye on the kids during family gatherings. She isn't rude when I turn down the invites. She just says she understands and hopes I can join them next time.

We had a Barbeque a couple weeks ago at my parents house. I was chatting with my brother and SIL and she mentioned she and her best friend were going to head to a very fancy art museum out of town. She asked if I'd like to join them and I said I would have to see. She nodded and said she understood. 

It was then I mentioned it would be great if she and her friends did stuff the kids could do once in a while. My SIL got a little awkward and said that none of her friends had kids and this is just what they liked to do. We continued talking but it was a little quiet and she excused herself.

My brother told me that it was an asshole move to make a suggestion like that because she was trying to include me in her friend group and I don't have a right to change their vibe. I feel guilty now, but it's just really difficult to get out with three young kids.",1
"I (14F) and my best friend (14F) who we’ll call May, had been friends since we first started High School in year seven, we were best friends until around the end of year nine when May got close with someone who we’ll call Carrie, and we became a trio (I didn’t mind as I too became just as close to Carrie) The new year had passed so we went into year ten. 

On the second day we were back at school, we had to collect our devices, and since we were in the same house as one of our other close friends, all four of us waited to collect the laptops, while sitting in a line on one step. Our friend (We’ll call her Ginny) turned to face us all and said 

“Hey, do you think we will get actual dates for the ball, or just go as a friend group?” 

As soon as the words left her mouth, May clapped her hands together and said 

“Hah, sorry guys!” In a cocky voice. 

I didn’t think much of it, and since we had been friends for so long, and she had told me things about her and her boyfriends relationship that she hadn’t told ANYONE else, I decided to joke with her and say “If it lasts.” I didn’t mumble. I didn’t scoff. I said it in a playful, joking way since she hadn’t had any problems with it in the past. 

When I said that, May turned to look me dead in the eyes, with a genuinely disgusted face and said “Why would you say that.” My insides suddenly felt funny. “It’s just because you’re alone.” 

Those words hit me hard. I had always found comfort in May when telling her I wish someone loved me and cared for me that deeply, so when she said that, all my trust for her evaporated. 

Some part of me understands why she got defensive, I suppose she is sensitive about people doubting her relationship as she believes they will be together until death do them part or something, or maybe she thought I was serious. Carrie immediately started saying things like “Woah!” Directed at me, defending May. 
Ginny stayed quiet while May and Carrie immediately started talking me down, saying that her and her boyfriend were everything and I wasn’t even close to that, they were saying it in a joking way, but I knew May was genuine. 

It hurt knowing she didn’t care for me as much as I thought she did, but It didn’t make sense since if May and her boyfriend were involved in something, nobody else mattered. I clarified that I was joking straight after she basically threw away my trust, but I suppose she was too sensitive in that moment. 
Please, I need to know if I was the a hole.

Edit: me and may had become verrryyy close so we could tell each other everything, joke about everything, (she would even say things that I was sensitive about but I never thought too much of it) so when I said that as a joke I expected her to act like she had done all the times before. 
It was only the end of year 9 that our friend Carrie came and became very close with May as well. Not meaning to seek for empathy or anything but I became a third wheel when I was with the both of them. I’d constantly try to fit into what they were saying, never being serious and always trying to have a laugh. 
I genuinely thought May was going to laugh at the joke because it was so insane and unimaginable. I’m not jealous of May and her boyfriend, I admire them. There is a difference. If I wear to have a relationship I wouldn’t want it like theirs, I’m my own person and don’t get jealous about things Iike that. 
I had texted May many times and spoken to her in person a lot of times, expressing my sadness for not having someone who I can act a certain way with. I actually started to feel insecure at times so saying something about me being alone is very angering but also made me more insecure. I hope the comments won’t start coming at me for imaging May as my best friend when she doesn’t think the same way about me.

Update: May said another comment about me being single that again made me feel very agitated and insecure. She said that I didn’t have a boyfriend to share my soup with or something so I said something that I knew would make her question it, I said ‘if the bf that you think I want is like your boyfriend then I’m okay being single for life.’ I know it was a bit mean, but she should be glad I’m not going after her man. 

She asked what was wrong with her boyfriend and I said he was not for me and that since I could see she was getting agitated let’s not make jokes about each others love life’s. She said okay but I still didn’t feel like she really got what I meant and so I called her out on it and said how she is always saying things about me not being in a relationship and as soon as I say one thing about her she bashes me. 

She wound up apologising and saying she didn’t mean to make me feel that way and that she didn’t realise, this was a very mature thing for her to do and I’m glad she saw where she was wrong. I ended the conversation by saying (word for word) “I tried letting you know that I was joking so I hope u know now that id never say it seriously” 

I find the comments calling me rude for saying what I said in the first place which could have been rude if we weren’t friends. But we are. 

I’m not attached nor jealous of her, she is her own person and she has matured greatly from being someone who used to pick on my insecurities (physically too) to being a shoulder I can cry on for things like my body, acne, family issues and other things. She has grown up to be the opposite of what she was and I’ll always admire her for it, not be jealous, but admire. The comments seem rude but I understand your opinions, I just hope you can see it from my side as you have already seen it from hers.",1
"I'm in a Christian family, and my SIL's stillbirths hit her hard. 

* We'll call my dad ""Ralph"", and his father ""Tony""

* The first stillbirth, we'll call her ""Dianne"", happened at 9 months. This was 7 years ago.

* The second stillbirth, we'll call her ""Sarah"", happened at 6 months. This was 4 years ago.

Regardless, she has had 4 successful births, currently aged 1,3,6, and 9. They're a happy family together, and have not forgotten their unborn children. They held memorial services for both, for the immediate family. She has gotten tattoos of their footprints on their own feet, and can't wait to get to heaven to finally meet them.

My brother feels similarly, but that's mostly because of his choice to support and comfort her through both losses. They're his daughters too, and could've moved on, but it hit his wife hard so he went through that journey with her.

As far as my dad goes, I'm positive he was not impacted so harshly. He was definitely there to console them in their loss, and was briefly sad that he wouldn't get to meet new granddaughters. But, he made years of happy memories of his 5 living grandchildren.

My SIL wrote this in the draft of his obituary:

> Ralph is preceded in death by his father Tony and granddaughter’s Dianne and Sarah.

My SIL has been very open about her losses on Facebook, and everyone in her circles knows about them and knows they're truly lost family to her. However, my dad's circles and my SIL's circles do not overlap so neatly. There's people that know my dad that have never met my SIL.

My worry is that the sentence will be a negative conversation starter that pulls the focus away from remembering my father: ""oh my goodness, Ralph had two granddaughters that passed away?!"". 

WIBTA if I tell her to remove the mention of her stillborn daughters from my dad's obituary?",1
"My (20F) brother (26M) got kicked out by our parents at 18 because he dropped out of high school and refused to work. Our parents gave him three days after his birthday to leave, and told him not to contact them for money or to ask them to change their minds. He didn't contact us for four years, which is when he had my niece, and told our parents they'd never get to meet her.

He kept his word, and to this day our parents have never met their granddaughter. He had contact with me though, he'd pick me up to visit sometimes, but that stopped when I was 18 and still said I supported what my parents did. He's married now, and he does welding or something along those lines, So I think getting kicked out was the best thing that could've happened to him.

To this say he has never said a word to our parents, and has told my niece that they're dead. He refuses to attend any family gathering if they're there, and never brings his family. He makes post online about how parents who kick their kids out at 18 are terrible, and how he'll never do the same.

I had enough of him disrespecting the people who took care of him, so I went over there to ""visit"" and lost it at him. I said he deserved to get kicked out for being a lazy freeloading brat, and his daughter wouldn't exist if he hadn't been. I accused him of hating our parents for being right more than he loves his daughter. He told me to get out and not come back, and said that I'm just like our parents.

I don't think I was wrong, but my BF said that I'm rubbing salt in the wound, and making things worse for no reason.",1
"A friend of my wife's invited my family - my wife (29F), our son (5M), and I (26M) - over for dinner with him (30M) and his daughter (5F). As long as we've known him, this friend has kept to a very strict diet, which has almost always led to us eating over at his place, but he is an excellent cook so I've never minded. We have not, however, seen him since both of our children were infants.

For dinner, we were served salmon with quinoa and arugula. My son is very mild for a 5-year-old - he throws tantrums very rarely and is the opposite of a picky eater, but I could tell from how he was acting that he was not vibing with this meal. He was picking at his plate, shuffling food, and while he did try the salmon, he didn't seem to like it. I asked him if he was happy with his dinner and he said no, he wasn't. 

I basically said, ""Haha, kids, right?"" and asked if there was anything else for my son to eat. My wife's friend said that his daughter just eats whatever he makes, so he doesn't keep ""kid food"" around the house. 

My wife said it was fine, our son would be fine. While he is a mild kid, he definitely gets hangry and this was the beginning of our night, so we anticipated being there for an additional hour or two. I said that our son needed to eat so he'd have energy to play and apologized, saying I'd be gone for just a few minutes, picking something up for our kid. My wife's friend seemed irked, but said he'd try and keep my plate warm.

I was gone for about 30 minutes, came back with a Happy Meal - ordered extra fries in case his daughter wanted any, which she was not allowed to have. By the time I was back, dinner was winding down. My son ate his meal, we had dessert, and he went off to play with his friend.

It was definitely a hiccup in the night, but things went fine. We had a good time, but my wife was definitely cold with me. When we got home (3 hours after dinner), she told me that I was an ass at dinner for no reason. I pointed out that if I hadn't gotten our son dinner, he would've been a monster the entire way home, to which she replied that we would've left earlier. I said I was just looking to solve the problem as it happened and that if her friend had been more accomodating, we wouldn't have been in the situation in the first place.

She got offended on his behalf and we decided to just go to bed because we clearly were not getting anywhere. It's been two days since, things are still stilted between us, and I'm not sure where I went wrong.

AITA for leaving dinner to get my son food, even though dinner was served?",1
"I (20/f) have a small group of friends and recently a new guy joined us (Jack). Jack is pretty friendly & cute but he has the most SEVERE stutter I’ve ever heard in my life. Tbh, it’s tiring to deal with it. My friends really like him and put up with his speech but I find it extremely difficult. 

Whenever we all hang out and he talks, I just finish the sentence for him if he’s taking especially long to get there. For example he’ll say “I w-w-ent h-h-h-o-“ and I’ll say  “—home?”. My friends told me to stop doing that and told me in private that I’m embarrassing/ hurting Jack. However from what I’ve seen he doesn’t seem to mind it at all.

Btw Jack and I text each other and he asked me on a few occasions if I want to hang out 1 on 1 (probably Cos we have similar hobbies). The thing is, his stutter is 1000x times worse when he talks to me directly. There’s no way I can put up with that for more than 2 minutes. So I declined each time and he told me it’s fine.  

Anyway a couple of days ago Jack was super excited and telling us that he won a prize in some writing competition he entered. But as you know, it took him a **LONG** time to tell us he won. So I basically finished his sentence while he broke the news which is apparently the worst thing I could’ve done. Literally all of my friends yelled at me to “SHUT UP” at the same time. 
  
I was verbally attacked by everyone which was so hurtful that I just left. I had no bad intentions yet everyone is acting like I’m such a horrible person. Jack actually reached out to me and said that he doesn’t want me to be upset. Well I’m very upset but don’t know if I’m truly the asshole or not.",1
"Last saturday, we had friends come over for a game night. There was 17 people in our appartment. We bought 200$ worth of hors d'oeuvres such as eggrolls, small pastries with meat or cheese and some chips. As the main dish I asked my aunt to cook us her special macaroni in the over, chicken wings and nuggets. There was so much food, everyone left with a plate. Sunday we ate out of the leftovers but there was still enough food to eat for the rest of the week (there was a lot of food).

She works from home and I from an office. Sunday night she packed the food in the fridge. I noticed monday morning that there was less macaroni than what was left the previous day (meaning she ate during the night). I'm the type that doesn't like to eat heavy at lunch otherwise it makes me sleepy so I made sandwiches for lunch thinking I'm goin to eat some macaroni, wings and pastries for supper. Monday 7pm when I go to the fridge, all the pastries and chicken wings are gone! At the same time my sister came over to do my girlfriend's hair and I asked :''Honey did you pack the hors d'oeuvres somewhere else, I can't find them?'' She replied there was none left. I didn't want to make a scene in front of my sister so I took a plate of macaroni. The next day (tueday) she made me a steak with veggies for lunch and in the afternoon I had a seminar with paid dinner so I didn't eat none of the leftovers. Then comes wednesday, I had sandwiches for lunch again but when I got home I was hungry, went to the fridge and realised there was no food left. She ate everything, that mountain of food we had for a week is gone.

That's when I snapped and told her she didn't leave me any. At first she denied eating everything but I told her we're only two here, I only ate a plate when my sister came on monday. Then she said she thought I had taken my share. I told her clearly no. Then she replies there's no use being mad for food when we can just go and buy more. I'm just being petty. I told her it doesn't make sense that you ate all this food in 3 days and that you didn't even notice that I didn't have any. It's easy to say that it's just food when you ate it all.

Now she's mad at me apparently for yelling at her and being too old, (I'm 36), to react like this. I'm 6''1' and 205 and she's 5''8', 185. During the last two years, she gained at least 40 lbs while I've stayed the same. I'm seeing red right now and have no one to vent my anger because I don't want people I know to see her in a bad light. Am I an asshole or not? Please pass judgement upon me.",1
"My girlfriend [30] doesn't live with me [35] yet. And she's very hesitant to at this point. I get where she's coming from as she's not a night owl like me and my kids. But for her to tell me how to parent made me rather angry with her. I have 2 kids with the ex wife. They're 4 and 10. I've tried morning routines in the past but they NEVER worked. My kids don't naturally get tired until midnight (and sometimes not until 1am) so I allow them to stay up until then. Despite their very late bedtime, they still technically get enough sleep per day. I'll get them up for school around 7am and when they're at school, I'll take a long nap. When they get back, they'll take a 3-5 hour nap, which totals to 9-12 hours of sleep per day. The 10 year old is doing great in school and the 4 year old is fine too so I see no reason to change things. This is their routine/preference as well as mine. They're night owls just like me. I've tried to get them to sleep earlier before but they rarely fall asleep earlier than midnight.

My girlfriend on the other hand gets tired around 9-10pm and goes to bed then when visiting me for a few days at a time. She has an issue with my kids still being up after she's gone to bed. She says she can still hear them up even though my bedroom (that I let her sleep in) door is closed when she goes to bed. She has to be up in the morning too, but unlike me and my kids, she has difficulty taking naps and thus goes to bed earlier than the rest of us. I personally don't have a problem if/when I fall asleep before my kids do because I can sleep through anything and I work from home.

She recently told me I need a better routine for my kids. I got mad at her for telling me how to parent when she has no kids of her own and it's my house. Now she wants to visit even less. I tried getting her to understand that my family is filled with night owls. It's just the way my kids and I are. They still get plenty of sleep thanks to the long naps they take after school/preschool. AITA for getting mad at her? I did raise my voice a bit but as a parent, I'd rather not be told how to raise my kids when my parenting has been working (and therefore doesn't need changing). I also grew up with extremely strict parents who put so many rules when I was a kid, including an early bedtime, that not only did I eventually become very depressed from it but I would lay in bed for hours without even falling asleep (because I've always been a night owl). I don't want to subject my kids to that.",1
"For this youll need context on my family. We say some pretty fucked up shit in good fun about eachother. E.g Ill (23m) tell my brother (20m) that he's mums a whore then he will argue back along the lines of ""na ah, my ma's an angle your mum is the whore"" or something like me sayin ""your older brother (me) is dumb as fuck"" then he will say something like ""nah my brother is smart, your little brother is the dumb as fuck one. Our mum knows all about this and is in fact where we get this quirk from so she will even join in. 

Our sister (22f) had a friend over yesterday. At some point me and my brother got into an ""argument"" while playing COD going back and forth saying the others mother is a whore (we have the same mum btw lol). Our sisters friend heard then started berating us for disrespecting our ""mothers"" (we only have the one lol). I told her to mind her own fucking business and that we arent doing it out of direspect. Mum must of heard all this and shouted down the hallway ""those gremlins can call me a whore all they want, it wont stop me fucking their dad"".

I guess our mum joining in like that embaressed her and now my sister is calling me an asshole for even saying anything and ""getting"" mum to join in since now her friend refuses to hang out with her at our place. AITA?",1
"I am drafting the wedding invitations, and I am struggling with the introduction. 

My parents are paying for the entire wedding ($15,000), and my fiancé’s parents are paying for the rehearsal dinner. Because of that I would like to recognize my parents by using the traditional introduction of “Mr. and Mrs. X request the pleasure of your company at the marriage of their daughter A to B.” 

However, I do not want to offend my fiancé’s parents and make it seem like I am excluding them. I am so grateful for what they are contributing both in finances and in support, so I am also considering “Mr. And Mrs. X and Mr. And Mrs. Y request the pleasure of your company at the marriage of A and B.” 

Because of the extreme disparity in contribution I would like to recognize my parents, but I don’t want to punish my fiancé’s family for their inability to contribute equally. What should I do?",1
"Last weekend my (34m) wife (35f) received an invitation to her eldest sister's wedding. The invitation states that she and our three children are invited with no mention of me e.g ""4 seats have been reserved in honor of wife, child, child, and child"". 

I was insulted and thought my wife would agree that that is rude but after she spoke to her mother to clarify if I really wasn't invited she said she is still planning to attend. I said it wouldn't be fair for her to go without me and that I don't give consent for my children to go without their father. She said I'm being unreasonable as her nieces and nephews will be there and it's a big family event. 

My argument is that if it's so important the whole family attends then I should be invited. If not then it can't be that important and she shouldn't go. Who's the asshole here?

ETA okay I get it I'm in the wrong, I'll let my kids go. Everyone can stop hounding me about old mistakes that I've already thoroughly repented for.",1

"Eight months ago my (26F) big sister (31F) got a new job in a place she loves and has a job she throughly enjoys. From day one of working there she became best friends with this girl who's the same age of her and they have the same interests. They're also both married and have a son each who is born a week apart. 

Five months ago it was my BIL 40th birthday so my sister decided to invite her best friend round to meet her family for the first time. Here's the thing, I dated her best friend. 

Looking back now I realised I made a lot of mistakes and should have stayed single but I was raised a Conservative Christian which I still am but I realised I was bisexual and I spent ages coming to terms with it. I dated my ex for nine months in secret which is why she broke it of and my cheating. I dated her during the time I was struggling to terms with my sexuality and I know I'm an asshole for my cheating and there's no excuse for it. 

Her best friend didn't reveal to my sister that we dated but I had a feeling she would after and I thought she would have done by now. 

This week her best friend revealed that we dated a long time ago (four years ago) and she told the whole truth about our relationship. My sister came round yelling at me for not telling the truth even though I tried explaining that I thought she knew.

"I, \[23F\] have a friend Sarah \[24F\]. Recently Sarah has gained some weight, and so brought some new clothes. I met her this week and she was complaining about how she had tried on a dress and it hadn't fit, however she wasn't able to return it as she had waited a day too long.

I agreed that was annoying, but the dress looked cute and I didn't think it should go to waste, so I offered to buy it from her. She agreed, it was a little big in places but I really liked how it looked and it's probably one of my favorite dresses.

On Friday Sarah was hosting a birthday party for her boyfriend Sam \[25M\], most of the other girls were wearing dresses, I decided to wear the dress I brought from Sarah as no one else has seen it yet and it was cheaper than buying a new dress.

Before I left I took a photo with some of the other girls who were coming, Sarah messaged me asking if I could please not wear that, turns out she hadn't brought it from the shop, it was actually a gift from Sam and she didn't want to tell him that it didn't fit. This dress was much more expensive then she had told me and come from a specific designer. At this point we were all about to get in my friends car, and I wasn't about to tell them to wait for me, so I just went and acted like I hadn't seen the message.

When we got there, Sarah took me aside and told me she would give me a lift home to change, I said no and she told me to leave. At this point I was annoyed, I said it was Sam's birthday and if he had an issue he could say. Later that evening he complimented the dress and said it was just like one he had brought Sarah not that long ago for their anniversary, at that point she said she wasn't feeling well and went upstairs.

She messaged me this morning calling me a b\*tch and an assh\*le, I feel like I should've been more considerate, AITA?

***IMPORTANT EDIT CLARIFYING SOME THINGS:***  
For those asking why I didn't get changed, I did not have another suitable dress currently ready (two were in the wash after a night out), all I had suitable was some jeans and a nice shirt, however every other girl was wearing a dress and I didn't want to be singled out, plus the girls I was going with would ask questions.

For those asking why I didn't leave her house, it's also Sam's house and he had no problems with me being there.  


Those those claiming I like Sam, I am a lesbian, so no.",1
"I'm 24M I was supposed to spend Mother's Day with my mom. My mother, who is 45 years old, was battling cancer and going through chemo, so she didn't want to celebrate until she was feeling better. Meanwhile, my girlfriend, Rose, who is 28 years old, had a stillborn birth that hurt her deeply. To support her, I promised to do Mother's Day with her every year.

Last year, my mom's cancer went into remission, but after Mother's Day had passed. She said that when Mother's Day came around this year, she wanted to have a mother-son day together, which I agreed to. However, Rose was feeling lonely and didn't want me to leave and wanted to spend the day together, so I decided to spend the day with her instead. I know that this hurt my mother's feelings, and my sister said it was a screwed up thing to do.

My dad said that my mom would need some time to get over it, but it was his birthday yesterday, and my mom said that she didn't want me to come over because she's still mad that I missed Mother's Day. My friends are split on whether I'm the asshole or not. Some think my mom is being petty, while others think I messed up and should apologize. I'm not sure what to do next, as I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.

EDIT:So after the astounding ytas's and reading the comments I sat rose down and explained why Mom was mad she started crying saying she didn't mean to make me miss mother's day so I hugged her and told her it'll be all right. 

My mother I went to her house and knocked on her door for 10 minutes until she finally opened and explained why I didn't come she  said she understands the trauma did to her but she almost died but fought through the pain because she loves me, my sister, and dad so she said she wants me at the house next Monday we are spending the entire day together use a sick day if I have too",1
"Created a throw away account because too many of my Friends frequent reddit. So my fiancé and I have been planning a wedding for 2 years. His sister unexpectedly got pregnant and she told us the due date is 3 weeks after the wedding. While she said she is having a healthy pregnancy and would be fine to participate in the events I am not comfortable with it and am insisting she just be a spectator. The problem with this is she is his only sibling and they have a very close relationship. This decision has caused tension between her and my fiancé. Another problem is that the bridesmaids dresses I selected from David’s bridal don’t come in maternity sizes. I’m not trying to to offensive but she seems to be very offended. I am just wondering why she doesn’t understand this decision wasn’t made to slight her.

"I (34M) and my wife (31F) are expecting a child in 12 weeks time. We don't know the sex of the baby but we've started thinking about baby names. A couple of nights ago we were suggesting names. I had a girlfriend for around 6 years before meeting my now wife. Unfortunately she passed away and I was absolutely devastated. It's still painful to think about and I always imagined naming a child in her memory. I also just love the name itself (Nancy). When I made the suggestion to my wife she seemed unimpressed. She told me she didn't really feel comfortable with doing that. She felt it was strange and didn't make sense as Nancy had been my girlfriend. The way I see it is that Nancy was very important to me for a really long time. She was my best friend and losing her was just a terrible thing. I feel as though it would be a great way to remember and honour a dear friend who I miss everyday.  My wife doesn't share my views and honestly its caused a lot of issues. I dropped it and said it was important we both agreed on the name but she's still insisting it's strange and she doesn't understand why I suggested it. I don't know if she feels insecure or maybe the pregnancy is stressing her but she just won't drop it. I honestly don't see the issue whatsoever. AITA?


I just thought I'd put a quick edit/disclaimer/update here if anyone was interested. It seems like most people have said that I'm wrong in this situation which is understandable. I think I'll apologise again and hopefully the situation will end there. It probably was a weird idea and maybe I wasn't seeing that clearly as I'm still grieving to some extent. I also just wanted to make it clear that myself and Nancy weren't together when she passed. Nancy passed around two years after we separated but we had decided to stay friends. I met my wife around 2 months before Nancy and I separated. I probably should have mentioned that in the original post but maybe it doesn't make much of a difference. Anyway thanks for the feedback.",1
"Throwaway acct for anonymity. 

My (27M) friend (24M) and his wife have been married for 3 years and have two small babies. 

Recently, another woman reached out to his wife to tell her that a few years back while they were living in separate states (he was in the military) they slept together. 

This has caused a great deal of havoc to their marriage and things have been super tense. 

However, the wife has been extremely toxic lately and although I understand she is hurt, she is taking advantage of this situation to get her way on everything. 

Most recently, she basically guilt tripped my friend into buying an expensive cat because in her words she “deserves it”. They already have 5 other cats and two small babies, and not a lot of economic resources to add another expensive cat into the mix. 

My buddy agreed as a way to keep the peace. He’s trying to save his marriage, but at what cost? She’s doing whatever she wants (leaving him the kids to go out late, making him do extra work around the house even though he works a very physical job, and now the whole cat situation). 

I told my wife the situation and how I think she’s being unreasonable but my wife says that his wife is probably very hurt and isn’t dealing well with all the emotions that come from finding out he cheated. 

As I said, I can empathize, but this is no excuse to treat my friend like dirt. There’s a healthy and unhealthy way to deal with the situation, and she’s choosing the unhealthy way to go about it and causing more damage. 

My wife is now mad at me… she said she will take the wife’s side on everything and support her in whatever she needs. He’s the one that messed up after all, and he needs to deal with the consequences of his actions. She says he SHOULD give her whatever she wants…. But where do you even draw the line? When will he stop paying for a mistake from years ago?? 

This has now created a rift between me and my wife… but I don’t think I’m being TA here for taking my friends side. Look, I know what he did was awful, but two wrongs don’t make a right and she’s just being spiteful and selfish, getting her way in everything she wants and guilting him into big decisions that will only hurt their family even more.",1
"Some background: I have 4 kids. My eldest John (27M), was with my first wife who died when he was 5. I eventually remarried and got two step-daughters, Lisa (25F) and Ann (18F). Then my second wife and I had Mike (13M). My wife and I made sure to give them comfortable lives. When John and Lisa graduated from university, we gifted them condo units. We will do the same when Ann and Mike graduate. Also, all of them have trust funds that will be released when they turn 30.

I’m quite proud of my kids. John and Lisa graduated from top universities. John has a high-paying job as an engineer while Lisa pursued a master’s degree in business while she worked in marketing. Eventually, she started her own marketing consulting firm while being a part-owner of a spa.

John recently got engaged to his girlfriend of 2 years and they want to get married by the end of this year. She seems nice. However, she doesn’t earn as much as him. My son spends a lot of money on her, on dates and expensive gifts. I understand that it’s his money and he can spend it however he wants. She also moved in with him in the condo that I gave him, and as far as I know, she doesn’t pay her share of utilities and association fees. And now John is asking to get part of his trust fund so he could use it for the wedding since his fiancee doesn’t have much money to contribute for their wedding.

Now here’s where I might be the asshole. I told him I’d release part of his trust fund early if he draws up a prenup with her. He got angry and told me I was being unfair because I released half of Lisa’s trust fund last year to help put up her business. He told me that I was playing favorites. I told him that Lisa did something worthwhile with her trust fund, and while a wedding is worthwhile, I told him it doesn’t seem safe to use his fund for a wedding to a girl “who doesn’t bring much to the table”. I told him that I just wanted him to have some security by drawing up a prenup. He got angrier and said I was implying that his fiancee is a gold-digger.

My wife and the rest of the family refuse to take sides. AITA?

&#x200B;

**EDIT TO UPDATE:**

 The next day after I posted, I had a long conversation with my son. 

First, I apologized to him for making that comment about his fiancee. I realized it was demeaning and uncalled for.

Second, I asked about their living arrangement. He did admit to paying for everything including bills and food. She does the cooking sometimes. He even pays for someone to clean because neither of them wouldn’t. I asked if she ever offered to pay, he said no. I understand it’s none of my business but the fact that she never offered is raising some flags in my head. 

I gave him some things to think about, and maybe discuss with her, like what would happen if he loses his job or for some reason (illness/accident), he has to stop working. I told him that I have nothing against their arrangement and him spoiling her, but he has to be wiser about his spending habits. 

Third, I explained the importance of a prenup and said that I had one with his mom and his stepmom. He still refuses to because according to him “it might offend her”. Again raising some flags. So I will stick to my decision and release his trust fund when he’s 30, as we initially agreed on. He wasn’t happy with this.

Lastly, I asked what kind of wedding they plan to have that they felt the need to use his trust fund. Apparently, she dreams of having a big wedding on the beach. She also wants to have a photo and video production to announce their engagement (which I find ridiculous). They want it this year but can’t afford it, as she is only paying for her wedding dress, and my son admitted that he doesn’t have a lot of savings (probably from going on expensive dates and trips). I told him that it’s not practical, but if they really want it, they should wait and save up for it. 

At that point, I was feeling better about my decision to not release his trust fund early. The way I see it, my son could go broke in a few years paying for everything and spoiling his fiance/wife. Their trust fund is the last thing all my kids will get from me.

That being said, I may be an asshole but not a total asshole to not support his wedding. My wife and I agreed to give them a certain amount that should cover a nice venue, and still have some leftover amount left for other expenses. It will be our wedding gift to them. And if he’s still not happy, then there’s nothing more I can do.

If they go NC or low contact, I’d still feel at peace with my decision. I provided for him and I tried to protect him. If she leaves him and he ends up losing everything, I’d hate for that to happen but that’s on him. But I do hope their marriage works out.",1
"**It has been a day and my daughter has still not even bothered to respond back to me. I am not going to just take this disrespect. I have received so many messages making assumptions about what kind of a father I was and attacking me for not enabling a disrespectful adult. I hope you all enjoy handing out thousands of dollars every year to support the education of an adult who can't even bothered to give you the time of day after you've done everything for them. Thank you to the few mature and reasonable people who understand that I am not required to enable a disrespectful adult child. I've appreciated your public and private messages.**

I want to start off by saying that I have done everything for my children. I was there at the hospital for their births, signed the birth certificates, I changed diapers and always provided them with food and designer clothes. But my ex is extremely manipulative and has tried to turn my children against me since day one.

She manipulated my older daughter who refused to talk things out with me. I will still forgive her once she finally decides to snap out of my ex’s manipulations and come back to me. Me and my younger daughter “Sarah” had a great relationship until she suddenly flipped the switch in her senior year and also was poisoned against me.

When “Sarah” was applying for college I really didn’t want her to go far because she has book smarts but lacks common sense and I didn’t want her to fall for scams. I even offered to buy her a car if she lived with me and commuted to a local school. But Sarah just said that the local programs didn’t have what she wanted. I found it insulting because I went to a local college and despite what my ex thinks, I am highly educated without some PhD.

Sarah did not listen to my input at all. Her and my ex barely involved me in her college application process. My ex was extremely unhelpful. I would just ask basic questions like tuition since I was going to spend considerable funds, and she would either send website links. It would have only taken a few seconds for her to just answer the question so I can stay in the loop about what’s going on. But this was just part of my ex’s way of turning Sarah against me. Sarah enrolled at an out of state college and I didn’t even find out until May because my ex didn’t bother telling me. I didn’t even get to see Sarah off at the airport since she didn’t tell me she’d left until after she was already gone.

I constantly text Sarah asking how things are going. I send her funny posts on Facebook and ask her to call me. I even offered to split the cost of planefare so Sarah could visit over the holidays. She only responds on email and it’s always her saying she’s too busy.

I am frustrated and tired of this. She is taking a lot of classes right now but I’m her father and it would only take a second of her day to just text me back or talk to me on the phone for five minutes. I have supported and been providing for Sarah since day one. I am done being disrespected when I have bent over backwards for 18 years to give her everything and have sent $7,000 just this year for her schooling. I could be doing a million other things with that money. Maybe I am at fault for enabling it for so long but not anymore. I sent an email telling her that I am done with being disrespected and if she can’t even give me the time of day then my ex can find someone else to split the cost of her schooling with. I sent the email over two hours ago and there’s been no response. I know my wording might seem harsh but I am just so done with being disrespected. AITA?",1
"Asking because I feel like I would be, but also because I think what’s happening is kinda bs. 

So my partners sister (30F) runs a side hustle from her home. Her husband (32) works full time, and as far as the tax man knows, she’s a SAHM. Except she has a full set up business running out of her house, doing beauty treatments on people. She has a socmed business page, a website and everything, and takes organised bookings. She charges market rates (sometimes more) for her services, and asks outright for cash in hand. 

I dont normally go to her, but on this occasion I decided to book in just because my regular beauty therapist was unavailable. I don’t carry cash, so I asked her if it was ok if I used bank transfer. She said it was fine but label the transfer as ‘lunch’. 

When I asked her a bit more about why, she said it was so she didn’t have to pay tax on her earnings. Per my partner, it’s generally well known that she doesn’t. She stashes the cash and they only pay tax on his income. 

I feel like this is pretty crappy. We all ought to pay our share of taxes. Things like health care (NHS), public education, parks and things like that depend on our taxes. She accesses these things like the rest of us, so shouldn’t she be contributing? 

But I also know that major corps get tax breaks and billionaires are dodging the tax office as much as they can too, so I’m kinda torn on this one. Is it really that big a deal if she’s not paying her 20k a year?  

WIBTA if I reported her so that she has to formalise her business and start paying tax?

ETA: I say side hustle, but she’s absolutely working a full time job from home. I don’t know how much she earns, but a middle income earner in the UK pays anywhere from £10k to £50k in tax depending on income. Just wanted to clarify that since I wasn’t clear.

Edit 2: The evasion gets up my nose because she basically has a full time business set up out of her house. She advertises, organises bookings with the general public, does an array of treatments from lash tint and wax to facials and body scrubs etc. it’s like a mini day spa. 

in saying that, the judgement seems pretty split down the middle, but someone left a comment that said I’d technically be correct to report her but still would be a major asshole. And given that this is the AITA sub I accept that judgement. I won’t report her, and I’ll leave any discussion about the tax stuff to my partner. I guess eventually given that she does have an audience, the HMRC will catch on eventually.",1
"Let me just start off and say I think cheating is deplorable.

I have two brothers, John (28) and Matt (25).

Around three years ago, our family exploded when it came out that Matt was having an affair with John's fiance. A fiance who was 6 months pregnant. Matt turned out to be the father.

John was understandably humiliated and angry. I was fully on his side.  I was disgusted with Matt and the fiance.

Here's my issue though. At John's insistence, Matt has pretty much been excommunicated from our family. He isn't allowed at any gatherings where John is. And John purposely makes sure he is at every one. 

Matt married John's ex-fiance and are raising the 2.5 year old together.

To this day, Matt's wife is referred to as a whore and the baby is called a bastard. Only by John but in our family's presence. He hates them with a passion even today.

My parents have really struggled with this but have agreed to follow John's rule of no contact with the wife or baby. Even contact with Matt is done in secret.

Matt has been kicked out of our family business because John can't be in the same room as him. All photos of Matt have been hidden in the family home. No gifts have been given to Matt's child at all.

Am I absolutely crazy to think that three years of this is enough? 

Matt is clearly remorseful and has apologized many times in tears. He clearly regrets hurting our brother.

I can understand that John is absolutely hurt and it must've been the most painful betrayal.

But I still love both my brothers. Matt did a shitty thing but how much more does he need to be punished?

My poor parents have been broken hearted for the past three years because of this. They have confided in me that they are willing to forgive Matt and move on and regret letting it get this far. We were such a tight knit family before.

But I'm really worried that suggesting forgiveness with John will cause a massive fight and he'll make us choose between them. I also worry about his mental health.

There also the innocent child in this. He deserves a relationship with his grandparents and his aunt.

I have recently been visiting Matt and his family. They are clearly struggling with the isolation. His wife broke down and apologized as I held my nephew for the first time. My heart tore in two.

AITA for wanting to bring them into our family again and forgiving them? There is family reunion coming up in a week and I want them to attend.",1
"My wife certainly thinks it was an AH move and I don't think she's wrong. Here's the story. 

My wife is a social person with no close friends. This is due in part to the pandemic and in part because we moved about a year before the pandemic and in that year she tried hard to make friends (meetup, bumble BFF, etc) and wasn't able to find anyone. She's lost touch with most friends from college. There are a couple girls she speaks to a few times a year. She has an online hobby group she meets with for an hour once a week. She calls her mom once a week. And that's basically it for socializing. For some people that would be enough but it's not for my wife. She is desperately lonely and I empathize. 

By contrast, I am very socially anxious and have a hard time meeting new people, but I've been friends with the same group of guys (all just as awkward as me) since high school. We game together a few times a week online, so despite my introversion I have more social outlets than she does. She's expressed jealousy over this, especially since high school friends were never really an option for her due to moving. 

My wife is fixated on the idea of finding a ""bestie"". This is a woman she can call up anytime and chat with, have inside jokes, go shopping with, and share hobby stuff. She points to examples from romcoms with the close female best friend as a trope she envies. Now that we've been vaccinated a while she's started back on bumble BFF and is having limited success. I've seen her approach, she tends to swipe left on a lot of women because they don't share hobbies (my wife's hobbies of reading and writing don't seem super niche but she hasn't been able to find many people that share her passion for these things), they have a different lifestyle (enjoy bars, clubbing, etc) or she just gets a vibe from them. She's met a couple people in person and says that she doesn't think she'll contact them again. She also doesn't message people back often since ""making small talk is exhausting""

I don't know what it's like to be in her shoes, but I hate seeing her cry often out of loneliness. She asked me for advice and I told her the other day that given all the limitations, maybe her dream of a bestie is unrealistic and she should focus on finding hobby groups and other things on her own that could fulfill her. She told me I didn't understand, that someone like me that has never had to work for friends wouldn't understand. Was I the AH here?",1
"My ex-husband Dan and I have a 10 year old daughter, Emily. We divorced 8 years ago after Dan came out as gay and he effectively left me for one of his friends from work, Jim. They didn't have an affair but there were definitely feelings there before we separated. They now live together. I remarried 4 years ago to my husband Nick. Dan and I share custody of Emily pretty much 50/50.

One source of tension has been Emily's relationship with Jim. Dan, Nick and I all come from very conservative Christian backgrounds, whereas Jim is from a very left wing Jewish-Italian family. Emily has always been something of a free spirit and she and Jim get on like a house on fire. She and Nick have a good relationship but Nick is more of a typical stepfather. She respects Nick but she's obsessed with Jim. She always wants to be doing what he's doing. She's developed a bad habit of walking around the house without shoes or socks because he does, she only eats her eggs hard boiled because that's how he eats them, she always talks about how funny he is. I had to put my foot down last year when she started calling Dan and Jim her 'dads' but didn't call Nick her dad

It all came to a head last month when she came home from a week at theirs and proudly showed us some of the Italian that Jim has been teaching her. It turns out that she asked him to teach her Yiddish and Italian. I asked her why and she said that not only was it fun to have 'secret conversations' with Jim, she was the 'only child' who could 'carry it on.' This really annoyed me because she isn't Jim's child and she doesn't have an ancestral language to 'carry on'. Our family only speaks English and always has. I also felt like this made her relationship with Nick even more unequal as he doesn't have another language to teach her and bond with her over.

I immediately phoned Dan and expressed that I felt Jim was stepping over the line and getting too involved. Dan got uncharacteristically angry at me. He said that if I had a problem with Emily being closer to Jim than Nick, then it was up to Nick to build up his relationship with Emily, not up to Jim to tear his down. I said that Nick couldn't do that as he didn't get to just be the fun parent like Jim does, because Nick has to be the only father figure in our household whereas Jim can just be Emily's friend. Dan told me that I was being ridiculous and accused me of being homophobic, which is ludicrous.

He must have said something about it to Emily as she's stopped talking about Jim in our house, which I'm glad about, but she's been very frosty with us. Nick has tried to get her involved in things they can do together but she's not showing any interest. I feel like I did have to say something but I'm worried I went over Nick's head and made things worse and should have left him to handle it. I just want Jim to stop overstepping.

**Edit**: thank you everyone for the insight. I made it clearer in the comments than in my OP but I left my very religious upbringing a little under 10 years ago (hence why I'm on Reddit in the first place!) and clearly have a long way to go when it comes to unlearning a lot of things that are more ingrained than I thought. Unfortunately I'm not a troll, just someone who has been viewing a situation with blinkers on. I have read through all the comments, even the ones calling me evil and irredeemable, and will be taking a lot of your advice moving forwards. It won't happen overnight but there's some sobering things to take on board. I'll give an update if the mods let me as a few people have asked for that.

**Edit 2**: we wear socks and slippers inside! Not shoes! (But it seems like this is apparently a much stranger rule than I thought, so I'm very open to swallowing my pride on that one.)",1
"My dad always liked my brother more. I mean, I kinda get it. He is the perfect son every parent would have wanted to have. I'm this medicore girl who struggled through a CS degree. 

My dad bought my brother a very expensive watch and paid for his trip to Europe when he graduated. He probably spend more than 25,000 dollars on his graduation. 

My dad didn't even want to go out with me. I told him that I wanted to go out and he said he was busy but wanted the give me my graduation gift and he said he will transfer 5,000 dollars to my account. I was excited to spend the evening with him but he blew me of. I wasn't happy when told me about my gift. 

He could see that I was upset and asked me if it wasn't enough in an irritated tone. I told him that it wasn't as he didn't even know what I liked to buy something I would like and I was getting way less than my brother got as always. I told him I didn't want his money and left. 

My dad sent a long text and told me that I would have gotten something better if I had studied harder. My brother got a scholarship while I barely got into my college and he had to pay all the fees. He hasn't talked to me since it has happened and I wasn't invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas. I just feel like an ungrateful Asshole right now.

"20M here. Went to a ground with a shed yesterday. My usual hanging out spot with friends for catching up, taking a smoke etc. Have been using that shed for the past 2-3 months. Yesterday a lady was sitting under the shed and as usual I went there to take a smoke alone. Since she was sitting there, I was considerate enough to ask that if she minds if I take a smoke. She replied do not smoke and I respect that. I sat there for 30-40 mins hoping that she would leave in the next minute. But she was still sitting there. She asked me the time, to which I replied 5.15 PM. After a few minutes I asked her when she will leave so that I can smoke in peace. She looked at me in awe and said you will have to wait for 2 hours more because my husband will come to pick me up. I lost my mind as that shed is literally the only place where I can smoke safely and peacefully without being caught by my parents or relatives living nearby. I asked her why she was waiting for her husband in a dilapidated shed like this to which she replied, it's none of my business. I couldn't argue more so I took my cigarette and lit it. As I started to smoke she started mumbling something in her mother tongue which I didn't understand. After smoking I left and she also left at the same time. I'm just wondering why did she have to stay there the whole time, wasting mine and her own time? IDK whether she was lying about her husband or not but she left as soon as I finished. 

Go on start judging.
EDIT: Been almost 10-12 hours ever since I posted this and majority of the people declared me to the AH. I agree with it and it was wrong on my side to do the actions which I did.

"My (m33) girlfriend Katia (f31) and I have been together for about a year. We don’t live together yet but I’ve tried to have that conversation as I really want us to live together.
Unfortunately, I recently quit my job and cannot afford to rent my current flat. Katia lives in a nice neighbourhood and owns her flat. It’s a two bedroom flat except she converted one bedroom into her office space.
Except that she doesn’t need it. Katia is a writer. She writes romance novels and self publishes them. She’s one of the lucky ones who actually make quite a lot of money doing that. The thing is, she doesn’t need an office. She can write from anywhere, her living room, her bedroom, she sometimes writes in a library, coffee shop, the castle ruins (of the weather is nice), the beach. You get the point.

As I’m not unemployed, I’ve thought about finally chasing my dream and starting streaming games. For that, I need a separate room to put my set up and record things.
When I first talked to Katia about moving in, she was apprehensive but the more we talked, the more open she was to the idea. Last night, I mentioned that she’d have to get rid off her office. She asked why and I told her that she can write wherever she wants and I need a space to start my streaming career. 
She replied that it was not going to happen, we can make some space in the living room but she needs her office.

I told her it’s just silly books, she can write them anywhere and I can’t bring my gaming set up to a cafe. 

She told me to not diminish her work and I said I wasn’t but it’s true, her job isn’t hat difficult and she can do it from the couch.

She got really weird after. Tris morning when I was about to leave her house, she told me I had to look for my own flat because she didn’t want to move in together.

I asked her if she was serious? And she said that yes, I was disrespectful and demanding she got rid off her office was asshole behaviour. I told her I only wanted us to work together and it’s asshole behaviour to leave me without a place to stay when she knows I can’t afford my flat.

She told me she had  to think about this and called me but I told her when she calls me I expect an apology.

I was venting to my mate over a lunch beer today and he agreed with me but his girlfriend said Katia was right and I was the asshole. My mate told her she didn’t know what s he was talking about.  
I still think Katia was the asshole but I wonder, perhaps I was one to? I need that place to live and if I was the asshole I might need to pretend to apologise. AITA?",1
"Brett is a ""casual"" friend of mine. 

We became friends through other mutual friends and will occasionally grab a beer during lunch, but won't really hang out together unless it's an-involved bigger group activity (like bowling). He's a nice guy, likes good music and *The Yankees* but isn't weird about it since he knows I don't know shit about baseball. 

Anyway last year, my SO and I were invited to his wedding and got a *Save the Date* in the mail. Due to the pandemic, the wedding was postponed and they had to reschedule for this year. 

They sent out revised *Save The Dates* and the wedding falls on a weekend that my SO and I are planning to move. We couldn't do it any other weekend, and since Brett is only a casual friend I figured he wouldn't be heartbroken if we couldn't make it to his big day...especially considering the circumstances. Moving is hella stressful. At some point they mailed us an RSVP, but the house is in such chaos right now I'm almost positive I threw it away by accident. 

I figured it was no big deal, I was meeting Brett for lunch anyway (this was last week) and I'd just let him know in-person that we weren't able to make it, but we'd still get him a gift off his wedding registry. I was aiming for the *Kitchen Aid* toaster.

Brett and I met for a beer and it was a good lunch, we chatted about work and video games, etc. and of course the topic of the wedding came up. He asked me if I got my RSVP and I told him we received it. I explained the situation, said it was unavoidable but we were going to be moving that weekend and wouldn't be able to make it. He seemed only mildly disappointed, but totally understood. But then that's where the problem came up. 

He asked me to just mail back in the RSVP with ""no"" in the box. I asked why, since I was telling him in-person. He was insistent that I send him back a physical copy. I asked if I could just text him a reminder so he could write it down. He said he gets a lot of texts per day. I asked maybe an email reminder? he refused, said he gets a lot of work emails.  

Me: “Why do I need to mail back the card? I just told you I’m not coming?”

Brett: “I’ll forget... The cards are the only way for me to keep track.”

Me: “Well, I may have already thrown it out.”

Brett: “What? Why?!”

Me: “I knew we were meeting! And, well, I'm pretty sure it didn’t have pre-paid postage!”

Brett: “Oh, so that’s it, huh? Can’t spare the extra 47¢?”

Me: “It’s 2021! Who even has stamps?! I’d need to find out where a post office is, then do I walk? Take an Uber? And once I’m there, do I buy a single stamp or a full sheet? Maybe one of those rolls? It’s just all too much.”

Brett: “Maybe it’s better that you don’t come.”

Me: “I wasn't coming anyway!”

I offered to write down my RSVP on a napkin for him but the lunch was pretty much over.

I'm still getting him a toaster.

AITA?

**EDIT**

Not that it really matters but Brett is still getting an $80 toaster out of this

"It was suggested i post my predicament here.  

I've (62F) rented out a large Vrbo in a Colorado ski town for an early September family vacation. I'm paying for the rental.  I have 3 daughters.  2 of the girls are married with each having one kid each under 4. I've spent weeks planning this and putting this together and its possibly going to fall apart.  

My last daughter (middle child) had asked if she could bring her 3 year old Chocolate Lab. I initially told her yes as long as she paid the pet fee portion and she was responsible for everything related to her dog.  Her dog is well behaved, but likes interacting with people and can be a lot of work. 

I informed my daughters with kids and one was like, as long as I don't have to take care of it I don't care.  The other one was vehemently opposed and said she'd consider not going.  She has a 8 month old right now who will be about 11 months when the trip occurs.  She said she did not want her daughter around dogs yet.  She also said she didn't want to spend time with the dog.  She pointed out that the Vrbo rules is that it can't be left alone in the house and my daughter doesn't want it going everywhere with us when we do a family dinner for example.  She doesn't understand how its feasible the dog comes, i think she has a point. 

Here is the thing, I want to watch my grandkids and spend time with them.  I don't really want to have to deal with my daughters dog at the same time.   I love my grandkids to death and don't see them as often as I'd like since all my kids live a few hours away from me.  I was going to take this opportunity to watch them and spend some quality time with them.  While my kids were out i'd take care of the grandkids.  Thats how I envisioned this trip going. 

 I told my daughter that Unfortunately she would not be able to bring her dog.  She did not take the news well and called me an asshole for catering to my other daughter, she is now thinking about not going.  I offered to pay for a sitter or to board it.  She called me an asshole for even suggesting that.  My husband is staying out of it, but i've managed to get him to admit that he'd rather it just be the grandkids and no dog.  I've discussed this with her several times and none of the conversations have ended well. She is angry that I changed my mind.  Am I the asshole here?  

&#x200B;

Edit: The time period from my okaying the dog to telling my daughter it couldn't come was the same day.  I made an incorrect assumption that the dog was okay by everyone.  My daughter with the 8 month old had traveled pre-child with the daughter had the dog and the dog was on the trip, so that was my basis of assuming everyone was okay with it.  That was my mistake for assuming a yes by all. ",1
"My (21m) six year old sister makes it hell when I ask her to wear a seatbelt. If someone especially a kid, ie my own little sis, doesn't wear a seatbelt in the car, I get very anxious. My parents have done everything to get her to put it on from explaining the importance to grounding her but she still makes it a headache to put on a seatbelt.
I am thinking about approaching a police buddy and asking him to pull me over and specifically have a ""strict"" talk with her. My mom supports this extreme measure but I am wondering if IWBTA as this could be a traumatizing event for her. In addition, I am not even sure if it could be construed as an abuse of power for my police buddy.

Edit 1.  A I cannot believe that this post blew up that much. After carefully reading all your guy's comments, I have decided not to do what was originally planned. Mind you, my buddy was not gonna tell at her, she is a six year old after all. I asked her if there was a reason she does not like seatbelts and she mentioned it hurts her stomach so I am going to be looking for alternative straps. In addition, like someone recommended I am going to ask my friend to give her a tour of a police car
 and to gently remind her that seatbelts at awesome.

 To the people leaving nasty PM's about me abusing my lil sister, Why? This sub exists for situations like this where you are not sure and ask others for judgement.",1
"TA acc

I live abroad in european country but I am originally from middle east. I meet my family in Dubai every holiday. 

Last time I went to Dubai my sister bought me one awesome parfume and I wear it all the time. It s a little bit heavy but really nice and pleasant. Well to the story. 

I went to work for the first time since I came back from Dubai and I used the parfume. I was most of the day alone in my office but when I came to the common room one of my coworkers told me ""wow, you are wearing some new parfume... its really strong."" and left the room. I didnt think anythink of it until later in the day when I came back, sat next to her and in few moments her eyes got all watery and she started to sniff. She left the room again and havent returned. Later she wrote me an email if I could stop wearing the parfume because it s causing her some allergic reaction or something like that and that it s just too strong. 

I texted her that I am sorry but I couldnt, it was a gift from my sister and I really love it. I told her I could try to wear a little bit less of it so it does not smell so heavy for her. Since then she refused to be in the same room with me and she is venting the common room everytime I leave it. But I think its better to have strong parfume than be a smelly person. 

so reddit aita for wearing parfume at work?",1
"My (57M) daughter Jane (21F) has recently been accepted into the university of her choice ,now me and my wife (55F) are glad with this news , the only thing is that Jane got accepted to do an English degree.

Now Jane, compared to her two brothers Mark (28M) and Leo (30M) was quite late in applying to university. When me and my wife asked her to start at 18 she claimed that she was not ready and wanted to have a ""little rest"", a little rest being going out with friends and travelling the whole of last year with her boyfriend.

It should be noted that I supplied Jane with all the money needed for her little rest .

Now me and my wife have nothing against Jane doing what she did, she's young and young people live to explore and do what they do, however before me and my wife allowed for Jane to do her thing we made her promise that when she did apply to university it was for a degree that was worth it - Jane was going through a weird phase where she wanted to be many things that were more on the creative side.

Fast forward a year later we find out that Jane's gone behind our backs and applied for an English degree.

Both Leo and Mark took medical degrees and are now very good, well payed doctors. One would think that this would motivate Janet to go on the same path but instead she has decided to be ""herself"".

I sat down Jane last night and told her that if she decided to go through with the English degree, I would not support her at all and that she would have to take out her own student loan, at this she began crying claiming that I was the ""worst dad ever"" and had always favoured her brothers over her (because I had paid for their university fees) - now this is totally incorrect I did literally pay for her travel all of last year.

My sons think that I'm being too harsh and that I should simply support Jane regardless of what she chooses, but is it too much to ask of my daughter to follow through with an actually useful degree?

EDIT: No, my daughter's year of travel does not add up to her brothers tuition fees, not even close. For those wondering I work as a cardiologist. 

Me not wanting my daughter to do an English degree is not because I'm sexist but because I want her to do something useful which she can live off instead of depending on me for the rest of her life. 

I don't even know if this is something she really wants to do or if it's another way of trying to rebel against me.",1
"I'm getting married in a week. One of my  bridesmaids, June, is pretty much the opposite of me. Shes very reserved whereas I am a party type gal--love going out to clubs with my fiance! Anyways, for my Bachelorette party, I wanted to go hire male strippers. Everyone thought it was a great idea...except June.

June said she was happy I was happy, but she wouldn't be attending that type of event. I asked her why, I made sure to plan it on a day everyone could come. She said it wasn't something she was comfortable with. I got upset and told her its not about her comfort, its about attending to support me.

She told me she would be very upset if her husband attended a party with strippers and so she woule never even ask to do the same. It would be ""hypocritical"" of her to hold him to those standards but expect to be able to do what she wanted just bc it was my Bachelorette. June told me she'd be happy to attend once they left but there was no way she'd disrespect her husband like that. She also said that even if he wasn't in the picture, shes not comfortable with it.

I got very upset and told her she was a bad friend for completely refusing to even ask her husband or to put aside her goody-two-shoes attitude for one night thats for ME, NOT her or her husband.

Aita for getting mad?

**Edit: Alright guys, I get it, Im a major asshole. I really didn't expect it to blow up this much. June ended up seeing it, I didn't know she had reddit. It hasn't gone well. Her husband called me and said some really rude things because June has been crying ever since she saw it. I guess I'm going to have to go deal with this now. Please stop sending me harrassing messages and calling me names.**",1
"Okay, so I’m using a throwaway.

I (24F) am staying with my sister, have been for the past 9 months to help out with my sister (26F) during her pregnancy, she gave birth via C-section 3 weeks back. 
Yesterday a few relatives came to meet my sister (who we’ll call Beth) and the baby.

So Beth was not really upto sitting with our relatives the entire time (she complained of feeling sick and feeling pains in her stomach) so she often went back to her bedroom, leaving me to talk with the relatives.

Somehow my marriage came up in conversation and one of my uncles asked me about my husband. I have been married for 3 years. I told them he was fine and just a bit busy adjusting back to in person work.

Then my aunt asked me when I was planning on having a baby, and that having a baby when I would be 30+ was a bad decision, etc.

The thing is that I don’t really want babies. For one I really don’t want to go through the pain of it all. I had been there with Beth during her entire pregnancy and I also went to visit her after her C-section. I’m also very scared about a lot of things about pregnancy. I have body dysmorphia and after Beth’s C-section, she would constantly pick apart flaws in her body. She used to never do that and always used to be very proud of her body. So I imagined if she was so insecure about her body after pregnancy, I would be much, much worse.

I didn’t want to tell them the whole of it so I just told them that pregnancy would possibly ruin my body and that I wasn’t really upto all the symptoms during pregnancy. 

They just nodded and carried on talking.

An hour after they left, I tried to talk to my sister but she wasn’t opening the door. I didn’t understand why but she would just keep saying that she needed to rest for a bit and asked me to take the baby to her so that the baby could feed. 

After that she locked the door and told me not to disturb her. I thought it was probably post pregnancy pains or something like that but my mother called me and asked me if I had said that post pregnancy bodies were ugly. I told her I didn’t.

She told me to stop lying and that when my aunt called her she told her that I said that post-pregnancy bodies were ruined, etc. She told me that my sister was really hurt by that comment, considering that I had told my sister multiple times her body was very pretty after birth. 

I was really confused because I didn’t mean that bodies were ruined after pregnancy, I meant my perception of my body would be ruined. I tried to explain that to my mother but she told me that she could do anything about it but it was really hurtful of me to say that.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for saying that I didn’t want to get pregnant because it ruined how I saw my body? I think I might be the asshole because my sister is really sensitive right now and I might have shamed her body by that comment even though that wasn’t my intention.

UPDATE:
 I understood that my comment was pretty badly received by everyone. I asked my sister if I could talk to her and I tried to talk about last night’s events. She told me she was majorly hurt by the comment.
At the end, though, we reconciled because I understood she didn’t hear WHAT I meant, she heard from my aunt that I said that and thought I was talking about it in reference to her body. I’ve apologised still because it was a pretty insensitive thing of me to say.

I hope you all have a great day!",1
"Visited  a popular restaurant in my city the other day. They have stopped accepting table bookings online so went there early and managed to get a table with my friend. It is a popular restaurant and usually has a waiting line outside. I did have a lovely lunch there and loved catching up with a friend I hadn’t seen in a year, but while we were having dessert, the waiters kept hinting that we need to wrap up our time there faster, since they started having a queue outside (at this point we were in the restaurant for about 90 mins). Being asked to pretty much leave left a sour taste to an otherwise lovely lunch. So I brought this up in a review online but was wondering if I’m overreacting and being entitled/an asshole since I got very mixed opinions about this with the people around me. I do get that a lot of people want to try out the restaurant too, but I was a paying customer as well?

Update - The review was more positive than negative (gave them 4/5 stars as well), however considering a lot of things said below, I have deleted the review",1
"I made an ALT account to ask this, since a bunch of my family follow my primary one.
I’m also.. not completely sure of the rules here, so I’ll try to keep it as PG as I can.

So, me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 3 years. We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)
I will say that she’s the first thin person I’ve ever been with. She’s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I’ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I’ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.
This all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She’s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she’s not attractive if she doesn’t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.
I told her I had to be honest, and said that I’m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b-bs. It’s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I’m being honest, that’s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.
She was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we’ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn’t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).

Am I being the asshole here?

Here’s an update, for people who wanted it. Ignore if you don’t care, I won’t be mad: https://www.reddit.com/user/waywiser86/comments/azskqk/aita_only_update/",1
"I F(15) am going to my parents F(36) M(35) wedding in a couple of months. My father brought up to me that I can't wear my full-face goth makeup. I understand that it's her wedding day and she wants things a specific way, but I don't understand why I can't wear my makeup. My dad says it how she wants it to be for the pictures and such, and that it's a 'respect' thing. 
I should mention that they are very accepting of how I dress/present. Which is why I was confused when he said that she didn't want me to wear my makeup.
I'm not trying to get attention - that's not my intention. I feel comfortable with how I dress and feel 'at home' with my makeup. So I sort of feel like they're restricting that for some pictures at the wedding.

But I could be wrong, AITA?

EDIT: I realize that I am the asshole. I was a bit self centered with what I wanted, but I talked with my step-mom and she said no white foundation and we could find a look that we both like that I could do. It's not my day. And there's a time and place for things. Thank you for your guys input :)",1
"My (56F) step-daughter Beth (31F) is getting married to her fiance David (27M) next weekend. It would have been sooner had it not been for everything getting shut down. Beth's sister Christine (27F) scheduled her thesis defense to be on the same afternoon as the wedding rehearsal. She's doing her second Master's thesis for her second Master's Degree. Christine's husband Zack (27M) will be there watching her so he won't be at the rehearsal either. They have 3 year twins a son and daughter but they won't be at the defense so I'm not sure they where they will be, at the rehearsal or back at the house or not.

I know Christine is anxious to get the second degree done after the start was deferred and delayed for a year because she had the twins but I can't believe she would have her defense on the afternoon of the wedding rehearsal. My husband (57M) doesn't think it's a problem for her to miss it but I don't think he understands in general how much weddings mean to the bride and I know Beth wants her family at the rehearsal supporting her. Between house hunting and wedding planning during a pandemic it's been a busy time so I understand why Beth wants the support. I don't usually agree with Beth's mother but in this situation she's upset at Christine too. I'm not sure her husband's opinion but I know she agrees with me. I don't see why Christine can't reschedule the defense and not come to the rehearsal in support of Beth like she asked.",1
"My brother, his fiance, and her daughter (10) planned to visit for the week. Before they left, I asked if they needed me to pick anything up for them and he sent me a grocery list and said his stepdaughter is picky so they'll cook for her separately while they're here. 

The list had a ton of crap that I won't get my kids like shaped kraft mac and cheese, uncrustables, fruity pebbles, juice boxes, fruit cups, and cinnamon rolls (they're a very special treat in my household). By the time I actually read the list, they were already on the plane so I didn't text him to let him know I won't be buying this stuff because there isn't much he could do anyways. 

I told him I didn't get what he asked for when they got to my house from the airport because my kids will want it and I'm not going to deal with the arguments and tantrums. He said this is some of the only things his stepdaughter will eat, especially the cereal and cinnamon rolls. They're the only thing she eats for breakfast. 

I still told him I won't have those foods in my house, we argued, he called me a food nazi, and then they left and booked an air bnb. He's still at the air bnb a couple miles from my house but my kids and i havent seen him this week. AITA for not getting the sugar cereal and cinnamon rolls",1
"I came to Reddit for an honest opinion on if I’m the asshole. I (32M) have been divorced from my ex wife Elle (32F) for 4 years. It was not a nice thing. She and my ex best friend Silas (25M) have been married for 3 and have 1 year old baby.

My parents and Elle’s parents were long time family friends and that didn’t stop after our divorce. My parents are hosting their yearly “garden party” which is just an excuse for them to catch up and gossip with the other seniors. I was visiting my parents when they told me that Silas and Elle would be in town and they were invited to the garden party. My parents can’t wait to meet their baby.

I told them no they are not coming. My parents didn’t budge and said they would not be rude enough to retract an invitation after Elle and Silas agreed. I said no one wants their ex wife at their parents’ party. My parents said I could be polite for one day. They really want to meet the baby and catch up with them. 

I made an ultimatum that it was either me or them. I would not attend if they came. My parents called me an asshole for making them choose as Silas and Elle hadn’t asked it and potentially making Elle’s parents think badly of them. AITA?",1
"So things are bias in my favor, as you likely already know because other person (grandma) cant defend herself here.

Me and my grandma, G for short have been fighting over the thermostat. Its winter where i am and temperatures can be very cold. She likes it warm and i prefer it more cold. The house is hers and i pay the electric (i have not and will not use this against her in any conversations i have with her). She prefers having the house at 78 degrees which is quite warm for me, so much so that i had to sleep in my car 4 days ago as i was sweating without moving trying to sleep. Yesterday i had lowered the temperature to 72 so i could sleep. I let her know while she was at work (night shift). I had 2 cold waters and snuggled up to sleep. 
When she got home this was our conversation

G: Remove blanket when ur sleeping and I have a thought close ur vents and open ur window then you will get the cold air you need.

Me: I lowered the temperature to be more comfortable, and had 2 waters

G: You can make ur bedroom into an icebox so you can sleep open window, close vents, & close ur bedroom door. But don’t forget (brother), his immune system is weaker than urs. It got 32 degrees this morning is that cold enough?

I can’t take a shower cause if I do my metabolism will drop and I will freeze all day until I can get it back up, and n the meantime the house chores don’t get done, if I’m stuck n my bedroom.

Me: Because i lowered the temperature to 72?

G: Yes 72 is too low, for me, when you get to b my age you won’t want to have the temperature at 72. Most people have it at 75. 

Me: So to recap just to be certain you know what your saying. 6 degress is the difference between being comfortable, and it being too cold to take a shower, it drops your metabolism, and sticks you to your room all day? And be 6 degrees, in your words, 3 less than “most people?”

G: The 75 is for people that have good circulation so they don’t get too cold, I on the other hand have to have it higher cause my circulation is poor, and I was trying to b reasonable with the temperature between 77 and 78.

I plan on moving out because of this which i know will start a fight with more family. I rarely eat food she buys or get in her way, my leaving will be a financial burden on her and emotional burden on mom (maybe brother). Id rather be in a place where i can get a nights rest after work instead of sleeping due to exhaustion. I dont want to pick a fight and am going to leave things here and quietly leave later this week. Am i the butthole?",1
"My wife and I are expecting our first in May.  We've been together 10+ with 7 of them married so naturally we've discussed all things baby, family, etc.  One of the things that has come up before is the day of our little ones arrival.  I've stated in no uncertain terms that I believe the only ones in the delivery room outside of medical professionals should be her and I.  My wife however, has expressed that she'd like her mother to be in the room.  We haven't discussed this in some time and definitely not since finding out we're expecting, but I do anticipate the topic coming around again soon.

I take issue with my MIL being there bc while she has been very supportive throughout the process (unsuccessful attempts for years followed by several rounds of IVF) I'm of the opinion that this is one of those bonding moments for us and us alone since we are the ones directly involved in this event.  I'm not saying she shouldn't be at the hospital, or even come in to see her before the procedure begins - I'm fine with all of that.  But when it comes time for the main event so to speak, I feel it's time for her to head to the waiting room.  I want this time alone with my wife to laugh, to cry, to enjoy our child privately before they become a spectacle for everyone else.

I've learned quickly that pregnancy hormones are a very real thing, so I'm not entirely certain what to expect when this conversation happens again.  So I'm wondering AITA if I stick to my guns on this one, or am I better off taking one for the team, sucking it up and letting my MIL (in my opinion) ruin the moment.

"Typing this at the airport before my flight starts boarding.

Im in college.  I’ve been dating Steve for a year.  Steve is from a rural town in Ohio where nothing ever happens.  He’s been begging me to come out to see him over the summer.  I considered it, until I found out my two best friends will be visiting their boyfriends in Europe (exchange students).  

I was not about to waste two weeks in fucking Ohio while they’re hiking in the Alps with their boyfriends.

So I decided, fuck this shit.  And now im waiting to board a flight to Denver for six weeks of hiking and camping across four states.  

Steve has been blowing up my phone and begging me to reconsider.  He wants to introduce me to his family and check out life in Ohio for when we graduate next year.  I told him no and hung up when he called me jealous for blowing off Ohio because my friends would be having a cooler summer break than me.

I ask if im the asshole because my friends were with me when he last called.  While we are sick of Steve’s shit, they think I may have been harsh when I blew up at him for pestering me about his stupid summer plans.  Its not just a vacation, he wants a life with me in ducking Ohio.

"I (28f) met one of my best friends Iris (43f) in 2020 when we were both studying. I know the age gap is big but we have a lot in common and always have a lot to talk about. Iris is a single mother to her son (9) which I have grown to be close with as well as I visit them every week, sometimes multiple times a week.

Iris truly is a great mother, and her son is amazing. I don’t always agree with the way she handles things but I never ever say anything because it’s not my kid and as long as there’s no real harm and her son is safe I’m staying out of it.

But there is one thing that is bugging me. For context, Iris has found herself in a very unfortunate situation in that she struggles to find a job. She has gone to multiple interviews but with no luck. The mental toll this has taken on her has lead her to be a bit passive with her son in the every day life. She’s present in the big moments, and at school, but I think she just doesn’t have a lot of energy to argue so he gets his way a lot. He’s a gamer and if he can help it he would stay inside as much as he can playing video games. Which he does a lot.

Her son also struggles with food. There’s a lot of things he doesn’t like, mostly healthy stuff. So he eats a lot of pizza and I’m pretty sure he eats candy every single day. Obviously I’m not there to watch every single meal he eats and I’m sure there’s some healthy things in between, but from what I’ve seen to what she’s told me I know that he doesn’t have a healthy diet. This is starting to get noticeable on his body.

I am a big mental health advocate and I would never want to inflict bad body image on someone else, especially not a child. But I am concerned that he will grow up to be obese. I am really conflicted here but I do feel like I should say something.

"My (27) gf(24) has been working on a visual novel game as a side project for almost 2 years and recently finished it. She wanted me to play it but I initially declined since I'm not into visual novels or reading long stories but after she begged, I gave it a try and played for a good 15 mins. Now I can tell she put in a lot of effort in the writing and the art and it was a good start but I just got tired of reading and stopped. She asked what I thought and wanted me to eventually finish it and tell her what I thought about the choices and the endings but I told her I had no plans to. She looked shocked and asked if it was boring, I told her no, it's just that I'm just not into this type of genre and she knows im not into reading but asked me to make an exception this time since she made it. I got upset because I think she is being childish and wants to blackmail me into doing something I don't want. After I made it clear I wasn't continuing, she hasn't talked to me. I already know that she is talented and smart so just because I don't want to play it doesn't mean I dont support her. Some of my friends agree she's being immature but others think I should be more supportive. So AITA?",1
"My family and I are in a heated argument about this, and I don't know if I'm in the wrong. Hopefully, you guys can tell me if I'm an asshole or not. 

My sister and I are joint tenants and rent a two-bedroom, long-term rental apartment. My sister never went to college, but I did. I went straight to college and continued to pay half the rent; although I felt it wasn't fair as I was never home, I didn't speak up. Since going to college, I have gained a lot of skills and qualities; I feel like a new me, a better me. I recently started my postgrad, moved three to four hours away for college, and haven't yet come home. I'm making ends meet, and I do have a bit of cash aside each month after bills, rent and food are all paid for. Since starting college, I haven't paid half the rent because I'm not paying for a place I'm not living at. My sister has a low-wage job; she's pissed with me and is struggling to make ends meet because she's paying the full rent, bills and other things.

My parents and sister's views are that because I'm on the lease, I should pay half the monthly rent and bills. If I'm not living there, I shouldn't have to pay rent on a place I'm not living in even though my name is on the lease. If I'm living there, I will pay rent and half the bills. 

Before leaving to start my postgrad, I did contact my landlord, and we had a face-to-face meeting regarding options. It's going to be challenging to remove my name of the lease, I decided reluctantly to keep my name as a joint tenant as I'm going to be doing a PhD afterwards, I won't be able to afford a place of my own due to the amount of debt and I would look at renting a room but I don't want to keep moving around all the time. 

Does this make me the asshole?",1
"My sister lost her business due to COVID-19 at the end of 2022. Since then she hasn’t worked and doesn’t qualify for assistance.

In July she tried to psychoanalyze a situation I was in 30+ years ago & I lost my temper. She cut me out of her life after that, calling me toxic and untrustworthy. 

In August I reached out to let her know I’m here for her but she’s not over her rage at me. 8 days later she asked me for money, saying it sucks she has to ask me for help and kiss my ass. I loaned her $12K and gave her another $3K in e-transfers. Again she goes no contact.

Feb. 2024 she again asks for help. She owes on her house, cars,etc. Can I help her until she can sell her house? Told her I’m in debt myself and lost my job the previous year. I have my own home & 2 sons going to university to pay for. She said I can afford to dig deeper. She has nothing to dig into of her own. I agree to another $15K but tell her this is causing stress/arguments in my house.

I’ve offered to help her get her house ready for sale/find her a job so she can move forward in a positive position. She refuses any help. She said since she has willed everything to me I am being cheap by not going further into debt since I’ll inherit everything.

The expectation that I support her household with more than $30K in five months (single/childless) is beyond what I can afford. Am I the asshole for cutting her off and blocking her?",1
"In a world of opposites attract:

\- I (36/M) am very logical. I have a hard time saying absolutes in conversation, and sometimes misread social cues. I will often say ""probably"" even if I am 99% certain of something being true. Lets call me Joe.  
\- My wife (37/F) is by comparison, emotional and empathetic. Lets call her Kim.

Today, while I was out with my daughter, Kim made rice for dinner. When I got home, she opened the fancy automatic rice cooker to find the rice was a bit firmer than usual. While the rice cooker is indeed fancy, I know if you get the rice to water ratio wrong, it can throw things off. I took a look and agreed it was a bit firm but otherwise fine (no problem!), but suggested that perhaps too much rice was added vs the water (I have messed this up in the past miscounting how many scoops to add). Kim was adamant that she clearly remembered putting in the right amount of water and rice.

Now, I will accept that it could be any number of things that went wrong, but my mind could not accept that Kim 100% got the ratio correct. Afterall, everyone's memory is notoriously unreliable. It could be the rice cooker, it could be the rice, or it could have been the wrong water/rice ratio.

The following is heavily paraphrased:

Kim: I remember very clearly putting in the right amount of rice and water

Joe: Yes but its possible you mis-remembered

Kim: \*annoyed\* I did not screw up the rice or water

Joe: I'm not questioning what you feel about your memory. I'm just saying it's possible.

It went down hill from here.From Kim's perspective:- She felt I was insulting her ability to cook- I was gas lighting her into thinking she was not remembering correctly- I was being a bad partner for not believing her version of events since I was not there to see what happened

From my perspective:- I think she is a great cook, but also a human that can make mistakes, and I really don't care about the rice.- I had zeroed in on an absolute that I felt shouldn't exist, and was merely trying to point out that  despite her confidence, her making an honest mistake was possible, even if super unlikely.- I didn't feel like I was a bad partner since I believe almost nothing is 100%, so it should be normal to have a tiny bit of doubt regarding a version of events. What should matter is our reaction to uncertainty. Despite what I'd consider a healthy amount of doubt, I very much believe her version of events could be true.

Kim maintains that I am in the wrong because social convention dictates I shouldn't point out uncertainty when someone else has high confidence. I should simply trust they got it right and not be insulting.

I maintain that there should no reason to get upset, especially if logically, there is uncertainty everywhere. It should be normal to not be 100% sure. Then again, maybe I'm a social idiot and am saying the quiet things out loud. Should I just shut up and go along when someone speaks in absolutes like this? AITA?",1
"I've been a competitive runner for a while now, usually running several marathons, half-marathons, etc in a given year. I know many other local runners as well.

A while ago, I ran a half-marathon which is locally a bit infamous in the running community, because a long stretch of it runs along the coast, where a **massive** sea lion colony is. It's a mostly uphill stretch too, so you're breathing heavily and inhaling it....and it's held in the summer (here).

The stench is so bad that it quite significantly impacts most runners, sometimes severely...bad enough I questioned if I wanted to even run the race this year, but I thought I'd give it a try.

Well I ran it, and it was worse than I even remembered. One woman even threw up, but I staggered my way through it, and ended up finishing in 2nd place out of a field of a few dozen. Not bad.

But the winner was someone I knew - we've talked a few times in the past, usually friendly but she's a rival - and I usually finish well in front of her at other races. I know she has anosmia - little or no sense of smell. So she had a big advantage here that none of the rest of us had. 

When she started gloating a bit afterwards and saying how much she improved and how she finally beat me, I said that it should really come with an asterisk.

I mean, the organizers have rejected pleas to move it, saying it's a ""unique feature"" and part of the history of that race now, and even forbid runners to use noseplugs/vaporub/attempts to ""cheat"" their way around the ""obstacle"". Isn't anosmia the ultimate unfair advantage?

But she got surprisingly upset and said I was just jealous and I had no right to insult her for a disability she can't control. I was surprised others took her side too. AITA?

tl;dr Ran a half-marathon past some smelly sea lions, got beaten by a woman with anosmia, I told her it somewhat delegitimizes her victory.",1
"I (35M) have a daughter, Rebecca (15F) and I have to admit both my wife and I worked a ton. So we have money and since we were both busy with work we hired a maid and cook to come by twice a week. Well a while ago both of us realized Rebecca doesn’t now how to do much. So we changed what Sara (maid) cleans, no more cleaning Rebecca’s room or laundry.

Rebecca was not happy about this but she needed to learn how to clean up after herself before she went to college. Both of us then realized that Rebecca can not cook at all either. She only knows how to make sandwiches and heat food up. We really dropped the ball on this so we decided to have her cook dinner once a week.

It start two weeks ago and so far all Rebecca made was spaghetti and tacos. The are not difficult meals so yesterday I gave Rebecca a recipe to follow, chicken Parmesan. She was in the kitchen for three hours making it. I have to admit it wasn’t the best and I commented that.

Rebecca got really quiet and said well maybe if you actually taught me crap instead of throwing me to the wolves each time I could do stuff. She picked up her plate and throw the food away. I then grounded her and she went to her room.

I called my sister and she laughed and said I don’t even know how to cook either and that I am ass for always throwing my kids head first.",1
"This week is the carnival winter week at my son’s school and everyday it’s a different theme for the kids to dress up. He’s in kindergarten. Tomorrow is the  “Pink Shirt Day” and even though he’s been dressing up so far and will be dressing up on the other days, he says he does not want to participate tomorrow (he doesn’t want to wear pink). I was shocked because he really likes all colours and pink is one of his favorites (at least here at home), also he wore a pink shirt last Monday and didn’t even realized (ok it was more of a light pink/salmon color, but still). When I asked him why he didn’t want to wear pink (after using all the above arguments) he was adamant that he just didn’t want to wear pink, no other reason. 

I was okay with him not wanting to do that until he finally told me that he doesn’t want to go because his friends are not going to wear pink. So I said that if he’s choosing that because of others, that I wouldn’t allow him to just “loose” his authenticity. So I told him that he will wear pink whether he wants to or not.

My husband told me that I’m an ah for doing this, but I just can’t accept the fact that my kid, my brilliant amazing inteligente loving kid, will not wear pink because his friends are probably raised in a home where “pink is for girls and blue for boys”, which is not the case in our home. 

So guys… WIBTAH? 

Btw, the “Wear a Pink Shirt” is a way to stand up against bullying! Which I completely support!!! 

ETA: wow! This is my first time posting here and you guys are brutal! But also very reasonable. I would definitely be a big AH if I did that to my son. I wasn’t looking beyond my nose and that’s why I couldn’t see the obvious points that most you all brought up. I guess I was frustrated because I know as a fact that he loves pink, but you were right, I made this all about myself and my actions would be very contradictory to my ideas and beliefs (and hypocrite). So, he did not wear pink and I reassured him that he is his own person and has to do what he is comfortable with. A special thank you for those that gave really good advices and insights. He is my first son so I’m learning as we go. ",1
"I'm thinking about telling him but thought reddit could help me out. 

Context (sorry if it's long): 
So in my friend group there are 5 main people. Me, my boyfriend and I'll call the others W, K and S. W is the issue. None of us like him for many reasons (I'm okay disclosing a few if needed)  many people and I mean many people in our year/school don't like him for many reasons. 

So, me (16f) and my boyfriend (16m) have been together 4 months now and it's great. He's perfect. S and W used to date but S broke up with him over a month ago and he was heartbroken. Since then he's been basically attached to me and my boyfriend because he thinks he's best friends with my boyfriend. It's got so bad that not just us but also friends out of our main group makes jokes that it looks like he's gay for him and that W is ""trying to steal my man"" 

For the past month and a half, I feel like I've got no personal space with my boyfriend and my boyfriend feels like W is always in his space. W has interrupted me many times, spoiled a movie for me and my bf, touches my bf all the time when talking to him, always shoves his way in to be beside my boyfriend to the point where I've been blocked off from my bf and end up walking on the road even though I was on the pavement 2 seconds ago before that. None of our other friends do this, even ones my bf has known longer. Last week me and my friends were in a store getting lunch, me and my boyfriend were choosing what we wanted, W, S and K had already chosen. K and S were at the checkout and W waited on my bf like a child does to their parent it felt like. 

Obviously it's been bothering us for a while so last week my boyfriend brought it up to him and this is how it went 

Bf - hey, I don't mean to be rude or anything but do you think we could set some boundaries?

W- yeah sure I understand and I'll back up

Bf - oh thanks 

W- np

So we thought it would be resolved and I thought it was as W has backed up from him at break time. Last Friday my bf went home at lunch, Monday and Tuesday W was absent school and Wednesday my boyfriend was absent so today was when we'd really know if W would respect the boundaries. He did not.

All of lunch today, W wouldn't leave us alone for even a second again. When walking to lunch, W interrupted me twice and in the same store as last week interrupted me again when I was asking my bf about Christmas presents for his parents. W comes over and starts loud speaking over me and my bf even said ""why are two people talking to me at once?"" I quickly said ""well I was talking first and mine is probably more important"" (idk why I said that last bit, I understand it could be petty) W said ""fine, you speak"" and was quiet and waited on my bf again the same way as last week. I don't know whether to bring it up again.",1
"I (36M) work full time and my wife (32F) is a SAHM looking after our 2 year old twins. 

When we got married, we both agreed that my wife would be a SAHM, especially since we don't have any family/grandparents nearby. We were both in agreement and my wife made it clear she wanted to enjoy seeing our kids grow up (we don't plan on having any more).

I make a good wage so we are comfortable. I don't give my wife any spending limits (obviously we discuss big purchases) so she is free to buy herself things, I make sure she has access to money and she takes care of everything around the house.

I work from home and a typical day for me is 7am - 5pm. Once I finish work, I go and spend time with the twins while my wife makes dinner. We put them to bed together and my wife usually clears up in the kitchen. She is great at her job and the house is spotless. I am happy with this arrangement and I thought my wife was too.

Recently, she has been coming to me and saying that she feels burned out, unappreciated and taken for granted. I asked if I could do anything to help and she said that it would be nice if I did something now and again to show that I appreciated her. E.g. buying her favourite bar of chocolate when I go to the shop or something small, just as a gesture of appreciation. I'll admit that I didn't do this, purely because I am not in the habit to be honest.

We recently had a massive argument because my wife got completely fed up with being ""treated like a servant"". She basically said that her working hours are 5am - 9pm, 7 days a week and that she feels like I take her for granted. I told her that I understand it's a tough job but we both get on with our respective roles. I never ask her to thank me for making money, I think that's cringeworthy. I get on with my job because I have to provide for my family whereas she wants presents and treats for doing her job.

I essentially said this to her and now I'm wondering if I am the asshole - looking after kids and the house is tiring and she does work hard and takes care of everything. But at the same time, do I need to thank her on bended knee and buy her things just for doing her job? AITA?

EDIT: Ok, you can all stop tearing me a new asshole. I get it. I do get to relax at the weekend whereas my wife usually does her normal routine and gets on top of the cleaning etc. Just for the record, I do thank her for everything she does - I say thank you all the time but I understand that this may not be her love language.",1
"I (M21) can no longer deal with my (F18) sister's  obsession with a guy named Shayne Topp.
 She always says nonsense phrases like ""I am the chosen"" In a snarky ass voice, or yelling as loudly as possible, ""IM CARLY SHAY!"" It's like she's possessed by a demon. 

She has some similar attachments to other things because she's on the spectrum, but I didn't expect this obsession to go on for this long as it has. It's been going on for a year or two. Her phone wallpaper is literally a picture of the guy without a shirt and wearing glasses. 

And my breaking point was when she set her alarm to the sound of him screaming loudly. I didn't mind it too much because my own alarm is Dixon Dallas - Good Lookin. 
But what made it bad was that when I asked her about it, she said,  “Its a mating call."" This made me feel weird as hell.

 so I decided to take action. Since Mosh is where she goes to watch Shayne Topp, I asked our parents to stop her from watching it. It's pretty easy to get our parents into stuff as they think the Internet is evil. It has been four hours since I told them, and she has tried to call me 13 times while I'm at work.

My older sister called me an asshole for this and told me to get on here if I needed a ""wake up call"". Although I feel slightly guilty, I believe it was necessary for her to move past this weird phase. I used to drool over women like Phoenix and Storm from the X-Men But at least I'd masturbate in silence. I feel what she was doing is just plain weird.

AITA?

Okay I get it I'm an asshole for doing that. my older sister put me on here to be ridiculed by people on the Internet and I feel dumb because of it.",1
"Throwaway account

I (46M) have two sons (20 ""Andy"" and 18 ""Sam"") from my previous marriage. I got divorced from their mother about seven years ago and have been in my step-daughter, ""Emma’s"", life for six years. I love her to death, and I see her as my own kid.
 
Sam graduated back in June and was having a graduation party about a month later. But, his party happened to be the same day as Emma’s birthday party. She was really excited about her birthday and told me she wanted me to stay for her party. I said I’d try and call my son about it.
 
The day before their parties, I told Sam I would try and stop by, but he kept insisting I come for the full thing. I told him I’d try, but Emma’s birthday party is on the same day, and my wife and I have been planning it for over a month now. He just said ""okay"" and hung up the phone. Fast forward to the day of both parties. My wife said I should go to Sam’s party. I was planning on doing so, but Emma told me she really wanted me to stay.
 
I didn’t want her to be sad at her party, so I agreed and told them I would just leave later. Emma’s party was from 4-6 and Sam’s was from 4:30-7:30, so I was thinking I had plenty of time. I live over an hour away from my son, so I was planning to leave early. Anyway, I was helping my wife with a lot of stuff, taking care of the kids, and other things. By then, it’s already 6 pm and I feel bad.
 
I have so many things to help my wife with for cleaning up, and since I live over an hour away, I know I can’t make it. I did go to his graduation, so I assumed just going the day after to see him would be fine. Boy was I wrong. I call him after that and he practically goes insane, telling me he’s extremely angry, saying I love Emma more than ""my biological kid"", and that I always forget about him. He then tells me he doesn’t want me to come the next day and doesn’t want me to talk to him.
 
I haven’t missed a lot of his events, so I feel like he’s overreacting. I didn’t go to his 18th birthday party because of a big meeting I had, and I get why he was mad about that, but this seems like an overreaction. I apologized to him, but he didn’t accept it.
 
My ex-wife and wife said I should have gone and that I was being an idiot. My oldest son says I always choose Emma over him (which is not true) and that I was being a horrible father. I do feel bad, but I lost track of time. He won’t talk to me and neither will my oldest son.

"I [40m] and my wife [32f] have been married for three years. We currently live in a nice urban area in a condo that I purchased before marriage. What I love most about my current area is that I seldom have to drive. I work in a managerial role in a larger company and generally like my job, especially with the financial stability it proves.

My wife worked after high school for some years before returning to college, and she has been job hunting since last year. Last month, she had an interview set up a couple of hours away from our home (according to Google Maps it's about a 1 hour and 43 minute drive, but that could be worse depending on traffic conditions). When she asked if she should go to it, I said it couldn't hurt if she was interested, but we'd have to talk about the distance and what to do.

Long story short, she got offered the job, and she wants it badly. The salary is well above the average for her degree. It's close to what I'm making and I've been in this business for years.

She wants to move now. She says that with her other responsibilities, she can't afford to drive nearly four hours a day. At first I told her I'd think about it, but two nights ago I broke the news to her and said no. She asked why my job was more important, and I responded that it's because it's stable and all but guaranteed that I can continue working there, while there were no guarantees with hers. She asked me to meet her halfway and move to about a 30~ minute drive from there so I could be at work and home in about 2.5 hours of driving a day, which I refused.

Then she said I could get a job at a whole number of companies near her workplace for a competitive salary, but the thing is I just don't want to change jobs. I asked why she wouldn't look for something closer to us, at which point she started stonewalling me.

Was this kind of an assholish thing to do? I feel like I might have gotten her hopes up in relation to the potential of working at that job. On the other hand, I feel like asking me to sell our condo and uproot our lives for her first job offer is kind of silly.",1

"I (33M) kind of started a fight at my wife (30F) over her wasting food. She and I had very different upbringings when it came to food. Her family had the disposable income to eat out multiple times per month, and her family would cook large meals (enough to feed an army basically), and when the food entered “leftover territory,” the rule in their house was whoever gets to it first gets to it. My family was much more money-minded, only eating out on special occasions and cooking just enough for one or two meals. Takeout was never shared, and if we had leftovers, it was equally distributed. Some would be surprised to learn this has caused a great deal of dispute in our marriage.
My wife does the majority of the cooking, and she likes to order take in a lot, as we both have demanding jobs. Over our 10 year relationship, she has learned to cook in much smaller helpings as much of it would spoil. She’s not good about eating leftovers (the small of a lot of cold food makes her feel sick), so she tries to meal prep or cook just enough to cover 2 meals max as she knows letting food spoil irks me.
When we have leftovers, I always let her know when her portion is still in the fridge. Typically she tells me to have it if I want it. She has said before that if she were truly coming back for it, she’d write her name on it or tell me not to eat it as she was saving it for later, but to my recollection she has never done that. I always tell her that the leftovers are her’s so she can have them, and we go back and forth like that in several rounds.
The other night, we had leftover Chinese takeout (her leftovers, I ate mine). She asked me what I wanted her to cook for dinner and I reminded her that she has her leftovers. She said “oh yeah, hand it here.” So I gave her the container and I watched her dump it straight into the trash without looking at it. Wide-eyed, I asked her “what are you doing?” She proceeds to inform me that she has come up with a new system: if she tells me 3 times that I can eat her leftovers because she does not intend to come back for them, she will throw it out before it spoils. Apparently that was the 4th time I reminded her about the leftovers so that triggered the disposal. I got quiet to process the fact that she made this decision without talking to me about it, and finally I said she could have told me she was going to throw it out, then I would have eaten it. She firmly thinks that the statute of limitations expired as she told me 3 times I could have them, and she “could do with them what she sees fit.” I would have if I had known she’d toss them instead of conceding in eating them after understanding I truly didn’t mind her eating them herself. I feel like she truly hasn’t listened to/disregarded me feelings/upbringing with food. I told her “do you” and haven’t really talked to her since. So, AITA? 

Tl;dr my wife has decided to throw away leftovers after she offers them to me 3 times and I don’t like wasting food",1
"I (f23) moved in with an older woman, Jean (flike65/70?) because I had to move to a new city for law school last August and housing here sSUCKS so this was the best option. Jean rents out the second story of her home to help her pay for bills. We each have our own spaces but we are pretty cordial and I have been trying to be respectful of her living space. 

However, whenever there IS a problem Jean is extremely passive aggressive. She'll make really snide side remarks, which makes it hard to solve issues if there is one. For ex, she then was passive aggressive about how I didn't help her out in the garden. It's like she expects me to help out like Im a family member. I asked her to tell me outright if she needs help, instead of being passagress but tried to make it clear to not expect me to just start helping out in her side of the house without her asking, since I pay rent just to live upstairs. 

Part of what I pay for utilities is also this recycling service. Jean is very strict about recycling, she has like ten bags for all these different types of recycling materials, and everything needs to be sorting accordingly. I ofc try to be good about recycling but tbh it gets to be a little too much and the last thing I want to do when I get home after being in the library all day is sort through my trash. So I just put everything recycl-y in one bag and put that in the recycling bin. Well Jean has continually been passive aggressive about this but I kind of just ignored it. However, recently she has started looking in the bins, taking out the trash that isnt sorted correctly and putting it in the stairs that lead to my apartment so I can re-sort it. I had a very civil talk with her about this already telling her that I don't have time to be sorting through my recycling and to please not put my trash back upstairs. She offered to sort through my recycling stuff instead so I dont have to so lately I have just been leaving my trash in her place instead. About two days ago, however, I forgot and just took my trash to the bins, and she again put my trash upstairs and the bag broke. It had food inside so when I got home my apartment smelled like shit. I'd had a terrible day already, so I kinda lost it. 

I was very angry, I told her its very weird to look through the trash bin, to sort through my trash and that its unacceptable to put my trash back upstairs. I told her that she can have standards, but to not impose them on me. Also that I pay rent to live here, not to do things as she expects me to do them, especially things that dont affect her in any way.  Anyways, we havent talked since but I overheard her on the phone talking about how disrespectful I was. I def raised my voice at her, which I regret, but I didnt regret telling her my thoughts. I dont think I'm in the wrong here. AITA?

"My wife who has gestational diabetes due to being pregnant. We are visiting my family over seas. She has specific dietary requirements to help her control her blood sugar level, one such requirement is to substitute white rice with alternative rice types. We come from a rice eating culture.

While over seas my mother is in charge of the meals and often buys and preps alternative rice for her.

During a meal today this conversation came up-

Mom: I usually just buy half a kilo of alt. Rice

Sister: half a kilo is a lot! But then I guess everyone can have it at the same time.

Mom:yeah, that means I don’t have to specifically cook rice for someone

My wife took offence to this and thinks my mother is having a go at her.

I’m obviously thinking my mother just meals it’s easier to have everyone eat the same rice, rather than having to cook for any specific person.

We had an argument over this, where I ended up calling my wife, amongst other things… small minded, have no ability to let things slide, hates my mother so interprets things in the most malicious way possible. (They previously had beef).

Am I the asshole here? Or is my wife extra sensitive, maybe due to being pregnant?

For additional context, my mother is aware of my wife’s condition and also aware that she needs alt. Rice, for a about a week she would provide alt. Rice on and off, add small bits of sugar into my wife’s porridge for breakfast, and once bought alt. Rice but paired with something really bad for her condition. Which all leads my wife into thinking that my mother is intentionally sabotaging her diet. I of course thinks these actions can be considered dumb, but hardly malicious, I think my mother wouldn’t intentionally harm her, if only because it’ll also harm the baby.

Another point of frustration is that once I told my mother is provide alt. Rice every meal and stop sneaking sugar. She immediately rectified these issues and my wife blood sugar is well managed now, to which my wife thinks it proves my mother’s maliciousness as it wasn’t hard to do, why didn’t she do it beforehand.

We are both very frustrated… please give your opinion, maybe it’s my fault for not stressing the dietary requirements hard enough…",1
"I was blessed with three beautiful children and unfortunately, my eldest, Brooke, passed away when she was 5 years old. It rocked my world and I know I haven’t been the same since. I went through therapy and still attend to this day, but a part of me died too.

I will never let my daughter be forgotten. I bring pictures of her to events such as holiday celebrations and birthdays. I talk about her all the time. Every year on my living children’s birthdays, I think of her and how her once younger siblings are now older than her. 

My daughter, Marnie, is getting married next month. I asked her if she was having a memorial table and she said no. I asked her about creating a seat for her sister who passed, as she should be a part of the day. Marnie told me no, for once she wants a day about her. She says she couldn’t have one event that wasn’t about Brooke. Even her graduation, I had put a picture of her on the seat. She said I needed to stop making my grief “front stage”.

I told her she was being incredibly selfish and until she goes through a loss like this, she’ll never understand. Marnie asked me if her kids would have to live under the shadow of Brooke too. I told her she should be ashamed and to get over herself.

"I (30,female) married my boyfriend of 13 years in November. Both my father and mother had to fly out for the wedding because of location differences. When planning my wedding I had always planned on having BOTH my parents walk me down the aisle, especially considering my mom was the one that raised me. Having this though, would be complicated because my parents had a messy divorce due to him lying and overall just being abusive. Because of this I waited last minute to tell my dad about the plan, but of course his new wife was not ok with the plan and forced him to say no. 
Having to tell my mother this was awful especially considering she was already nervous about my dad being there. 
So naturally she starts crying when I’m telling her this which made me feel awful. My sister came up with the idea that our dad walks me down the aisle, then my mom stands in the middle and she walks me the rest of the way.  Obviously we thought the idea was stupid but it was either that or her not walking me down the aisle at all. 

There has been insane repercussions because of this, my mother STILL feels like I betrayed her. 

So, AITA? 

EDIT: Ok I understand now that I was in the wrong and that I made bad and rash decisions. But I think people with divorced parents will understand where I’m coming from with inviting my dad. And saying that I don’t love my mom is kind of insane. All of this happened the night before the wedding and it was a destination wedding, the whole thing would have been an even bigger mess if I HAD told him to screw off. ",1

When we were married, he'd tell me to take care of D and when she's with him on the weekends, he's working and doesn't spend time with D at all.

Recently D had a dispute with my husband because he asked her to move over so he could get past, she refused and started arguing with him. I tried to defuse the situation by trying to get D to talk with me in another room, she stayed where she was and I told her that she needs to learn to live with her step family. She screamed that she wanted to live with dad full time, it broke my heart but I called my ex and arranged for her to start living with him.

The thing is, my ex had also remarried but she barely saw her step mom and step siblings because step mom works weekends and D's step siblings go to their father's on the weekend too. EX and her step mom show obvious favoritism to D's step siblings and if she tries to speak out against it, they'll take away her phone and ground her. We don't, while we do give more attention to my step children that is completely age based.

D's step siblings on my ex's side are around the same age as her, my step children are 9. While they can for the most part take care of themselves with regular parental support, they need a little more attention than D does. Two weeks ago, D asked us to come pick her up and explained what was going on, I told her that this is my husband's house too and she needs to respect him, she agreed. We've taken her to therapy and she's being more open about her feelings with us in counseling.  While she's not close to my husband they have been making progress. I've talked to my mother about it and she says I'm a cruel asshole for making my daughter go live with my ex.

So AITA?

Edit: I'm just going to address a few things:

&#x200B;

1. I in no way shape or form expect my daughter to see my husband as her father, personally I don't think my daughter has a father. I do want her to get along with my husband and potentially see him as a father figure in her life in the future, right now all I'm aiming for is for them to get along.
2. No I have not told D that I view her bio father as not her ""real"" father
3. Regarding attention, I do give D attention. After therapy we usually go on mommy dates and I when she request it I spend time with her. The thing is, D as she is 17 is wanting more personal space and distance than 9 year olds. My step children only receive more attention regarding education, we don't need to supervise D and ask her if she's finished her homework.
4. D gets along with her step siblings on my side, she's told me multiple times how she views them as her real brother and sisters.
5. I'm not forcing her to spend time or be close with my husband. They usually only spend time when they are both with my step children. At which they actually are civil and if it has something to do with my step children they actually get along( talks about them, etc).
6. D's therapy is separate from the family counselling. We drive her to her aunt's place for her sessions(online) and  family counselling is at our house(also online) when my step children go to their grandparent's.
7. Regarding D and my husband's relationship, I got married when D was 13, she was kind of shocked at the engagement(I made sure to ask her before I accepted) but was happy for me(made sure to check with her therapist). She was excited about the wedding and then about 3 months into the actual marriage she took a sharp turn, and started acting out. At that point, my husband, D and I(occasionally with the 9s) regularly spent time together. As well as one-on-one time between me and D and occasionally D and my husband. I've tried to take her to a psychiatrist but there wasn't any progress and she would clam up.
8. Regarding husband's emotionally abusive behavior, when D was 6 my ex went through something, he started screaming at me. Then he'd use his crying to try and turn D against me when I didn't do what he asked. I left with D and the divorce took 2 years to be finalized. He got visitation rights on the condition he takes anger management classes and therapy for his trauma. He did the required time and is still going to therapy. I would say he's no longer emotionally abusive(which is the reason I let D go to him on the weekends). The reason I didn't stop D from going to his house is because, I think she's old enough to make her own decisions and I didn't know that they would give D's step siblings THAT much favoritism(thought's it only be from step mom's side), everything regarding what goes on there is being relayed by D.",1
"I have been married to my husband for 15 years. He has a son who is 19 (Joseph, fake name) and I have a daughter who is 24 (Jane, fake name). Jane attempted college but was unfortunately removed from her university. She lived with us for a couple of years after while Joseph was finishing high school. Things got very tense because, while it was never confirmed, Joseph accused Jane of stealing and pawning his game system and stealing prize money he received for a competition. Jane never confessed and we never got in the middle of it for lack of proof. From that time on Joseph and Jane really did not get along.

  
Joseph is saving up to move out on his own but for now he stays with us. Jane lives on her own (by choice) and gets by on disability and food stamps though she does not get much. Unfortunately she lost her disability suddenly. With her housing voucher she pays a couple hundred a month in rent but her disability covered that. Since she has lost her disability, my husband and I have been paying her rent for the last 6 months. She asked Joseph to pay her rent last month to give my husband and I a break and he agreed. Unfortunately she cannot make this month's rent either and she asked Joseph again. This time he refused. I tried to talk him out of his decision, saying that his father and I would pay him back when we have the extra money to do so and he became angry and refused again so I let it be.

  
Now, we have had a monthly family dinner tradition for years and years. One night a month we cook a nice meal together and eat with no distractions and we usually follow up with a game. We really need Jane to come so we can discuss her financial plan and such. Out of fear that an argument would arise between Joseph and Jane, I asked Joseph if he could find some place to go for the evening that our family dinner is planned for. I tried to ask as gently as possible but he blew up. I will admit I let out my frustration as well, arguing that he is totally unsympathetic to his sister's situation which only made him double-down. He angrily agreed to leave but did so with some choice words for me and my husband. That was two nights ago. He hasn't been home since. He's confirmed he's safe but won't talk to either of us.

  
AITA or is Joseph blowing things out of proportion?",1
"I know the title sounds bad but let me provide some context.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost three years. She has always been an attractive girl, but in the past year she started working out more and eating better and had an undeniable glow-up. Her body was always nice but now she's got a yoked back, a poppin' ass and El Capitan abs. On top of that, her lifestyle adjustment has motivated me to do better for myself because I hate having a girlfriend who can squat more than me, so it's a win-win for the both of us.

There's just one issue. Within the past 6 months or so she has gotten real into the whole ""Fitstagram"" life. She's constantly posting videos of herself squatting and doing rows and leg lifts. I don't mind it in theory but the thing is she's always looking hot as fuck in these videos and she's always wearing leggings that show off her ass.

She's already amassed almost 10,000 followers. Dudes regularly slide into her DMs or comment with fire or drooling emojis. She never responds and always shows me and laughs about it, but it makes me really uncomfortable because I know these guys are cracking stick to her videos.

She also has me take a lot of said videos when we go to the gym together which honestly makes me feel like a cuck and the other day I really lost my cool. I was taking a video of her squatting and I thought it looked great. She looked at my recording and asked if I could take it again with more focus on her butt. I asked her if she was serious and she said, ""Yeah, I want to show off my glutes.""

I stood up and gave her her phone back and was just like, ""I'm not doing that. You're not Jen Selter. This is a fucking Planet Fitness. If you want to show off your ass so bad why don't you just make an OnlyFans.""

She actually didn't know what OnlyFans was so I had to explain it to her but when I did she ran into the locker room and refused to come out. She texted me telling me she would Uber home and that I should just leave. It's been two days and she's barely spoken to me and I'm starting to worry about those dudes in her DMs.

I realize it was probably unwise of me to equate having a fitness account with being fucked on camera. I also realize that my freakout probably came as a shock to her because I've never expressed discomfort with her doing this before. But how could I? She was happy and motivated and I didn't want to rain on her parade so I just did my best to deal with it.

Still, I don't understand how she couldn't see that watching thousands of people salivate over her body would be difficult for me, especially when some of them are beefy, bearded, broad-shouldered men. I feel like she shares the majority of the blame for being blind to my feelings, especially because I'm her main photographer and boyfriend and there's not a single mention or picture of me on her account. But then again maybe I'm just insecure. AITA?",1
"Saw another post that reminded me of this situation.

A few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. Her husband is a light black man. Of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. The skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.

I pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. She didn’t even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. I reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. Neither has spoken to me since.

I’ve always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they’re still married and sometimes I feel bad about what happened. I just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because I would be devastated if I wasn’t confident that I was the father of my future children. Was I an asshole for asking privately?

Edit- okay I get it I’m an asshole. I want to make it clear that I didn’t think the triplets had different fathers. I’m not an idiot. I thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair",1
"My (30m) gf ""Tera"" (29f) works in healthcare and makes about 6 figures a year. She has been saving a little bit of money out of each paycheck since she started working at 15 for what she decided would be her ""stupid money"" - essentially money that she couldn't spend on anything practical and had to be something fun. The rule she set was she had to spend the money when she was 30. I know all this because she has brought it up pretty often over the 3 years we have been together.

Honestly, I have been excited to see what she would do with all the money she has saved. Today, she came over and told me she had something exciting to tell me. She had decided what to do with her ""stupid money"". The grand plan she had come up with was a Disney trip. Which, initially, I was like ""ok, whatever, her family lived near Disney World when she was growing up, I can understand her wanting to use some of the money for a few days there"".

But she wasn't talking about just going to Disney World. Her grand plan for spending the money she's been saving for almost 15 years, was to do all the Disneylands in the world. Tokyo, California, Paris, and apparently there's one or two in China as well. She asked me what I thought, and I had to be honest, so the conversation went something like this:

""That sounds like a trip a 7 year old would plan, do you seriously want to waste your money on that?""

""What do you mean, it would be so fun!""

""For a 7 year old. You could spend part of your money on a trip to Disney World or whatever, but I would really rather be going somewhere that was for adults and actually had some kind of culture.""

""Well, we wouldn't just be going to the parks, we would spend a few days in each of the cities too.""

I then had to tell her how that made no sense. Take Tokyo for example, she was planning on spending three days in the Disney park and four days in Tokyo proper. One of the greatest cities in the world, and she wanted to waste almost half her time in an overpriced theme park?

We argued back and forth for a while, and she ended up leaving. She called me a few hours ago to tell me that if I didn't want to go, she was going to take her sister as a HS graduation present, but that I was being an AH about the trip she had planned for us. I feel like she may be the AH for trying to take back taking me on a trip, but I may be the AH for being honest and telling her I thought her idea was kind of ridiculous for an adult.

Edit: Wanted to clear up some confusion I was seeing, although it seems I will be labeled the AH no matter what at this point.

About work/time off: I work \~6 months of the year and technically have the rest of the year off, although I typically choose to work from home part time during those months, which I could do from any country as it isn't location/time dependent. So, taking the time off would not have been an issue for me. As for Tera, she is allowed to take off pretty much as long as she wants so long as it is scheduled with her hospital long enough in advance. It does not count as PTO, so she would not be receiving pay and if she isn't receiving pay, they don't care.

Tera being a Disney Adult: I wasn't really familiar with this term before this, to be honest. As far as I know, she wouldn't be classified as one. She hasn't been to Disney World in something like four years, and while we both watch the occasional Disney movie or TV show, I wouldn't say she is obsessed to the level of what a Disney adult apparently is.

Cost: She was going to cover 100% of the cost of air, travel, wifi, hotels, food, and entertainment. I was only going to pay for incidentals like souvenirs. ",1
"Long story short something happened at work that has been both extremely distressing and embarrassing for me. The situation is still in the midst of being resolved and I have been racked with incredible anxiety and depression since. It's something that I am thinking about literally every minute of every day and I feel like I am at a low point in my life. Sorry for being purposefully vague. 

With that background, my girlfriend's uncle and aunt are visiting her parents who live about 30 minutes away for President's Day weekend. We have been dating for two years and she deeply desires that I come to dinner with them so I can do the whole meet and greet. 

I flat out have zero desire to do this. I really don't want to have to put on this happy/polite face and pretend like my life is fine. Especially since I know these people will more than likely be asking me a ton of questions about my life. I don't want to be put into a position where I have to talk about what happened at work, or have to lie about it. I know my girlfriend has already told her mother about what happened which means at least two people at dinner are going to know I am BSing or whitewashing my life situation. I don't want to spend this weekend feeling self-conscious or embarrassed. 

My girlfriend is upset because she thinks this could be the only opportunity I have to meet them and that ""I don't have to talk about [my work situation] with them."" Because of my current circumstances I think it's highly unlikely that my work situation/future doesn't come up.

AITA for not wanting to meet my girlfriend's relatives considering my present life circumstances and mental state?",1
"I (20F) got in an argument with my mother (55F) and although I am sure I'm justified I would like you guys' opinion. During the argument I told her she doesn't do enough to help me and I need her to act like an actual parent. 
For context I am depressed, and I wish my mom would do more to help me. I've told her that i need more help multiple times in the past months. She tells me she wishes she knew what to do. She calls me weekly and books my medical appointments with a psychiatrist but doesn't do more. We live far appart and I can only see her every couple months.
I know she is doing her best so that is why I feel bad for being mean to her. Furthermore I'm not an easy child as my issues started in my early teens and i dealt with them on my own until I was 18. Because of that I am mean and rude to her when we argue and I'm not sure I'd ever accept any authority from her. So aita for asking her to act like a parent and do more ?

Edit : here is some additional info I've said in the comments so you don't have to ask about it. 
I have had issues since I'm 12 and I dealt with them alone until 18. My mom was emotionally neglectful and didn't do anything when I was being abused in front of her. We have come a long way since I told her about how I feel age 18 because I started discussing in depth the way I felt as a teen. I started therapy by myself one year before ever telling her anything via university infrastructures. I want a good relationship with her.  I wish for her to not be too disappointed if I fail school again because of my mental health.",1
"My in-laws are what you would call traditional. They seem to think the world should have stopped 50 years ago, and think everthing since then is evil. They aren't racist (that I know of) or outwardly bigoted, but they just are very old fashioned. 

My husband and I have three children (16f, 14f, 10m) and we go to visit all their grandparents since they live close. Here's the issue, they don't like the idea of women wearing pants. My MIL says it's ""showing off"" and my FIL always says it isn't christian. Now I'm pretty feminine, so I don't mind throwing on a dress when we stop by, but our daughters are not.

They don't like visiting my husbands parents, which breaks his heart, because we make them put on a dress before they go. They are both pretty tomboyish, and they never wear any dresses otherwise. I had to but each of them a few dresses specifically so they can go. To be clear it's not like they aren't allowed over if they wear pants, it's just that they won't shut up the entire time about how much they hate it.

Our daughters hate this, and think it's unfair. I guess it is, but in a lot of cultures women only wear skirts and dresses so I don't think it's a big deal. Plus it isn't like it hurts them to wear a dress a few times a week for a few hours. The issue is our oldest is planning to never speak to her grandparents again after she's 18, and I'm worried it's affecting them.",1
" Throwaway for obvious reasons.

My girlfriend and I have been together for over 2 years. She has always been very neat, tidy, and very polished. She cares about her appearance, and I appreciate that.

So this situation makes no sense to me.

We were at a very fancy event with a few of my friends (social distancing rules, every one wore masks etc.) My girlfriend was wearing a beautiful white dress, which I recently bought for her. The dress was very expensive.  We were all having a good time.

However, at one point, she excused herself to go the bathroom, and then I didn't see her again until she sent me a text from the car asking if we could go home.

Obviously I'm slightly annoyed because I didn't want to leave so soon. When I reached the car and asked why she wanted to go home, she told me that she got her period unexpectedly. I asked why she didn't bring extra tampons or pads (or use those tracking apps) she tried to defend herself by saying that she did everything she could, and that she had a period stain, and didn't want to stay because of the stain. 

She asked me to lie to my friends, and tell them that she was feeling  ""unwell"" so that she could go home. She had a man's jacket (a mutual friend of ours) covering her legs (and the nasty stain) and pleaded with me to take her home so she could shower and unwind.

I took her home and lied to my friends. When she was getting out of the car, the stain was very noticeable, it was very big and essentially ruined an expensive dress which I bought. She also made me purposefully lie because she wasn't prepared enough, and made me miss an event with my friends. Needless to say, I was extremely pissed. 

She said I was not being considerate and went to go lie down because she had a ""headache"" (she wanted to lie down after she took a shower)

She woke up and I haven't spoken to her properly until she apologizes, and gives back the friends jacket. I don't think I'm an AH, but when I told my friend (the same friend who gave her a jacket) he told me that I was the AH, and my GF kind of agreed.

AITA?

EDIT: I guess I'm the AH. I logged out of this account about an hour after posting because the response was terrible, and then came back to a TON of responses calling me the AH.

After my girlfriend came home from returning the jacket, she apologized for ruining the dress and I apologized for being a dumbas and not understanding the whole 'period' thing. She forgave me, then we went out for ice cream and rewatched her favorite movie. That's the end of the story.",1
"Edited details in parenthesis for clarity of communication.

My employer has a fitness facility for employees for free. They have group fitness classes and a good sized gym with the usual equipment. 

I’m returning to running longer races after hiatus for a few years. I’m needing to build a base of just getting my body back to running for an extended period of time. When a group exercise class called run/jog/walk started I was excited. Yay, accountability from a group! 

I’ve always run solo or with someone who was a better runner than I, so I was nervous about how the group was going to be run. Does everyone run? Jog?Walk? Or do people do their own thing? 

I talked to the organizer about inclement weather and they insisted it will be outside no matter what. I asked if we could use the numerous treadmills, so everyone could go at their own pace. Nope. 

The first session, no one shows up but me, and I really forgot cold weather gear. I run on the treadmill. Other folks join me. Organizer is huffy about it but join me eventually. Good time had by all. 

The second session, more folks join. I didn’t have sunscreen or a hat (I’m on meds that cause extreme sun sensitivity) so I run inside again. Organizer is annoyed at me (for staying inside even though I explain about meds)but I ignore them (stay indoors). They go outside.

After the session, Participant A shares they run 3 miles before the group meets up so they can get their exercise needs met. Participant B, shares they weren’t happy with the pace they were walking, and wanted to speed up. Participant C and D were in their 70s and joined but stated they didn’t want to hold folks back. Organizer insisted all is well. 

Organizer confided to me later on, they were annoyed that anyone would want to go ahead of the group and it was discouraging and not inclusive. 

WIBTA if I tell Organizer that they should switch the group to indoors so that everyone can go at their own pace? Folks who are walking for company can do that, folks who want to run can do that etc. 

Additional context: Organizer is a  person who’ve shared their fitness and physical appearance struggles with me a bit. They are competitive and dealing with a stress fracture from doing too many miles too soon. They are changing careers to the fitness industry and recently was given negative feedback about their performance at this fitness facility. Their programming hasn’t been too popular. (I think the times have been bad). If this program is successful, it would give them some confidence. 

I am twice their age, not their direct supervisor, they make more than me, not their personal friend. We are the same gender but I am a WOC. 

Thanks so much for your input!",1
"I (43M) have been with my partner (42F) for a little over 3 years and lived together about 2.5 years. I’ve never wished her Happy Mother’s Day because she’s not my mother and we don’t have children. She has an adult child of her own. I also have made it clear that I don’t celebrate Valentine’s Day and I won’t celebrate an anniversary unless we were to get married. I know she doesn’t like this and would prefer to celebrate, but we’ve mostly just agreed not to. 

She’s upset with me this year because I wished my sister and sister in law Happy Mother’s Day but still didn’t tell her. I just don’t see why it’s that big of a deal or why it matters. It just seems like she’s getting upset over the smallest things.",1
"My coworker 55m has a sweater that he wears everyday at work and leaves in the office overnight. He NEVER takes it home to wash and over the last month it has developed a distinct smell.

At first I tried to make innocuous comments to him (""Do you smell something musty?"" etc )

But he didn't catch on so last week I said to him ""Hey that sweater is starting to give off a stench, could you take it home and wash it?"" He replied ""Nah that's not my sweater"" and walked away which effectively ended the conversation.

After he left one night I went to his desk and smelled the sweater and confirmed that nasty stank and it was so putrid up close (I have no idea how he lives like this)

So I took the sweater on my way out and threw it in a dumpster out back.

The next day he was looking around for it and asking everyone if they had seen it. I just shrugged and said ""Nah haven't seen it today"" (which was technically not a lie)

I feel kinda bad but I can't live like that. We work in a 7 person office with no HR and our boss is not effective at dealing with issues do I felt like this was my only option. AITA?

CLARIFICATION: when he said ""that's not my sweater"" he was referring to the stink not being his sweater. The sweater was in fact his (he's a bit of an oddball, but I can't imagine even he would wear a random stinky sweater that he didn't own)

Edit: I see a lot of people suggesting that I had other options, and the ideas being brought up are frankly asinine.

""Just spray some freeze and call it a day!""
Have you ever sprayed febreeze is a bathroom where someone took a dump? Then you know it just combines with the shit smell and almost gives it a sort of power up. Next!

""Tell HR about it""
Some people have trouble reading it seems. I already said it's a small office with no HR. And our boss is incapable or unwilling to address situations like this. I did in fact bring it up to him and he said to ""find a compromise"" such as allowing him to wear the sweater 3 days a week. Not a problem solver this guy

""Take it home and wash it for him""
I don't think this one even warrants a response. I suppose I should ask the rest of the office if they have any laundry for me to take home so I can do it all at once?

Edit 2:
I see many people bringing up the legality of this and the police being called or this going to court. May I remind everyone we're talking about a sweater? I'd love to hear how that 911 call goes. ""Officer! I need to report a missing sweater! Please send your forensics team out ASAP and track this lunatic down before the sweater thief strikes again!

Or God forbid I get taken to sweater court! I hope the honorable Judge Cardigan takes pity on me and offers a reduced sentence if I do people's laundry while in prison.

Get real people. Were talking about office squabbles, not grand theft sweater

UPDATE:

Hey all, before the update I just wanted to apologize for getting so defensive in my original post. I've been feeling really stressed about the situation and I think my guilt expressed itself as anger. Even though I still don't agree with the alternative actions people offered I should have been more chill about it.

So the update: We have a Monday morning meeting every week. I had planned to pull my coworker aside at lunch to tell him what happened and explain why I felt it was necessary. At yesterday's meeting my coworker took the opportunity during Other Business to bring up his sweater. He said that he felt disrespected and as multiple people have complained to him about the smell he hasn't been able to narrow down his suspects so he needs a full confession or he will be taking further measures. I thought about confessing but tbh his eyes had a crazy look and it made me feel unsafe so I kept my mouth shut. When no one said anything he stormed out of the office. My boss predictably did nothing 🙄

A couple hours later he returned with a guy who he said was his cousin and a police officer (though he was in normal clothes and had no badge or ID?). He said his cousin was going to be interrogating people individually all day. 

At this point my boss finally stepped in and said that wasn't happening and brought my coworker into his office. I don't know what happened in there but it got loud towards the end and I didn't see him for the rest of the afternoon.

I found out the next day he was fired. Not exactly the outcome I wanted but it does solve my problem!",1
"My ex husband and I divorced when our son was 3 months old. His leaving blindsided me because he really wanted a child with me. Anyway, a month after the divorce, he introduced me to his girlfriend and announced that they were 8 months pregnant. I was also informed that he was moving 3 hours away for a better paying job. So for the first 4 years of my son's life, we had one weekend a month arrangement with his dad. When my son was 6 months old, I met my husband. My husband really loves my son and did all the things a typical dad does. After 4 years, my ex moved back and we settled into a every weekend arrangement. In the meanwhile, I married my husband and we had 2 kids together. 

My ex husband was terrible as a partner, but he did eventually step up and became a decent dad to our son. My husband felt hurt by their new dynamic, but took a step back to allow my son to have a relationship with his biological father.

I think it's important to mention that when ex lived 3 hours away, my husband offered to adopt our son. Ex was offended by my husband's request and immediately moved back to our town. He said that he wouldn't let any other man steal his firstborn and only son. My husband was hurt, but we let it go. 

Fast forward to the present, my ex husband passed away in a drunk driving accident (he was the one hit by the drunk driver). His girlfriend is pregnant with their fourth. My son was really said about his biological dad passing away, but he's a tough kid and has quickly adapted with the change. My husband, who he calls dad, took charge and resumed his full fledged daddy role. Our family has become whole again and my husband no longer feels sad about losing his son. My son and my husband feel totally secure in their relationship as father and son. 

We have now decided as a family that it was time for my husband to officially adopt my son. My son wants the same and is happy about becoming a ""Williams"" like the rest of our family. With my ex husband being out of the picture, we no longer need his consent to start with the adoption process. He was vehemently against it. We also plan to move to another state halfway across the country where there are better schools for our kids and better career prospects. My kids are excited about the move and we are now looking at new houses. 

Here comes the complication, my ex husband's mother is furious about the adoption and our move. She wants her grandchildren to grow up together and doesn't want to lose her grandchild. Honestly, I empathize with her and even though she treated me terribly during our marriage, I understand where she's coming from. I told her that I plan to bring my son around for the holidays and that we will visit her when we can. She called me heartless and said that I lacked empathy for her and my ex's girlfriend. I offered my condolences but remained firm in my decision as I believe this move will benefit our children immensely. 

AITA?


Edit : My son will turn 10 next month. Ex passed away 8 months ago. 
 
The thought which contributed towards our decision of going ahead with the adoption asap : 
If I were to end up dead tomorrow, my son would legally become an orphan. My husband, the man who raised him since he was a baby wouldn't have any rights as a father. With his biological father gone, it makes sense for my husband to step up and take on the role. I don't want to die tomorrow and have my family break apart because my husband didn't adopt my son. I could easily die in a freak accident and leave my son without any support. That's not what me and my husband want.",1
"V invited me to a party. she invited Q & P, who are our friends, as well as her other friends that Q, P & i didnt know personally, but V told all of us from the start that she will be inviting other friends as well. i told them many times that i was worried cus of my social anxiety, but i thought that id be ok if all 3 of my friends were there

2 days before the party, Q tells me that shes not going. Ps an extrovert & the ppl there are all close friends of Vs. if P & V talk to other ppl, id be alone & anxious etc. + the fact that i knew id be very drained & that i needed to do smt else that day, i decided to not go. i told V that i needed to smt that day

V then says in the gc that some1 lied to her. she blasted me in the gc & sent a pic of my dms w/ Q, where i told Q i wasnt going if she wasnt going as well. i tried to explain myself, but V said she wouldnt read it & called me a liar. i could see how my msgs to Q could seem like the reason i gave V was a lie, but i just didnt think i needed to tell her everything

i also went to Qs party few weeks back, so V said that it was clear i preferred Q, which is false. i love all my friends, but Vs & Qs party were different. Qs party was w/ ppl i know & i had alr spent money. i even privately msgd V that i didnt want to go if V wasnt going, but i went anyway cus of what i stated. after the exp w/ Qs party that made me feel drained, i decided not to go to Vs. V called me a liar, insulted & swore at me.

then, M said in the gc that he was mad that i made a ur mom joke to him in the past. when he said that he didnt like the joke, i apologised & then again when he brought it up in the gc. i explained to him that this was the sense of humor i had w/ my other friend group & i didnt know he wasnt okay w/ it & it was my fault for not checking w/ him first. then he said that i twisted the narrative & told me to “stop that habit entirely”. i agreed to not say it in front of him & he got mad that id say it in front of other ppl. my other friends say them to me too. V & M said that i had no respect for my parents. i told them i do respect parents, i wouldnt allow for ppl to insult my parents, but my friends & i know that we dont mean it cus its just a joke

when im upset at M, M calls me sensitive & overreactive, invalidating me. i told M, if i can respect that he didnt like those jokes, why doesnt he respect that i dont like that? M replied w/ swears that he called me sensitive to insult me, but ur mom jokes insults the parent. ive never called any of my friends names, cus i know it hurts. when we argue, im always the 1st one to apologise, M usually doesnt apologise, i simply forgive him cus idw lose him as a friend. V also said that every fight is me (which is false), prob to say that im the problem. it felt like noone was listening, so i deleted all my msgs & left the gc

they haven't contacted me after that. its been ab 2 days. they prob think its all my fault & dont want to talk to me again. aita?",1
"Hey all, throw away here.

So the situations this. A person I know of used kickstarter to fund a project. He works hard for what he does and hes pretty decent at it I suppose. Anyways the kickstart was successful. And he received way more then what he originally asked for. Which is pretty awesome. Its kind of neat to see his project take off and to see that people like it.

Over beers one night he starts talking about his plans. Obviously I assume his intentions are to produce what people payed for. But then he goes into detail about how he wants to use a large part of the kick starter money to fund some other projects of his which are in no way related to what he got the money for, and are not for any other kind of kickstarter thing as far as I am aware. Part of this would also basically be paying his bills for how ever long he has the money for given that hes basically unemployed.

I was kind of disgusted by the whole thing and the way he talked about it. In my mind if you pay for a kick starter a vast majority of the money should go towards the product to give the people the very best that you can give. I mean sure maybe pay your rent once in a blue moon. Or use it to pay for groceries while you work or something. But he seems to want to use more then the bare minimum to survive. In his words he should ""receive a wage for his services."" Which feels wrong to me. You should not be making money off this thing. Once the products done with thats when you should hopefully start receiving a wage for your services once the product hits the shelves. Instead of this weird double dipping thing.  ( Least that's how it feels like to me. )

He was trying to make a case to make this sound right. And I said sure its alright if your an individual that lacks morals. Which naturally he took offense by and it kind of ended the night.

I might have missed it in the rules someplace on kickstarter. But it seems like this might be alright if he gets the product out? I dont use the service ever and admittedly only skim read the rules they had posted.

Hes now on another project much larger in scope and it really just feels like a cash grab at this point. Was I the asshole for insulting him like that?",1
"16m

I hate my schools food and I can't leave school for lunch until next year and I don't want the food my parents buy and they know that. Literally my dad gets postmates everyday and I should have it to. I told my dad to text me what place he's getting lunch from so I can get something to and have it delivered to my school in my name. 

He said no. I said it's not fair he's ordering sushi and gyros for lunch and I get dog food. He doesn't care that I don't eat.

Edit: What if I buy sushi stuff but want pancakes instead?

Edit: Its almost lunch and I want a milkshake and fries. In n out is right by school. My school lunch is nasty taco which doesn't even fill me up",1
"Christmas was a few weeks ago, but I'm still getting shit for this. Throwaway for my anonymity. 

Me (29M) and my girlfriend (25F) recently Christmas together. We've been together for two years, but this is the first time we've celebrated together. We both decided to exchange lists and we each got a couple things from the list to keep up with the ""surprise"" of it all. 

My girlfriend's list was very descriptive. A couple of the items were ""Nars foundation"" with her color, ""Lush bath bombs"", and ""Puma running shoes"". Just to name a few. I was happy to get her these things, but I didn't, and still don't, get the obsession with the brands. 

For Christmas, I did most of the shopping at Target for everyone, not just her. They didn't have a lot of the specific brands she wanted, but I got her what I found and what I thought she would like. I got her a bottle of foundation in her color, it was from the brand wet and wild. I got her a big bag of Dr. Teals bath bombs, which I know are a good brand since I use the salts often. I also got her a pair of running shoes. I can't remember the brand name, but they looked fine to me and we're in her size. I also got her a couple other things, but I just listed these to save time. 

On Christmas day, she seemed a bit confused opening the presents, but thanked me nonetheless. Later that night, she asked if I had trouble reading her handwriting or if I was confused about the list. I picked up on her talking about the brands and I just told her I don't think we should buy brands just for the name, rather the quality and price of their products. Since these products are cheaper, and she got more bang for her buck, like with the bath bombs, I didn't see an issue. The price I paid for a whole bag would have only gotten me one from the company she wanted me to buy from. She got a bit cold after that and said next year we just shouldn't do lists since I don't want to gift her what she wanted. We argued for a bit more, and more or less dropped the issue after a couple days. However, I'm still getting a comment or two from her and now I'm wondering if I was in the wrong.",1
"Obligatory throwaway acc notice - my family uses Reddit and I don’t need more arguments right now 

I (48M) am the father to two daughters: Elise (19F) and Mia (16F). I love them both more than anything but they are very different people. 

Elise graduated a year early from high school two years ago with enough credits to take off a year from college,  so she’ll be graduating next year (it’s complicated I know). She has been dating the same boy since they were both 17 and they have made it work long-distance. I’ll admit she is very trustworthy, reliable, and doesn’t ask for much. Very hardworking and never got in trouble in school. All around good kid. 

Mia is a bit of a different story. She is incredible, very smart, but hasn’t been the easiest in high school. Got suspended twice in her freshman and sophomore year for doing stupid stuff, and has had several boyfriends over the last year, made some poor decisions with a few of them, etc. Now she is dating a guy who is 19 and dropped out of college last year. i love her no matter what but am not blind to her poor decision making. 


Since the school year ended, Elise came back home. She has a job at a hospital lined up for the summer but doesn’t start for another week, and her boyfriend asked her last month if she wanted to go on a road trip across the US with him (which was last week). Elise asked and we were hesitant, but she presented us with detailed travel plans, so we said they could go. 

The problem came up on Tuesday last week, after Elise left Monday. I was with Mia, and she mentioned how excited she was to go on a trip with her boyfriend. I figured she meant in a couple years, but she told me they were looking to travel together in early July for a few weeks. 

I have some problems with this. To be frank, I think Mia is too young and too reckless to go on a trip like that. For legal reasons, she doesn’t have an active license, so she would be relying on this kid she’s only known for a little to get around. When I told her that I wouldn’t be ok with her going on a trip, she got very angry and told me it was unfair that I allowed Elise to go but wouldn’t let her.

After thinking about it I realized I was setting a dangerous precedent in letting Elise go. On Wednesday, about a quarter of the way through their trip, I told Elise she had to come home. She resisted  it, but I told her she had to, so she came home on Thursday. 

I have never seen her this upset. I tried to explain to her that this is the only way I can make it fair since I won’t let Mia go. She told me that it may be equal, but it’s not fair because she earned this trip and her sister didn’t. My wife feels like I punished Elise for her sister’s mistakes by making her come home instead of just telling Mia no. I just wanted to make it fair for both of my girls so that one of them doesn’t get more than the other. AITA?!",1
"I(24F) have known N(26M) sense high school. We are very close and have one of those relationships where we basically are siblings in a way. More so with that weird “we don’t talk on the phone that often but if we are together it’s like we’ve been messaging for days” kind of relationship ya know? 

His gf G(23F) became my friend sometime after He introduced her to me. We were a bit bumpy at first due to him apparently running to comfort me when I left my ex and how close N and I were when we first met but I explained to her that for the comforting thing, I had no clue he even tried to do that. I actually told him off for that because while it was hard I was the one who made the decision and I had my own family there. He did apologize to G and explained his side that it was mainly cause he knew I was already not fully ok because 2 month earlier my eldest brother died and he just wanted to make sure I was all good. G and I understood this and all was good. 

Catch up to now, G and I are pretty damn close, I’d almost say closer than N is with me. Thing is G has filled me in with everything N has been doing wrong and I knew he wasn’t perfect, emotionally wise I knew he wasn’t always there but the extent to things is very… much. And I wouldn’t believe her off the bat if he himself didn’t admit to doing these things to me as well. Recently N has made it seem like he just doesn’t fully care about the relationship despite the fact that he does, but he isn’t thinking.(he never has fully thought things though) He has ADHD and is unmedicated because his family doesn’t view it as a problem/agree with using meds for something like that but it’s a very clear problem at this point. There’s is a lot of stuff he’s been kinda dropping the ball on with them like intimacy, helping around the house, making stupid choices that has almost led him to jail or G braking up with him because of an attempt to make more money (tried to catfish people for cash, he’s done it before but not when dating) and it’s all coming to a head. 

I want to be there for both of them, help them out but idk what to do. I really wanna warn N that G is ready to leave him like, tomorrow but I’m not sure if I should or not. 

On one hand I feel like I’d be the AH for telling him cause G trusted me to vent to me about these things. She needed a shoulder to cry on and I wanted to be there for her. On the other hand I also feel I’d be the AH cause I’ve known N for so long and with how close we are I feel like I’d be a genuine stab in the back if I didn’t tell him what was going on. I’ve warned him before when he was messing up, but this? This is a whole new thing. 

Any suggestions would be so appreciated

Edit to add: I forgot to mention, I have suggested N look into therapy for help with his disconnect with people, but also because he confided in me that he’s depression was getting worse and had thoughts of suicide/and attempt that failed. He said he’d think about it but as it stands he ain’t going till next month because it has been court ordered due to the jail thing I mentioned. ",1
Partner asked me to help pay half of the cosmetic surgery she is planning. I initially agreed when I was financially well off. Then stuff happened and now im kinda not Financially well. I told her I would help at the second half of the month when I get paid. Well  they had made plans to get this stuff done for upcoming date. I told em that the start of the month is no good because I need to pay rent. They got angry with me saying that I should of told them that if I can't help to say it and instead of making her plan stuff out. I did not know what to say so I stayed quiet and she stormed off. So am I the ass hole for not clearly stating that I won't be helping and not explaining my current financial issues? ,1
"My wife  (33F) and I (36M) are expecting our first child and I couldn't be more excited.

The issue is with her father. Her biological parents split up when she was 1 year old and since then she has been between two dysfunctional households until she was 18. She has somehow turned out an amazing human however her parents lack some emotional maturity.

Without going over the many ups and downs over the course of their life, ill focus on our wedding where this started.

\- He said he  'didn't feel welcome' at the wedding despite us hand delivering a wedding invitation over a homemade meal. We didn't speak for 2 months over this. Finally he booked his flights to come

\- He decided to fly into our wedding 6pm the night before. Being too busy doing final wedding organization, we asked him to take a 30minute taxi from the airport but later we could catch up for a beer - he never replied to my calls/text for that beer

\- The next morning I see my wife-to-be crying before our pre-wedding breakfast because the father-in-law was complaining about not being collected from the airport. I intervened and settled the situation down, but warned him to behave at his daughters wedding.

\- After the wedding I expected a sign from him that we could talk about these disagreements, however after 6 months passed with no sign of him reaching out, I decide to call him and express my disappointment with his behavior. This started an argument blaming me for being upset that did not conclude to any resolution. I reached out 2 more times, each time the conversations had the same outcome

\- He has not tried to contact me once in year, and the few times he has contacted my wife it was a similar disagreement ending in a fight.

\- Hurtful comments he stated were ""you're not welcome in the family', 'its my (husbands) problem that I'm upset', 'i close the book on the relationship with you (husband)'.

We are now expecting our first kid in under a month and we want our son to have a grandpa. I feel like introducing him to the grandchild gives into his behaviour where he feels he won this argument (he is an ex-marine everything is about war)

We are in this weird stalemate where we cant come to any sort of agreement/functional relationship. He continues to ignore us. The fact this issue escalated over a taxi ride bewilders me.

AITA?

TLDR: Father-in-law was acting poorly at our wedding over a year ago, he didn't take responsibility for his actions now we are having a kid and I don't have the urge to introduce our son to him.

"
I (47M) recently found out that my 16-year-old daughter had a secret Instagram account. I was furious when I found out because I think social media is dangerous for someone her age. She is naive. I saw that she was talking to a few men significantly older than her on the account. 

I immediately took away her phone and grounded her for two weeks. To make sure she doesn't make another account, I also forced her to give me the password for all her social media accounts, including Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat. I check her accounts every day to make sure she's not posting anything inappropriate or talking to strangers.

My daughter is really upset about this and says she deserves privacy, but I don't think she's mature enough to handle social media responsibly. I've seen too many stories on the news about teens being cyberbullied, scammed, or even kidnapped by strangers they met online.

My daughter keeps insisting that I am overreacting. AITA for controlling my daughter's social media?

UPDATE: 

Since I've made this post I have been able to read most of your comments. I was angry at first, in my mind I was only trying to protect my daughter. I did have a real conversation with her after I made this post. She is no longer grounded for two weeks. I told her right now I need time to think about if I even should punish her. We had a conversation about safety. I am still keeping her passwords to her social media for now until I can trust her to be safe. I am going to set her up with a therapist. There is clearly something up here, and I may not be the person she wants to tell. Anymore suggestions are appreciated. I will continue to read the replies.",1
"I(M29) had a child when I was 19. I wasn't ready to be a dad and I asked her to get an abortion. She refused and we decided she could keep the baby and I'll pay child support but I wouldn't be involved in her life. I didn't tell my family about it. 3 months ago when I was at work I received a lot of angry messages from my parents asking me if I have a child. apparently my ex had told them everything because she is sick and wants someone to look after the kid since her own family refused to do this. They were mad at me, telling me It was very selfish to hide their grandchild from them(I'm an only child and she is their only grandchild) they agreed to look after her and brought her into our home (yes I live with my parents to help them with the expenses) I told them that I can't stop them from doing this but I still don't want to be her dad and they agreed. She has been living with us for the past 3 months but everyone forgot about our agreement. Two days ago my parents left her with me to go somewhere. I told them I don't want to babysit but no one listened to me. As soon as they left she started coming into my bedroom with different excuses. I finally got annoyed and told her to go to her room and not to come out until her grandparents come home. My parents came back and freaked out when they found out. They called me an AH for being a ""horrible dad"" but I never wanted to be a dad and I made it clear several times. Aita?",1
"Husband and I met in college. Before that he dated “Millie” from ages 14-17. When I first met his family, they all seemed to be in awe of me and it was quite awkward so he explained that his family (and most people in his life prior to college) believed him and Millie would be together forever. I was uncomfortable but he assured me that he “loves me and only me”. We had a few fights over things his friends said but ultimately it was clear that we were being dumb. 

I didn’t have any problems related to Millie for several years. Everyone seemed to have moved on.

Husband and I now have 3 kids. My middle son (6) is in the same grade as Millie’s son. They are in different classes and I only found out about this after my MIL passively mentioned it. 

The moms in my son’s class created a groupchat. A couple days ago Millie contacted me and asked if I could add her into this groupchat and said that she and her son are having trouble connecting with the other moms/kids and it would be a huge help. I was a bit confused as to why she was asking me for permission, and how she got my number but I quickly realized that the other moms probably told her and out of consideration for me wanted her to ask me? I’m not sure. Most of these women grew up with Millie so they know “everything.”

I told her that I can’t really stop anyone if they wanted to add her but I’d rather she not join. Besides, it’s a class groupchat and her son isn’t in it. 

She got upset and asked if I’m only saying no because of her history with my husband. I said well yeah. She then said I’m being sensitive and petty. I told her that I’m uncomfortable. She said not everything is about me and I’m being selfish. I made a sarcastic comment about protecting my peace before firmly telling her she won’t change my mind and that neither she or her son are my responsibility. Millie got even angrier and said that I’m the only person still hung up over their relationship and that I need to grow up and stop being so insecure. She also accused me of being elitist? 

She’s still at it and will tell anyone that’ll listen about how I’m being selfish and how I’m so hung up over the past. My husband thinks we’re all being ridiculous. He was joking when he said that but idk. One of the moms in the groupchat privately asked me about the whole thing and she just said “hmm” so I really don’t know, but they said they weren’t going to add her unless I “gave my permission.” AITA?

Edit:

I understand that I’m the asshole. I do feel a little crazy but I can’t deny that I’m not uncomfortable no matter all the “you do realize he married you” comments. I’ll still let the other moms know that they can add her and not to let me stop them as I’m being a little silly. 

You can tell me that I did wrong without making assumptions and wishing things on me and my kids. Regardless, I appreciate the advice and plan on learning from this. ",1
"Me and my sister used to be close, but when I was 5 and she was 7, I got sick up until I was 15. Because I was sick, my parents often stopped her from doing normal things on my account; at first, I was ok with her doing kid stuff. But at one point I got bitter and kind of guilt-tripped my parents and her to let her stay with me, but I did that up until I was 12; after i noticed that it was leading to  a strain in our relationship and her hating me, I tried to get back on her good side because she was no longer enthusiastic to stay with me like before, when we would play games and she would sing and do things with me, I tried to convince my parents to let her do stuff because she would come back from school then spend 5 -7 hours with me then go home and that cycle would would repeat itself. but my parents still insisted on it and thought I was being brave, even though I would beg them to let her have a life.

When I turned 15, I had surgery and was doing better, but I was still dealing with some side effects from the drugs I was taking, but that only lasted for a year. My parents had finally let her do things that she wanted to do. This was like midway through her junior year. But the damage was already done; she had stopped communicating with me and my parents. Like when we'd sit down to dinner and she'd only say one word to my parents and then lock the door to her room. and she did not have any friends; she told my aunt, and my aunt told my parents, because she was worried about her mental health. My parents tried to do family therapy before she left for college, but she still didn't communicate (she can literally spend a whole month without saying a word to anyone).

When she went to college, she cut off our parents and me. She changed her number and everything. Last year, after doing some research, I found her on Instagram (she seemed much happier there), found out her university, and applied there. I wanted to rekindle our relationship now that she seemed to be in a better mental space. Last semester, I contacted her through her university email and told her we could meet for coffee. She ignored all of my emails. This year, I decided to be more direct, so I went to her student organization and told her hi; she ignored me, but her friends asked who I was, and I told them I was her sister, and they seemed surprised because she didn't mention me. She then told me we should go to a cafe. and she chewed me out for picking this university (she referred to it as her safe place). I am now feeling like I may have gone about this the wrong way, but at the same time, I just wanted us to be close again.

"My wife and I have been married 13 years. We've had our ups and downs, but for the past couple years your relationship has been in a really good place. We both feel comfortable expressing our opinions to each other without it blowing up into a full on argument.

In the last couple years, my wife has been slowly losing weight. Between a dietary restriction, a more active job, and old fashioned portion control, she has lost about 80 lbs in the last 2 years or so. This has caused her wedding ring to be very loose on her finger, to the point it can slip off very easily. I got her some plastic inserts that are supposed to help tighten the band, she said it made it too tight and hurt her hand. I've suggested wearing it on a chain around her neck, but she said she would feel naked without it on her finger

Just now, as I was dropping her off from work, she noticed her ring was gone while applying some lotion. She immediately started freaking out. I had her check the area where we parked when I left and said I would check around her seat and retrace our steps when I got back home. Luckily the ring was on the bathroom floor, and I sent her a picture letting her know it's safe.

So, would I be an AH if I refused to give her the ring back unless she does something to keep from losing it again? It's not that I'm super attached to the ring itself, it's not an heirloom and wasn't expensive. I'm more concerned about how she would be if it were lost for real. I know she would be devastated if it were lost for good, but I don't know if that would justify keeping what is hers from her.",1
"My wife (34) and I (33) are having our second child. We have a daughter (5). 

She’s been grouchy her whole pregnancy so her sister offered to plan her a gender reveal party. 

The plan was that all the food and decorations would be blue or pink and in the end we’d get one of those special sparklers that would light 
up in either blue or pink to reveal the gender. 

We went to the doctor and got her to write the result in a folded piece of paper that we passed over to her sister without looking.

So flash forward to the day of the party and the moment of truth comes and the sparkler turns out to be pink for a girl.

I don’t know what came over me but all I felt at that moment was very bitter disappointment. To be honest, all I was hoping for for baby #2 is to be able to toss a ball around with him and coach little league. Or watch him go on Boy Scouts camping trips. 

I know my daughter is only five, but I’ve already started to deal with the dramas of being a father of a girl and the thought of having to double up now on the neuroticism was harrowing.

I grew up in a house with three older boys and one younger sister and I can’t imagine seeing myself be outnumbered.

My wife grabbed my arm as people were approaching us to say their congratulations and said I needed to look happier. At that moment I just snapped. I shook my head and walked out to my car ( we came separately) and drove to my sister’s (21F) house.

I start getting texts from my sister in law and my wife saying “ way to reenact” their dad leaving their mom when they were 10 and 12. 

I felt like that accusation was unfair and that I just needed some time alone. I didn’t ask to be flabbergasted- it just happened. And I don’t think it’s fair that they would have demanded I smile and nod for the next couple of hours.

"Not a huge deal but I’m curious.

I have two cousins, Max and Nate. They’re both 18 but are complete opposites. They have different parents, and are cousins as well. Anyways, Max is more outgoing and ignorant while Nate is more reserved and careful. Nate has a more diverse friend group while Max is friends with certain people only.

Our grandma hosted a party a week ago and my mom mentioned one of my cousins getting a girlfriend and how she was going to be at the party. 

We got there and I’m looking for my cousins and they’re all standing together except Nate and Max. They’re all having a conversation about how nice “Nina” is. When I asked who Nina is, one cousin jokingly said “the new girl.” They did not say “Max’s gf” or “Nate’s gf”. They then point her out to me and she was talking to Nate’s mom. She also looks nothing like any of Max’s exes (in the most inoffensive way, he had a type). 

Time goes on and we don’t really talk about the 3. Max doesn’t like hanging out with us so him not being around makes sense, and I figured Nina and Nate were together. 

Max approaches us a while later and asked if I’ve seen Nina. I jokingly tell him she’s probably with Nate and that we should let them be. He gets annoyed and asks me why the hell she’d be with Nate. I just say “well… probably because they’re dating? What’s it to you?” He then gets mad and says Nina’s his girlfriend. I felt a little embarrassed but apologized. He then asks me why on earth I’d assume otherwise. I couldn’t really think of anything but “you guys don’t really match” at the time and he got mad and said “oh but her and Nate do? Fuck you.” He them stormed off. 

The other cousins that saw the whole thing thought it was funny and think Max is just throwing a tantrum but they did say that I made it sound as if Nina dating Max is the most unbelievable thing ever. But they also said they agree. Nate couldn’t stop laughing when he found out and said he wished he could’ve seen the look on Max’s face but that just makes me feel like an asshole ngl. Nate and Max pretty much hate each other and I’m probably the only person who’s been neutral about their fighting. Max was giving me evil looks the rest of the night and every time I tried to talk to him he told me that I should talk to Nate instead. He’s even unfollowed me on social media. 

I do think he’s being a bit childish as I apologized and it was an honest mistake but I can also see how I seemed a little mean especially since it’s regarding Nate and his own girlfriend. AITA?",1

For example, if my kid picks out the 120 count crayons, we might redirect him to the 96 count instead since that's easier to carry around in his backpack. Other than practicality, we don't try to persuade them in any way. It's always a fun experience and a great way to kick off the school year (and to relieve some of those ""oh god my baby is leaving me"" fears for my husband and I with our 5yo.) We usually grab quite a few of the items on the teacher's wish list as well and make a point to wrap it up nicely as a little thank you present from our children to the educator that will be spending the year with them.

This year upon receiving the school supplies list, there is a note made at the top that all supplies should be exactly as listed on the sheet (such as, a 24 pack of crayons) as all items will be shared with every student in the class. This was confusing for me, as I buy the items specifically for my children.

I decided I was going to go through with our supply shopping tradition as normal - never getting anything LESS than what was required, of course - and send a note with both of my boys that their items would be their own and could be kept in their backpacks as usual. When I expressed this sentiment to those around me (aside from my husband, who was on my side) they weren't very receptive to the idea.

AITA for not following the rules listed?

**EDIT:** I am 100% open (and now intend to) buy extra school supplies to send with each of my children for those whose families can't afford to purchase them. My kiddos also love to share and I'm sure they would love to pass around some colors from their boxes of crayons or let someone borrow their scissors when the time came. We also respect teachers and don't expect them to provide supplies for every student! Just wanted to clear these things up.",1
"My wife went into labor around 6 pm on Sunday. We were expecting twins.

It quickly turns into a very painful process she kept cutting off the blood pressure to my hand when she squeezed and nearly sprayed my shirt with vomit.

Around 3 am my dad calls. I work for my dad’s company and we had a presentation for clients Monday morning that I had to get ready for.

My dad heard my wife was in labor but told me he needed me on this presentation. He said there was nothing I could do to help my wife and delivery and seeing the baby come out was overrated and people don’t prepare your for the gore.

He said he needed me to rest up and make myself presentable for the presentation.

My wife’s labor was progressing very slowly and we were all certain she would need forceps or other assistance to deliver the babies. 

I realized that I couldn’t help her here, and my dad was counting on me, so I told her I needed to leave.

She started screaming at me so loudly that a few nurses rushed over to our room.

I ended up doing the presentation with the clients and things went well.

I leave the office and see a text on my phone that said my wife delivered an hour ago at around 10:30 am and they had to use forceps. 

I would have missed the meeting had I stayed and my dad has given me everything he could possibly give me in life, so I didn’t want to let him down. 

AITA? I had responsibilities I had to take care of and while my wife is still screaming at me saying that she was alone when they “ destroyed her body”, I’m the only one who works and her mom herself said that she was emotional and overreacting. 

My wife even went as far to say that her family would disown her if she was the first of them to divorce but that she doesn’t consider me her husband right now.",1
"I'm childfree and always have been. When I met my wife, she was thrilled that I didn't have kids and was sterilized.

Unfortunately, I had a situation before the big v and meeting my wife where I may have fathered a biological daughter, who we'll call Emma, but it's a complicated situation. For a start, Emma's mother is not sure who the father actually is, but with how timelines are, the biological father is either me or one another candidate. Secondly, there is no way to establish paternity due to the international situation. Emma's mother moved to New Zealand before she knew she was pregnant because she got a very good opportunity and had a quicker path to citizenship than most. By the time Emma was born, she had NZ citizenship and had decided to renounce her US citizenship for personal reasons.

We did try to sort it out, but even without the unique problems presented by the global situation, trying to do anything legal internationally with those complications is difficult at best. Ultimately, it wasn't possible to even establish paternity, let alone do anything else if everyone wanted that. We all decided that we should stay as family friends and leave the door open for contact and testing in the future.

My mom talks more to Emma's mother than I do and thinks highly of Emma, but it's not like a grandma relationship and she knows the truth, although she frequently nags me about it and doesn't agree that letting it go was the right decision. We just started doing family dinners again, and my mom decided to pick that fight again in front of my wife. Now my wife is mad at me for ""hiding a child"" from her. I didn't. I don't legally have any children, and there is only a 50% chance that Emma is my biological child. Emma's mother is raising her with an entire family and probably a partner by now. It's basically a donation situation where I may not even BE the donor. AITA?

Edit: YES, I'm aware that 23 and me exists, but doesn't help. The reason that something being legally admissible matters so much is that we would need something that Emma's mother couldn't just unilaterally refuse. Emma's mother could just text ""No✌"" to 23 and me if she didn't want to do it and that would be that.",1
"I (22NB) was supposed to move in with my two friends Joanne (21NB) and Benny (22F). Joanne was living in Florida at the time, and was going to have to move up to Mass for this to happen. We start sending apartment listing within budget, and even start a pinterest board. 
So, Joanne moves up on November 1st. We, and two other friends, Mark (23) and Collin (21), go to a diner on the 2nd. While there, Joanne relays to me, “Benny just told me that she applied for student housing.”
Joanne and I just kind of blink at each other and try to keep the conversation going.

That night, Benny texts Joanne a really long text about how they’re sorry. Joanne asks when Benny applied for student housing, to which Benny says they havent actually applied. Joanne leaves Benny on read. 
I receive a text asking if Joanne is mad at Benny. I responded the next day, saying “I can’t speak for Joanne.” Benny then texts back immediately that Joanne has left them on read, but they get it, we’re mad. I respond that yes, I am mad. But I tell her that I am upset about how she told us, and that I am okay with her not moving in with us. 

I get in response, that she is being iced out by Joanne and what else were they supposed to do? That she’s been crying over this since the dinner because she felt bad. 

To which I respond, because I do not want to yell at her, that I don’t have any answers she is going to want at that point in time. And that while I understand she wants to resolve this as fast as possible, that I need time to cool off before even thinking of moving past this. 

Benny responds at 1:45am that “You’re not even trying to see this from my perspective. You two aren’t the only ones fucked up over this.” and I do not respond to this message. 

At 1:46am the same night, Joanne recieves a reply to her message saying she needs space to cool down before talking that says, “That’s okay. Take all the time you need.”

(It’s at this time that I also see that Benny was on an arcade date with her new boyfriend when she texted those messages.)

Two weeks later, I am finally almost not mad about this. Only to recieve a discord notification while at work. Benny has messaged the DnD discord that she is moving into student housing for the spring semester. She then pings Joanne and I specifically saying “Sorry I can’t move in with you guys.” 

Joanne responds with a “Good luck”, and Mark responds with a good luck as well. 

Fast forward to Thanksgiving, where I end my night at Joanne’s house to steal some leftovers. While eating (it was delicious), I check Instagram and happen to look at the “People You May Know” section where Benny’s instagram shows up. I have not unfollowed her, so I know she’s removed me. Joanne thinks that it happened because the two of us did a cosplay photoshoot without Benny, but I think it may be because of the not responding right away.

So… AITA for not responding for three weeks while trying to cool off? Should I even bother to message her at all?",1
"My wife (26f) and I (26m) both work 4 days a week, I work 12hr shifts and she works 8hr shifts. She would work more, but our daughter (1f) needs to be picked up from daycare. I leave for work before they wake up and some days get home after our daughter has gone to bed.

This week, our daughter's daycare provider was sick, so my wife took the week off of work to care for her. I worked an extra day to make up for her lost income, so it all worked out fine (or so I thought)

She seemed stressed still, so I asked her what was wrong. She broke down, saying that she is struggling with balancing work, caring for our daughter throughout the week, and keeping our house clean/cooking/etc. I responded calmly by saying that I can't miss work or reduce hours. We simply cannot afford it.

She responded by saying she knows that, but it is overwhelming for her, and the house chores are piling up.  I told her 90% of the problems with messiness could be solved if she picked up after herself. If she just put the used butter knifes in the sink after she was done, and rinsed bottles/cookware/etc. I will happily do the dishes when I get home from work. Hell, I'll even put them away after. But I do not want to play scavenger hunt and look around the house for things to wash.

She did not respond to me after I said that other than a quiet okay before going to console our daughter who woke up early from her nap. She still seemed upset with me still, so I vented to my coworker about what happened. He says I was being an asshole because I didn't even listen to what she wanted. I feel like I was perfectly reasonable. Am I the asshole?",1
"Ok so this is kind of a weird situation. My wife is one of those super prim and proper chicks. Like shes the walking definition of an 80s housewife. You don't ever catch her doing anything ""impolite"", whether its burping or farting or shitting or any basic body function. Even weirder, when asked about it she completely denies she does any of these things. I've never managed to catch her, up until she had our daughter. 

She had an emergency c section, and had a rough time recovering from it. She wasn't able to get up and walk by herself so I had to help her to the toilet and since shes so weird about ""needing privacy to pee"", I'd just go to the other room and she'd call me when she was done. 

Well she had been in there for a while, and I'm like oh she totally has to be shitting. So I went in there and sure enough she was. I teased her and was like, ""See! I knew you shit too!"" She got real embarrassed and told me to shut up and leave her alone and started to cry so I left to let her finish, but teased her about afterwards. She was real emotional so I shut up about it for a while. Well now some time has passed and shes no longer an emotional mess, so I figured I could finally tease her again.

Every once in a while I'll casually bring it up, like we'll be talking about something and I'll be like ""still it wasn't as bad as that time you shit. Man that was awful, i could smell it from in here!"" She always gets mad and yells at me to shut up, which is hilarious. Well she broke down the other day and started yelling and sobbing when I brought it up saying that was a difficult time for her and shes still embarrased about it and she hates me making fun of her for it. I told her it's just funny because it's the only time I got to catch her doing it, and its harmless teasing and it's no big deal. But I kind of feel bad because she was really crying about it, and my friend said I was a jerk for making fun of something that happened right after giving birth. So AITA? I'm just trying to have fun and joke around with her.

Edit: Welp, I did not expect this to blow up like it did. I guess the general consensus is that I am TA, so I guess I'll try to tone it down for now until she has more time to calm down over it.",1
"Last night I sent a tiktok about radical Honesty to my bf. I mostly sent it because it was interesting and wasn't thinking much on it because I was sleepy. I asked how it can apply to us and I started to go off on a tangent explaining the video. During this tangent I confused him a bit with what I'm asking.

At one point we boiled it down to values and how we've already talked about our core values. And how I talk about it quite often. He brought up my original question and ultimately I was asking complete honesty. Even bringing things up that doesn't need to be brought up. Things that bring no value to us. 

I posed what if it's just something interesting. He then asked if I'm willing to get offended by the answer. That some things are left better unasked. The whole curiosity killed the cat.

I was wondering why should some questions be left unattended? Shouldn't curiosity be encouraged even if it brings no value? The person who went finding answers will have to deal with the answer no matter if they like it or not. He posed then that curiosity has a limit.

I kept pushing and pressing on with my views until he said we were getting no where. I did wamt it to end but I asked one last question and he stopped responding for 3 hours. I fell asleep within him not texting anymore. 

After waking up I realized maybe I was too hard on my stance. Maybe I stirred up unnecessary distress and frustration between us. I get that my stance is self sabotaging but is that so bad? 

Is it bad that I want to continue pressing on this issue?",1
"I have 2 daughters with 2 different women, 14F Jade and 15F Elle who are both in the same grade since Jade skipped a grade. Jade is very smart and extremely competitive while Elle is not much competitive. 

A while ago there was a test in their school. The test covered all of the subjects that they've learned this year and all of the kids in their grade had to take it. 

Yesterday they got the results. First Elle arrived and happily told me that she became 17th in their grade. I told her she did a really good job and I'm proud of her then Jade came and she was crying her eyes out and went to her room without saying anything. I thought something bad had happened but Elle told me that she was crying because she became 2nd in their grade. That night I decided to take her to her favorite restaurant to celebrate and cheer her up a bit so the 3 of us went to celebrate then I took the girls to their mom's homes. 

An hout later Elle's mom called me to tell me I'm an asshole for only celebrating Jade. I told her that it's not like we oredered a cake with Jade's name on it or didn't take Elle with us. It was just dinner with both of the girls and Jade was the one who was upset and did a better job so of course we would go to her favorite restaurant",1
"I (43m) have two kids (15f and 14m). Sophomore and Freshman. This school year, they've been making some really good grades (3.7+) and even juggling sports and/or clubs with that as well. I acknowledge that high school is difficult, between academics and social lives and athletics/hobbies.

&#x200B;

Over spring break (Apr 1-5) my wife and i were planning to go on a 5-7 trip with our kids to Vegas because, well, we don't have anything else to do. I told my kids about it, and they seemed pretty happy for a getaway and a break.

&#x200B;

On Saturday, my wife and I were looking at hotel bookings, and I brought up the idea of leaving on Good Friday (29th of March) and come back a week later on the fifth. I also added that they could probably stay home on Thursday just to relax as well. This is the part where my wife's face made the sound of a 1997 windows PC shutting down. She is very ""You go to school unless you're sick."" She's not a mental health day person. The idea of missing school thursday and friday (our potential bookings we're about 6:00 a.m.) was a huge no-no. 

&#x200B;

She just began to ask me why they needed to skip that day, with my reasoning being mostly a) kids need a break and b) these same kids have missed only one day so far and also C) they're good kids, why not reward them? Even after a lot of talking, she still won't budge.

&#x200B;

I've been thinking that maybe, I could have them take the one-day off anyways, but I'm asking here to see if I would be wrong before i do anything that could be seen as dum. AITA? Will provide extra needed info in comments. ",1
"Hello there, I’m currently typing this from my car, after my wife has told me she doesn’t want me near her right now. Hoping this thread will be a wake up call to her.

My wife (F33) is a big nerd, which I normally appreciate, but she is taking things way too far today. She took today off of work, so she could be up at 4AM to play her online game at launch. I didn’t wake up until about an hour ago (10:30, and she was still playing. I mentioned that I was
Hungry, hoping we could make breakfast together , which we like to do together. She instead said that I should “order us something from doordash, im in the middle of a dungeon and may be a while.” I didn’t really wanna get takeout, because we had already discussed ordering pizza tonight for dinner, and that’s a lot of take out food in one day. I calmly explained this, and she got pissed and shrieked at me that she just wanted one weekend to focus on her video game. I said that it was unfair to our family for her to isolate all weekend, and she got even more mad, telling me that I have two hands and can feed the goddamn cat. I was in tears at this point, and I did raise my voice and said that I was worried she’s obsessed with this game and maybe she needs professional help. She threw her car keys at me and said that I need to get out of her face, that she’s works all the time and doesn’t ask for much, and I need to leave her be and get out of her face for a few hours.

I am truly concerned that she has become obsessed with this online game, and I’m hoping that maybe reading this thread will wake her up to it, but I might’ve been the AH too.

Edit: some additional info I forgot: ir isn’t just today, for the last few weeks she’s been hyping herself up for this. When the game got delayed, she MOVED HER VACATION time rather than just keep her previous day off and spend it with me. She’s been absolutely freaking out about this game and I don’t understand it and it scares me.",1
"I a 19M had had a lab in a physic course a few weeks ago.  Basically the lab was simple. We rolled a ball down a slope to try and hit a bull’s eye on the floor. The ball in question was small but still metallic and magnetic. I kept rolling the ball down the slope and saw my parter’s head (Let’s call them Sam) was viewing downward. I assumed they was looking at the ruler adjacent to the paper bull’s eye. 

Eventually we swapped roles and it was my turn to observe since we weren’t getting clear results. Turns out when I went over there, I noticed the paper bull’s eye was not taped down to the tile floors. This immediately caused me to panic as I heard the ball rolling towards me and I made a comment my teacher overheard regarding the situation with prompted her to take me out of the situation. 

At this point, I knew that my lab was completely fucked because I let some idiot lead me on thinking they knew what they were doing and it wasn’t the type of lab where you could just work on your own. Eventually I finished the lab thanks to borrowing another group’s notes, but the damage had been done. 

When it came time for me to pack up Sam tried apologizing and told me “I didn’t see the tape there.” I called bullshit and told them that we’re roughly the same height and that even I saw the tape and that I didn’t want to hear any excuses from him. 

The next lecture, Sam tried to give me the same excuse, but it’s was such a bad lie that I told them that I didn’t want to hear it and just tried to dismiss him as politely as possible for as angry as I was at them for his incompetence.

To the day, I still have resentment towards their utter negligence of basic lab safety. So am I the asshole?",1
"My youngest son ""Ian"" (15M) and his boyfriend ""Keith"" (16M) snuck out to a party Saturday night and apparently got pretty wasted. They somehow managed to get to my oldest son's ""Joseph's"" (20M) apt sometime around 4 am.

  Instead  of calling me or having  Keith call his parents he instead let them sleep it off at his house.  And I didn't get a call till sometime around 10 that morning from Joseph's girlfriend to come pick them up. I was furious.. After picking up the boys , giving them a good talking to , and dropping Keith off at his parent's. I  called Joseph and asked why he didn't call me or Keith's parents the moment they showed up or took them home himself. He tells me that it was better they slept it off there  and he had to go to work 7 in the morning. 


I screamed at him that wasn't his decision  and I had been worried sick waking up in the morning and not knowing where Ian was. That he shoulda called  me their father. Joseph' tried to get me to calm down and told me that this what he was trying to avoid me blowing up at Ian. This got me hot I yelled at him that I didn't give a damn what he was trying to avoid  that I'm the dad and that he should have called me because anything could have happened..  He tried to apologize and I just told him I'd talk to him later.  Ian ran up to his room after we got home  but not before saying  that Joseph' was just trying to protect him and that I went way overboard on him calling him at work like that. AITA?",1
"Edit 2 (UPDATE): Well I have the update you all have been waiting for. I decided to go out with some friends last night to blow off some steam (yeah, dumb, I know) and managed to stay out until 5 or 6 am. I honestly didn’t mean to. I tend to not check my phone much when I’m out and when I finally checked it I had a ton of missed calls and texts from my girlfriend asking where I was or if I was okay. I was fine, my friends just wanted to hang out longer than I expected. 

When I got home she was angry that she had to stay up all night worrying about me getting home safely (I didn’t ask her to stay up for me). She sat me down and said that she will not be renewing our lease when it’s up and that it’s up to me to decide how I’ll be going forward until then. She said it’s not the drinking that’s the issue but the fact that it feels like she has to “parent” me after the fact and can’t relax while I’m drinking, even when it’s with friends. 

So yeah. Now I’m spending my Friday apartment hunting and looking for a therapist. 
_________________________________________________

My (29M) girlfriend (25F) have been together for a little over 5 years. She’s rather introverted and doesn’t drink or enjoy going out. She’d rather stay in and watch a movie or go to a nice dinner. I don’t mind doing this sometimes, but sometimes I feel like it would be nice to have some drinks with my girlfriend. It feels like all she does is go to work, work on her dissertation, go to the gym, and sleep. 

The other night I convinced her to go out to some bars. After a while she agreed but said she was tired from work and school, so she only wanted to go out for a little while. I was fine with this, but the entire time we were out she was entirely sober, acting pissed off and it was honestly not fun to be around. I got annoyed and told her her energy was bad and she said it was just because she was tired but she was enjoying the music (it didn’t look like it at all). We left after a couple of hours, normally when I’m with friends I like to stay out until 2-3am. 

The next morning I brought up how she was acting and suggested the next time we go out  that she has just one drink to loosen up a bit and maybe it’ll be more fun for her. I also said that I feel weird being the only one getting drunk and that it sucks drinkng alone. She disagreed and got mad at me saying that I need grow up and that drinking and partying aren’t everything. I’ll admit that I’ve gone overboard going out with friends in the past and it’s led to arguments that I regrettably don’t remember, but I’ve been depressed and going out is one thing that makes me feel better. 

I jokingly asked her when she got so boring and she snapped at me saying that she would rather save up for a nice vacation or go to a music festival/concerts or a nice, expensive dinner. These things are out of my budget and a vacation is only a once or twice a year thing anyway. And, when we do go on vacation she’d rather do boring touristy stuff like go to museums or sight see. I told her that I don’t think I can give her the life she wants and is used to (she had a very wealthy upbringing) and she called me an asshole and has been acting cold ever since.  So, AITA?

TLDR: my girlfriend doesn’t like going out or drinking. I jokingly called her boring and now she is mad at me.

Edit: I didn’t expect for this to take off so fast. I just wanted to add some info clarifying some things. We do have quite a bit in common overall - we met at a music festival and share a love for music. When we first started dating when she was still in undergrad we would go to concerts frequently and had a lot of fun. We have the same goofy sense of humor, we both like fitness and video games. We both like the travel, but like I said I can’t afford it right now. She is used to going on luxurious vacations abroad with her family that cost $10-30k and I can’t offer the same. 

I do love and care about her, which is why I want to go out with HER. Only going out with friends all the time is not the same. I originally liked how opposite we were because I felt like she brought balance to my life that I needed, but as I’m nearing 30 I regret not doing more in my 20’s and I’m scared of wasting time not having fun. 

I admit that my word choice was stupid and while I was joking, it wasn’t perceived that way.",1
"Throwaway account. 

My 95 y/o grandma just passed away last week, and we have her wake today and her funeral tomorrow. I currently live with 3 female roommates, and consider them my closet friends. I’ve known all my roommates for about 2 years. I get along with everyone pretty well except for my one roommate who we will call Kay. Kay is my age, black, and I’ve known her probably for the longest. She and I used to work at a retail store before living together but weren’t very close. 

K recently has been keeping to herself. She pays rent on time but is usually never home and spends most of her time with her bf. This bothers me a bit because I miss her, but I understand because her and her bf have been together for 4 years. 

My grandma died last week Monday and when I texted everyone in our groupchat they were all very kind and expressed their condolences but K took forever to respond, which peeved me a bit. That same day while we were at dinner I asked K if she could come to the funeral on Tuesday next week and she looked angry but said she would let me know later. 

After dinner she texted me saying she couldn’t come to the funeral because it was during her work hours. She explained that since she is an intern she can’t take off randomly because she wants to impress them and receive a full time offer. She also said she felt uncomfortable going because she didn’t  know my grandma at all and felt it was disrespectful to go. She said she would come to the wake since it was after work but I told her not to bother and haven’t spoken to her since. 

My therapist said I should apologize to her but I disagree. My other roommates are going to the funeral & have only met my grandma once. 

TL;DR: Roommate won’t go to my grandma’s funeral because it’s during her work hours and since she didn’t  know my grandma at all.


UPDATE: I apologize for my late response , I was at the wake all day yesterday. I see your responses and understand that I have overreacted with Kay. I mentioned Kay’s race because I figured that would be a potential factor for her distancing herself from me and our other roommates. We are all white except for her, and I thought she may sometimes feel different being the minority in the house. I am not a racist, and I think you are all being a bit dramatic about that, I would never be racist to Kay, and we have all made her feel very welcome in the house. 

Anyways, Kay actually showed up to the wake for a few minutes, and I apologized to her for my behavior, but told her I did want to discuss her reasons for pulling away from us in the house. 

She explained that she felt I was too needy and emotionally dependent on other people and it was tiring because she already has a lot to deal with. I recently was dumped by my bf of 2 years so I admit I have been crying a lot and asking for support from my roommates/sister. Kay also said she didn’t like how I reacted to my FWB, who I also invited to the wake but he also declined. 

I apologized for my behavior and she left shortly y after that. I realize I need to listen to my therapist and work on my self, which I will try to do moving forward. Kay will not be attending the funeral, and I told my other roommates they didn’t have to come either, to take the pressure off. I have my sister and mom here to lean on for support.",1
"

My wife and I are expecting our first baby together, We made an appointment to find out the gender of the baby. To me, this is very important (I had hopes for a boy) unfortunately, the day of the dr appointment I had to attend my friend's birthday that I remembered last minute. I asked my wife if we could cancel the appointment and go another day but she looked shocked that I even considered canceling the appointment and going to my friend's birthday, I said I had no choice. She said canceling the dr appointment was off the table because these appointments are restricted to specific time and date and we can't miss it so she'll go alone. I told her no because that'd be selfish of her and besides this will ruin the news of finding out if the baby is a boy or a girl. She cut the discussion and told me to go to the birthday party. I did then later found out she didn't cancel the dr appointment and went with her mom. I came home seething and blew up at her. I started arguing with her about going behind my back and doing this without me. She said it wasn't her fault I prioritized a party over my child. I told her I didn't prioritize anything; she literally could've canceled and we would've went another day but clearly, she was trying to steer the fight to a direction where I look like the neglectful and irresponsible one. We fought some then she said I'm probably angry with her because it's a girl but I responded that she was wrong. She went outside the room claiming I was ""stressing her out"". now acts like I owe her an apology on top of everything else but I feel upset and like I was decieved by her.


AITA?


INFO: first off ??? Jesus, I swear I came here thinking I was somewhat justified in my frustration but I was wrong it seems. Although I just wanna point out that I did not just go to the party without telling my wife and having a discussion with her first. Also the friend lives 2 hours away so I had to leave at 2 and the appoitment was at 4. I did not know she went and I would've appreciated it if she at least was upfront with me about what she did. She could've said she was going anyway but instead told me to go to the party and had me thinking she was going to cancel and reschedule.

My son (33M) got “Erica” pregnant, who we knew as a daughter of a friend and she decided she didn’t want the baby, my son didn’t want the baby either…we offered to financially help Erica out, if we were able to adopt the baby as we’d always wanted another child but it never happened for us.

We paid her rent for 2 years whilst she went to college.

Cut to 11 years later.


We unfortunately have a poor relationship with our son, as he doesn’t want to be involved with our daughter but we see him and text him frequently enough, he visited us and told us Erica had asked to see our daughter - my husband had told her when she was pregnant that we MAY allow contact, but honestly we don’t think that’s best for our daughter at this stage

It’ll be confusing and upsetting, I told her when our daughter is emotionally well enough we’ll tell her, but right now she’s going through therapy for anxiety.

My son thinks I’m TA, Erica has a 2 year old now and said she “couldn’t even imagine” how our daughter will feel when she does find out that Erica has a family, my son and Erica both believe I’m TA, but not only that Ericas parents that I’ve known for over 25 years are now refusing contact and insulting us to common friends saying they “allowed” the adoption, but Erica has a right to know her daughter.

Nobody had a problem 3 years ago when we went through this, Erica contacted us then and we shot her down telling her that  we weren’t comfortable until our daughter was an adult, but now suddenly everyone is losing their mind.

"My wife mentioned today that she wanted a Mother's Day present this year, even though our baby isn't due for almost a month later. I told her that I was absolutely not going to get her a Mother's Day present until next year, when we actually have a baby.


Now I am getting all kinds of flak from my wife, and she's declared that if I don't get her a Mother's Day present this year then she won't get me a Father's Day present until next year. 


I think it's absurd to *expect* a present for a holiday that you don't qualify for. Where do you draw the line?! Would you expect a Mother's Day gift if you were in a childless relationship but had pets? If people want to unexpectedly gift others for holidays they don't technically fit in that's fine, but to expect it seems unreasonable.

WIBTA if I refused to get her a gift this year? At this point it's just the principal of it.


Edit: Some of you are out here wilding. We have a long and happy marriage. We've been together almost half the time she's been alive.

Since so many keep asking. We are very similar in age.

Edit 2: So I *may* have been wrong not to get her a Mother's Day gift. She wants a super expensive hair dryer, but I found one on Alibaba that looks similar for like $20 so maybe I'll grab her that.

Edit 3: I've shown my wife this post. She's been crying laughing at you all roasting me. That being said, some of you all are unhinged. I'll probably get her the nice hairdryer, but I might also get the cheap one to give to her first. 
I'll accept in this instance I am TA.",1
"So someone new came into the office today. A couple of people asked me to go meet her. She was standing with a couple of other people when I walked up to them. I introduced myself and asked for her name. She said her name was Maria. So I then said, in the friendliest way possible, ""Maria. Say it loud and there's music playing. Say it soft and it's almost like praying."" I thought I would get a few laughs from it, but all I got were some uncomfortable sounding chuckles. I guess the reference was too dated for them. Maria was just standing there with a weak smile. I wasn't sure if she was uncomfortable or not. But anyway, we all just moved on and I figured it was just a joke that fell flat.

Later in the day, another coworker came to me and said I was being weird when I made that joke, and I was lucky I didn't get reported to HR. Some people may have gotten the idea that I was trying to flirt with her, but all I really wanted to do was break the ice with a stupid little reference. But now I'm wondering if I might have said something I shouldn't have. AITA?

Edit: Okay, I've seen enough. Mostly people saying I'm the asshole, with some saying I'm not. But either way, I'll have to be more careful before I say something that could be offensive.

Oh, and to that Aussie guy, please take a flying leap. That is all.",1
"An opportunity has arisen for my wife to go to the beach for a week in October with her friend. She asked if I was ok with her going,  to which I originally responded (honestly) that I was not ok with it. 

We have a 3 year old and a 4 month old. Daycare opens at 6:30am, which is also when I need to be at work. So my wife usually drops them off,  and I'll pick them up after work since I get off earlier than she does. She works one full time job,  that has allowed her to work 2 days from home each week because of our infant, and then has weekends off. I work a full time job during the week,  and a part time job on the weekend. (So effectively I have no days off. )

My wife gets up in the mornings and gets the kids ready,  and usually gets up with the baby at night as well,  as she gets more days off/ at home. Were she to take vacation,  this would of course all fall on me. I could probably manage to be late to work all week without issue,  as long as I stayed later to make up for it. 

I told her I was uncomfortable with her leaving for so long. I understand needing a break from the kids,  but there's a difference between me watching them for a day so she can relax and her straight up taking a whole spring break. Not to mention,  she also has a 3 day work trip at the end of this month that will put us in the same scenario. It's a lot for one person, and originally,  I did not want children. Granted,  I love them more than anything now,  but ultimately,  I feel like this is the life she chose for herself and she knew what she was getting herself into. I don't want to deny her the opportunity per se, but I don't know of many mothers who leave for that long by themselves with such a young one at home, and I feel like she's being a little entitled. 

She responded that she's not being entitled because she's just asking me to do what she does every day. She feels like I'm telling her that she can be a mother and nothing else. I don't think this is true,  I think I'm just asking her to be a mother FIRST. I know she does a lot as a mother,  and I appreciate it greatly,  but admittedly I do not feel like I'm capable of doing what she does every day.  I do not get the days off/ home that she does,  and I honestly don't have the patience I should with the infant.

After much back and forth,  I begrudgingly told her that she could go and that I would just figure it out, and if I absolutely had to,  I would take PTO from work to make sure the kids are taken care of. She said not to worry about it,  she just won't go. I don't want her to be bitter about it,  because I completely understand needing a vacation,  especially from kids/ family, and have offered alternatives,  like watching them for a weekend so she can do as she pleases,  to which she was not very receptive.  Am I the asshole ?

Edit: people seem to be hung up on the ""this is the life she chose for herself"" part.  I do not say this to say that she deserves more of the burden of parenting. A lot of assumptions suggest that I do not parent while she slaves away.  I feed and bathe and father my kids as well. It is a team effort, but taking over her share while working 60 hours a week is overwhelming af. When i say she chose this for herself, I mean that getting things her way on her own time becomes much less reasonable, and i feel like she refuses to accept this,  or is largely unwilling to compromise when it comes to giving up things she wants.

Another Edit: I have no problem being a father.  That's not the issue.  In fact, last year before I switched to my current jobs,  there was a good 8 to 10 months where I worked at night,  and kept our toddler during the day to save on daycare costs. It was great.  Who doesn't want to watch Bluey all day?  I CAN do what she does every day.  I CANNOT do what she does AND what I do everyday.",1
"Last week, I was using my sister Ashley’s phone because mine was dead and I needed to call a friend to confirm plans. Dialing my friend’s number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she’s on tinder (she’s 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said “none of your business” 

I decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she’s just swiping for fun?) so I didn’t want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he’d mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. 

I created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister’s account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she’s still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me. 

I decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could “head to my place afterwards”. She was completely receptive and said she’d meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. 

After she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for “Jim”. My dad went up to her and said “Jim’s not coming” and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. My dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the Internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger’s* place. We were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. 

I told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said I was a “fucking dick” and “cruel” to her. My other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. Wondering who’s right and if I went too far?

EDIT: Yes, when I asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would’ve had sex with Jim. That’s why I went the extent that I did.

Alright after reading all these judgments, I came to the conclusion that I’m TA. But I’m TA she needed. If anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder. 

And to the people who said she’ll never speak to me again, we just finished playing fifa for the last hour so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯",1
"My mom is getting remarried (my birth father passed away a while ago). A few weeks ago I won Taylor Swift tickets on the radio for the same day as her wedding. I made the decision to go to the concert over the wedding, and I told her this, and she is very upset- she has not spoken to me since. I love my mother and feel bad missing her wedding, but I thought she would understand due to the circumstances. I do not like my soon-to-be stepfather, and I feel like seeing Taylor Swift is a once in a lifetime experience that I do not want to miss. 

Also- I have made it very clear to my mom over the past few months that I am not okay with the marriage, but still plan to be at the wedding. But then I won the tickets, and things changed. 

So, AITA for choosing the concert over the wedding?",1
"  

So, this is a messed-up situation and outlandish. 

When I (38M) was 23 had a relationship with my friend’s (40M) wife (39F) (not proud of that, I s\*cked) she got pregnant of twins, I believed those kids were mine since my friend had fertility issues so once the babies were born I sued her for a paternity test I had to show evidence on our affair to prove why this request wasn’t out of the question and there was a high possibility I could be the father, the court accepted and they were 100% my children but the judge grant me no rights or responsibilities over my kids (I attempted to pay child support but they refused) because they were conceived in a marital union and my friend was willing to acknowledge them, so I had no business being in their lives and any relationship would be up to their parent’s discretion, according to the judge for the kids “well-being”.

I remember going to their house to beg them to let me see the twins but only let me once, I loved them from that moment and wanted to be in their lives but they just refused and threatened to file charges against me, so I moved on. 

This was really traumatic to me, I loved those boys and wanted to be there for them, I remember crying because I couldn’t be part of their lives, I even wrote a journal called “Another day without my boys”, but things got better, I moved to another city, I met my wife and now we have a wonderful son (8)

Last month my ex-friend contacted me because he wanted to know where I live, since my sons want to know me, apparently, my sons (15) started asking, they had doubts because they look nothing like their father or any relative and after insisting so much, their parents ended up confessing what happened or at least half of it, I declined because getting over it was maybe the hardest thing I ever had to do and I don’t think I can do it again, So I sent them the journal I wrote about them and a letter stating that if once they turn 18 they still want to meet me I’ll be here for them with my open arms but now I can’t. after I sent the journal my boys keep texting me every time requesting to meet and it's hard not to be able to, so I called their parents and demanded that the kids stop texting me and they (my ex-friend and his wife) should never call me again unless my kids need an organ transplant, they called me a j\*rk for such a “childish attitude” and demanding a “painful thing for my kids” so Am I wrong here? Just need unbiased points of view since almost everyone calls me TA.",1
"I (15F) loved skincare basically for the past 2 years, so one time my best friends sister (14F) we will call her Alex. Alex had an acne problem going on with her face and hated how it looks on her and she felt insecure so I decided to help her out with the situation going on, and when I gave her the list of stuff to buy she was pleased with the outcome and honestly her and her sister called me their mom friend because of how much I’ve helped them out to the point they think of me as a mother figure.

One day she finally got a new friend she stuck to and let’s call her Lisa. Lisa had an even worse acne problem but it was none of my concern or business as she wasn’t my friend but just a stranger, one day Lisa sees that Alexa’s acne faded and had left no scars so she asked her for tips and said I told her not to tell a soul, so Lisa comes to me for approval and I deny it, Lisa then attacks me (verbally) for not telling her regular girl stuff because apparently this is something to tell others about, so I tell her that if she wanted tips she can go to a dermatologist because am not doing charity work and Lisa gets even angrier and starts talking shit about me to my own friends 💀💀 

Did I overdo it by refusing to tell her tips??

UPDATE : holy shit you guys are actually thinking am whispering demonic things into a 14 year olds brain?? Good morning am just saying I feel like I shouldn’t tell people something I worked hard to understand and felt the need to not share it to the whole planet, and how is it my fault especially when someone starts gossiping when all you did was tell them no, i legit thought adults taught us to tell people no when not comfortable 😐 

2nd update : I’ll list her the stuff she needs to use sorry",1
"Y’all, I used to be 430 lbs and over the last 6 months I’ve lost nearly 160 lbs. I’m the smallest I’ve EVER been my adult life and I am LOVING it. 

My husband and I have been married 7 years and he has been super duper supportive and loving and encouraging, but he is also on the husky side and the man looooooves his fast food every week or so. 

I have been craving McDonald’s, kfc, all that gorgeous greasy fatty goodness and because my diet is doing so well I put a blanket ban on all fast food in the house. 

At first my man was 100% for it and told me whatever made my life easy but for the last month or so he’s been wanting to get fast food and I’ve told him he’s welcome to go eat out or in the car but it’s not coming in the house. He’s been getting frustrated with me and said it’s his house too and he should be allowed to eat KFC without me telling him ‘no’. In fairness to him he’s respected the rule and I know for a fact he’s not snuck it in the house. 

I love him and really do feel bad but my friends are really encouraging and keep telling me he needs to deal with it. Am I really a monster? Should I just relent and let him get the occasional fast food?

EDIT: Guys I’m deeply humbled by your responses. Platinum?! Silver!?? I don’t deserve that. There so many more interesting AITA posts on here but I have cried tears of happiness over how amazing each of y’all on here are!! THANK YOU. I am grateful.",1
"
My (21F) sister isn’t accepted by my (29M) parents for being gay.

Throw away account so my family cant link this back to me. 

*For some context: My little sister is a lesbian. Our family does not support her decisions, but I don’t give a f*ck who she sleeps with. When she came out she was distanced from the family, but we started talking again after finding out our father is dying.*

After things in the family being rocky for a long time we decided to all get together at my parents house. My dad said he wanted to put all of the drama and bickering aside, and if we have a problem with each other we can wait until he passes. Everyone agrees, including my sister, so I was expecting to have a nice family BBQ. My family wanted to meet my sister’s girlfriend, and insisted that she brought her over. We were all excited to meet her. 

 My sister’s girlfriend seemed like a nice girl, but she was very stand off-ish. She kept to herself, and didn’t speak much to my parents and me. For the most part she was glued to my sister. This caused some awkward silence. I started asking about their relationship. How did they meet, how long have they been together, and I even joked around about if she hurt my sister *blah blah blah.* My parents started acting stranger by each question. I asked my mom what was wrong, and her response was:

“This isn’t right.” 

I could tell my sister and her girlfriend were uncomfortable, and my dad tried to calm my mom down. My sister, probably fed up with being treated like sh*t for the last few years, spoke up and asked my parents what was the point of inviting them if she wasn’t going to be okay with seeing them together. 

This caused my mother to explode with anger because she felt like my sister was being disrespectful. My mother goes onto say a lot of other things (that I’m not going to say because I will be banned 😅). My sister started to cry and hyperventilate. Her girlfriend starts to comfort her and tries to get her to calm down, and this causes my mom to tell her that “if you’re going to be dramatic and act like a child, you need to leave. You’re upsetting your father.” Before my sister could respond her girlfriend is grabbing their things and taking my sister to the car. 

I tried to rationalize this whole situation with my parents, they were no use. They thought she was putting on a show in front of her girlfriend to make them look bad. They proceeded to say that they’re allowed to be uncomfortable, and feel differently than her. I explained to them that this is who she loves. No one has to agree with it, but we should still love her. I’ve tried talking to my sister about the whole situation, and apparently I *defend our parents too much.* I told her that our parents don’t *have* to agree with her relationship, but they should. She told me that I’m being an asshole for expecting her to pretend it’s be someone else just because our dad is dying. 

AITA?",1
"My boyfriend left home on his eighteenth birthday after a big fight with his dad. He tried to reach out after that, but his dad completely ignored him and wanted nothing to do with him. My boyfriend was really depressed about it, but he eventually got over it. I remember one night we all got drunk (we're apartment sharing with friends) and he told us that he was dead to his father, and that stuck with me.

Yesterday, he just showed up, my boyfriend's dad, that is. Myself and one of our roommates were the only people home. I answered the door, but I didn't let him in. He said he wanted to talk to his son and I said ""oh, your dead son?"" He must not have remembered or understood the reference, because he went completely pale and asked how/when he died. He looked almost as upset as my boyfriend had been, so I decided to let him stew in it.

I told him a fake story. He looked like he was going to throw up, and he asked if he could come in and have some water. I reluctantly let him, because he seemed very ill. Once inside, my roommate saw us and asked what was going on. My boyfriend's dad asked if he knew his son, and my roommate was super confused and it quickly came out that my boyfriend wasn't actually dead.

My boyfriend's dad was furious. He said I was a sick person with a hateful heart. I told him he said his son was dead to him, so why would he even care. He said he made a mistake in a moment of anger, but I made a cold-blooded decision. My roommate also said that what I did was fucked up.

I went to our room and called my boyfriend, who said to make sure his dad left before he came home, which I did, and he did, reluctantly. I didn't tell my boyfriend about the dead thing, just that he showed up and seemed to regret things. My boyfriend is shocked by his dad just showing up and I don't want to pile more on. My roommate said I was a huge asshole because ""no one deserves that,"" but I'm not sure. He did look so sick, but part of me thinks he brought it all upon himself. I don't know.

Edit: One of you made a compelling case to tell my boyfriend as soon as possible about telling his dad he was dead. He wanted to know what his dad's reaction was and kept asking if he said anything other than asking for more information before he found out it was a lie. He only really asked questions like ""When? How? Was it sudden?"" and such, and my boyfriend was pretty disappointed by that. He's pretty depressed this morning.",1
"I (41f) am a school Cafeteria worker. I work in a small rural  grade K-6 school. It would be generous to say we have 100 students. 

The principal wanted to offer a holiday meal for the students. I was notified we have 5 vegetarian kids, and 1 gluten free kid. I tried to be as inclusive as possible with the ingredients I have on hand to the student's food needs. I had turkey, potatos, peas, carrots, and vegan gluten free gravy. For dessert I had regular gingerbread cookies. 

Usually I would make both regular and gluten free cookies but the couple weeks leading up to the dinner were plaged by storms/power outages/school closures. It's just me in the kitchen and I worked double time trying to accomplish everything by the scheduled dinner day on top of my regular cafeteria cooking.

The thought and time slipped past me when it came to the gluten free cookies. I apologized to the student (age 11), and although disappointed, he seemed understanding, or so it seemed.

The next day the Mom came to the cafeteria to confront me about purposely excluding her child from dessert. Again, I apologized. I explained the entire meal was gluten free so it wasn't like there was no food available. She stated I should have offered him an alternative dessert like the frozen yogurts or popsicles we sell during recess. I disagreed, saying that the children who do not like gingerbread didn't get an option of another dessert. I was not prepared to have those options for all the kids, so sadly it couldn't be an option to him. 

I told her I had intended to have a gluten free cookie but sadly didn't get a chance to make them due to the power outages/school closures. She told me I should consider working harder. I told her I was sorry my best wasn't good enough for her. She told me I was not considerate or inclusive enough and I had a vendetta against her kid. At this point I had enough of her and could not hold my diplomacy and told her to get out of the cafeteria. She stormed off to the office and filed a formal complaint. She also took the school Facebook group to complain, and several parents seem to be agreeing with her, which honestly enrages me. 

I don't feel like I'm the asshole here. I tried to be inclusive and have something for everyone. I would love to accommodate every food whim of every kid in the school but that would be impossible. I'm considering refusing to do a holiday dinner next year because of this. What do ya'll think?

Edit : I apologize for using the word whim. I know how serious gluten allergies are. This was wrote out of frustration and it was definitely the wrong word choice. ",1
"This situation began a year ago and blew up in our faces last week.

My son Gregory is 13 years old. He just began the 8th grade. His friend, Peter, is also 13 and began the 8th grade too.

Gregory and Peter have been friends since elementary school. Last year, I noticed that Gregory would be ravenously hungry after school every day. He would come home and eat a frozen dinner or something, and then help himself to seconds at dinner time. I chalked this up to him being a 12-year-old boy and let it be.

Something about the situation was nagging at me though, and while Gregory wasn't clear about why at first, he eventually came clean. Peter was being sent to school every day with no lunch. It looks to me like a typical case of neglectful and unfit parents. The one time that Gregory went to their house he came home with comments about it smelling really bad and his Peter's parents locking themselves in the garage for hours.

Feeling bad for Peter, I decided to discretely begin giving Gregory more food every day, just about doubling all his food. Over time I became less discrete and began packing a separate lunch for Peter. I was never thanked for this by anyone, but I knew Peter was eating the food I sent.

This year, things are different. Money is tighter for personal reasons and frankly with how expensive things are, I have decided not to spend exorbitant amounts of money supporting someone else's child. I sat Gregory down and told him that I would be packing him one lunch which is for him and him alone. I made it extremely clear: do not share with anyone, and this includes Peter. 

Gregory followed my instructions until one day last week I got a phone call from Peter's mother. She was livid that I had cut Peter off without a single word. I asked her when it became my responsibility to feed her son, and she responded that if she had known I wasn't sending Gregory to school with ""too much food,"" she would have handled it herself. I asked if she remembered why I began sending him to school with two lunches in the first place and she hung up on me.

I feel conflicted. I know I'm having my kindness thrown back in my face, but did I approach this situation incorrectly?",1
"My (16, M) family has a pet parrot. They are all pretty much obsessed with him and my younger and older sisters both keep buying him toys, new food, making him new fruit and vegetable mixes to try out etc. My parents also pay a lot of attention to him and even set up the extra room we have for his cage so he can sleep better at night. He has been with us for a few months now and my family's obsession still hasn't died down.

I've been mostly indifferent since I'm not the biggest fan of animals and my parents keep him away from my room. Luckily for me it seems like he doesn't like me anyways so it's even easier to avoid him flying to my shoulder or anything like that. 

The problem though is that today my sister Emma (10,F) was talking quietly to that bird. She was holding him and saying things like ""You know I love you right?"" and kissing him on the head while the parrot would just mimic the sound. It went on for a while and she repeated that enough that it seemed like she was looking for a response so I told her ""You know he doesn't understand you right"". 

After I said that she just looked at me and made a sour face and ignored me. I didn't want her to actually believe this bird can understand what she is saying since she watches a lot of Disney movies so I feel like they could have given her the wrong idea. I gently explained to her that it's just a bird and that he doesn't understand things like we do. She told me to stop bothering her and ended up leaving the room and told my mom about it.

My mom told me she believed it was harmless for my sister to talk to her pet and that the bird ""reciprocated her feelings"". So I told her that this will harm my sister's way of thinking and get her bullied at school. She told me to drop it and not get involved anymore. AITA? I think my sister is old enough to understand what I'm saying and my mom is just too nice.",1
"My fiancee and I are getting married tomorrow. My work is facing an emergency that's been brewing since late Thursday. This emergency, if we can't stop it, would cause an environmental disaster. My entire team went down to the site between yesterday and today. I've been delaying because of the wedding, but I ultimately can't not go.

I'm working it out with my boss, and the company is willing to pay the entire cost of the cancelled honeymoon and pay for an equivalent one for me to stay around for this. It's too late to cancel the wedding in any aspect, and I don't want to. If I leave around 2 tomorrow, it's enough time for the ceremony and some pictures. I'll have to miss the reception, but I don't know that that's worse than canceling. We'd be out the entire cost, and we couldn't afford to redo it later. Some relatives are already in town for this, and the ones that aren't can't cancel at this point.

My fiancée wants to cancel the reception and just do a new one later. I think that's stupid. I realize it's a little awkward to have a wedding reception with just the bride, but my wife/fiancée can use it to see her distant family and hang out with her friends. It's not like she's going to be alone. My mother can handle my side of the family. My new wife won't have to do anything awkward. I haven't met a lot of my wife's extended family, but I can just meet them at Easter.

We're having an extra photoshoot after I get back. She's really mad at me about this. I don't want to start a marriage like this, but it's going to be far worse to start one with no job because I got fired due to a company scandal amidst a major news story. Am I really the asshole here?",1
"My little brother  ""Matthew"" (15M) and I are from Mississippi. He's gay  but he hides alot of his less than masculine interest like his love of flowers and gardening from his friends and teammates cause  ""they wouldn't get it"". He has a boyfriend  "" Taylor"" (16M) that he met at wrestling meet last year.  Taylor's a really nice  and sweet kid who also plays sports but is OUT and a bit more ugh ""fancy"" than Matthew.   He'll

I try to be there for him as his big sister buttt I'm not in school with him anymore and there's only so much  me and mom can do at home. He was supposed to be hanging out with Taylor Saturday after practice but then I got a call from him all upset asking me to pick him up and wouldn't tell me what was wrong. I was only like 5 min away so I was like sure. When I pulled up I caught him and Taylor arguing about how Taylor embarrassed him bring him flowers infront of his teammates and Taylor was telling him its not his fault he's scared to be himself.

Taylor just sulked off and went home and Matthew got in the car crying.  I asked what that was about and he tells me about how he's getting called Taylor's ""old lady"" or the ""girl"" because of how Taylor is with him and that Taylor just embarrassed him.Idk why but that just mad me mad. I pulled over at a gas station and told Matthew straight to his face that he was being a coward and a dick to to Taylor. I told him how I wished! I had a guy that treated me as well as Taylor treats him and even put up with all his shit.  I asked why he doesn't just stand up to those assholes instead of taking it out on Taylor.He just sat there looking at me stunned and cried more.. He wouldn't talk to me the rest of the ride home. Mom thinks I was to harsh with him.. AITA here?",1
"I (32m) and my son are currently living with my mom, and have been basically since covid. It's been fine, until the last year or so. She is constantly negative and never holds herself at fault. Always someone else to blame or some way to try and play victim. I have continued to block it off and never say anything. But I have finally snapped back.

As I said, it has gotten worse over the last year. Questions everything I do. I can't even walk out the front door to go somewhere with my son without being questioned where I'm going, what I'm doing. And if I don't then, then it's like 5 phone calls and some texts asking where I am and when I'll be back home.

It's gotten to the point where I just don't even talk to her, and just keep myself and my son secluded in our rooms. Finally snapped today though, and she called and started asking me things i already told her i was doing, and i responded to one of her questions with a yes and some attitude behind it. She got angry and started going off about how I am an asshole all the time, never talk to her, and never allow her to talk to my son. I told her why and that it's because she constantly questions me and treats me like I'm incapable and never know what I'm doing. She immediately got defensive, and hung the phone up on me.

Got home tonight after this and then it became all about how nobody is appreciative, tries to help her around the house or anything. I told her again, because she questions everything like we're stupid, and when people try to help she gets pissed off and runs around saying she has to redo it all, and nobody is doing anything right (her way). Then she starts ranting that nobody wants her around except to pay bills. When in reality I have offered multiple times and she tells me no, and to keep saving so I can get out with me and my son.

So I have been legitimately buying and cooking dinners, for everyone (4 people spending almost half of my checks every week not just me and my son) as a way to pay in some way and she doesn't seem to realize that. She stormed off when I said that. 5 mins go by and then comes back out and starts blaming us for why my sister doesn't talk to her, or how no one tries to defend her against my sister on why she doesn't get to she her grandchildren from her and told her it's not my place and get ""wtf ever!"" And back into her room and is now pouting.

So I guess AITA for Finally speaking up against her? ",1
"Earlier tonight I ordered a Hawaiian pizza with my boyfriend. We’ve only been dating a month so it’s the first time I ate pizza with him. We only finished about half, and then we went to watch TV. I was still hungry, so I ate all the toppings off the pizza. 

When he saw, he absolutely flipped out. He said that he was saving it for lunch tomorrow, that he had never met anyone who would do anything like this, and was just generally really upset. I thought he was joking and laughed it off, but it’s been a couple hours and he is still upset. He’s talking about how he was looking forwards to having the leftover pizza for lunch, and now I’ve ruined his lunch.

I offered to buy him another pizza, but he kept saying that it wasn’t about that, and I just ruined his day. 

Is he overreacting or AITA?",1
"I (44m) am divorced and have been for over ten years now. My ex wife and I have two children, one son Ben 19, and one daughter Lauren 17. My ex wife and I split custody 50/50 and I paid child support on time every month as well as ensured our children had everything that they needed for sports and other activities. At a young age I started a college fund/early life starter fund for the kids which they were aware of and has grown to be a large amount through the years. 

Over the years I have always had my children on my time and tried to be present in their lives. Ben has always been happy to come to my home, have family time, tell me about his life.. have a father/son role pretty much. 

Lauren on the other hand is the total opposite. She pulled away at a young age and when she was old enough to decide for herself she cut me out pretty much 100%. I spent years reaching out to her and trying to build some type of bridge with her but nothing ever worked. She went to a few different therapists and I can only hope it helped it in some other aspects of her life, but it certainly didn’t help in a family role. 

Other the past few years my son has become angry with his sister and calls her ridiculous. I’ve told him to not mind that and it’s not her fault, but him leaving for college changed me on the whole thing. When he left it felt like I lost my only child, and I gave up trying to have a relationship with Lauren. She never reached back out and neither did I. It felt terrible at first, but it’s much easier to deal with mentally for me. 

A few weeks ago Lauren and her mother reached out to talk about her college tuition and where she had decided to go. They asked me if I wanted to go walk the school with them again, and I declined. I told them that I felt I was only being invited because my check book was needed. I informed my ex and Lauren that I would not be paying for college or any other of her expenses after her 18th birthday (June), and that I was going to use the money elsewhere.

My ex blew up at me, my daughter didn’t say anything, and when they told my son he called to tell me he thought I was right and Lauren was to blame. I wasn’t a fan they told him to begin with however now there’s a rift between the three of them.

Should I just let this whole thing go and pay for her education? WIBTA if I stuck to my decision?

*update* 

I want to thank everyone for their time and comments.
A lot of you have ensured me this is the correct course while others have disagreed and been pretty rude. This is the best course and I’ll simply retire early and help my son with his first home. 

I don’t expect to have a relationship with my daughter ever again, and that’s something I need to make peace with. I won’t serve as her ATM when she’s in need though, and with child support ending in July it will no longer be my concern. Therapy hadn’t helped her much in the last several years so I doubt she’ll miss that much any way.",1
"I am a university (international) student, and I have no relatives or close friends yet. Me and my roommate are not close or anything. So because my mom lives in another country, she is constantly worried about me, especially since I have no one in case I go missing or something (I am yet to make friends).

&#x200B;

So I gave my mom my roommate's phone number. I hadn't met her yet; I had received her information from the leasing agency before we even moved in together, so I just gave my mom as insurance and forgot to ask when we moved in. I never really thought it was a big deal. Yesterday around 3 am, my phone stopped working, my lcd broke or something, so I couldn't call my mom, and I talk to my mom every day or at least send her text. My mom was worried about me, so she called my roommate multiple times until she answered, and when she answered, my roommate told her I was around after checking my room. My roommate came to me and explained that my mom called and said she didn't feel comfortable that I gave her no. to my mom. I told her I was sorry and I would make sure this incident didn't repeat itself. but it did'nt help. She said f\*\*ck me and was abnormally mad, and she even threatened to take legal action. I am not sure if she has a case, but is this an American thing where it is culturally unacceptable because I genuinely had no idea?

"I (M27) recently started talking more with a mutual friend (F25) about personal things in our lives. We know each other through my roommate from a while back. She's currently down on her luck financially and housing insecure, and I'm having issues getting a relationship. To clarify, there are no romantic or sexual feelings between us whatsoever, nor have I ever felt any such feelings for her. 

Recently, she helped me avoid a big mistake in pursuing a girl online and got me to go no contact, which I thought was a big step in our friendship. I felt sorry about her situation, but recently an idea came to me: sell anonymous feet/sexual pics for money. 

I know it's a sensitive issue to bring up to any female person since they are so frequently sexualized, but in the end, the money would go a long way in helping her get back on her feet, and plus, the plan is fairly pragmatic (possible ASD talking). 

I brought it up to her, and she said ""fuck no, my nudes are worth way more than what some OF creeps would pay, which is only $X/month anyway. and im not devaluing myself for OF fucks"" I replied that her nudes are worth nothing if she doesnt sell them, and that even $X is better than nothing, right? Especially if it's anonymous, and costs nothing but a few minutes of picture taking? also, I can't think of better or easier ideas, and plus there's no moral debasement for taking nudes, it says nothing about your ""value.""  

I was honestly just defending a good idea that was rejected on what I thought were irrational grounds, as I would any other idea, but I wasn't even going to defend it more than once. Either way, she flipped out over my reply and called me a perv. I think she is blowing things way out of proportion. 

AITA?",1
"I have always said I didn’t want kids of my own. However, I became very close with my niece and nephew. I babysat them; they’ve spent weekends with me. When they were little, my brother and SIL asked me to be their guardian should anything happen to them. I agreed, because they are truly the only kids I could see myself raising. Niece is now 11 years old and nephew is 10 years old. I got married 3 years ago and my wife felt the same as me about not having kids. She’s very good to my niece and nephew. However, I never told her about what I agreed to with my brother and SIL.

Last year, my SIL passed quite unexpectedly. It’s been very hard on my brother. My wife and I have been helping him out a lot. Last week, my brother sat us down and said he was updating his own will. He got a sizable life insurance policy from SIL’s death and he’s put most of it into trusts for the kids. He wanted us to be in charge of the trusts in the event of his passing. We agreed. Then my brother mentioned adding my wife as guardian in the will as we never did that. My wife was confused and I told her that before we even met, I had agreed to be the kids’ guardian. She got all freaked out and started saying we agreed on no kids, this wasn’t no kids, etc. This started upsetting my brother as he worried his kids wouldn’t have anyone to raise them (we’re literally the only options). I told my brother that I’d talk to my wife about it.

She’s pretty pissed that I never told her this before. I told her it shouldn’t matter, would she really let these kids be orphaned if their dad died? I said my brother dying probably isn’t going to happen before they’re 18. She pointed out we didn’t think SIL would either. She basically relented and said she’d become guardian but I’d be doing all of the work with them. I called her selfish for viewing my niece and nephew as a burden. Now we’re barely talking.

My friend has told me that I am being an ass and I can’t be surprised at my wife’s reaction. Upon further reflection, I wonder if he’s right. AITA?

Update: Wow, you guys have been loud and clear. I was an asshole. To those wishing my marriage would fall apart, congratulations! Wife left this morning. ",1
"I (30F) love my husband (27M). He’s charming, quick witted, handsome, funny when he wants to be, and is the type of person everyone is drawn to. I was the one to ask him out, to say I love you, to kiss him, to plan our dates, to file the paperwork. He’s not particularly affectionate. I think he wouldn’t have proposed to me had his family not expected it. Nevertheless, I’m very happy. 

Recently, I went to a dermatologist about two growing spots on my body. It turns out that they were semi-benign tumors that could turn cancerous. I had them removed. I asked my long time friend Amy (30F) to be my support person as the surgeon required someone else take care of me. Amy is a very touchy feely person and we’re basically sisters. I felt that I needed affection. I did the surgery on a week where my husband would be away. It went smoothly. 

My husband noticed the bandages yesterday and asked if I got hurt. I had to tell him the truth and told him it was a small operation. He said that it was cruel of me to ask Amy instead of him. I told him I didn’t want to burden him and he got even more irritated. My parents heard about this and told me that I did the right thing but when I told my friends, they said it was an a hole move especially to Amy who took a day off to help me?",1
"So today I got a message from some old friend I didn’t keep contact with them (lets call them the boys), the message was saying that we should do a group reunion on the day that we became friends, the problem is that we left off on bad terms because of me.

Context:

This hapend when I was in highschool the boys planed a group date and almost all agreed to be assholes except Matt (me best mate) who directly refused and me who just smiled and didn’t say anything, on that night we went to a bar that my fiend\`s father owned to meet with the girls, At that time I didn’t know who we were meeting, and when the girl came in I noticed that most of them were friends of mine and that one girl I had a crush on her (she was pretty I won't lie and had almost the same taste as I). The night didn’t go so well ,the boys were throwing cringy remarks at my female friends and almost every time I said something to counter those comments (I did have a better friendship with some of my female friends that most of the boys) , About 30 min of this shit I told Matt that I had enough and we both decided to GTFO, when we stood up and walked out all of the girls left too (pretty sure that they were staying to not hurt our friendship) and we decided to go to another bar and have a better time just me and matt but planes changed and we went as a group (me, matt, the F friend, and my crush).

The next day was the day that we brock ut with the boys because they were accusing me and Matt of keeping the girls for us and that we agreed on all being assholes, but I quickly reminded them that I DIDN’T agree and just blinked at the idea.

After that we all went out separate way, except matt we now own a car rental company ,  and we are both engaged to on a girl who was in that shit show (me with my \`crush\` and matt with my best freind)

So was I the asshole to the boys by not being the asshole to the girls",1
"I am 26 today (m) and currently in a central asian country (something with stan). 

7 years ago I came to this country and helped in an orphanage and ever since I had been sponsering supporting and family to two boys (now V who is 16 and M who is 15)

They live in an orphanage and for the last 7 years I supported them both mentally (we talk daily on the phone) and financially (I the only one who buys them clothes as they recieve worn down too big or too small clothes from their state, I send them gifts, bought and pay for their phone, send them pocket money and even buy them food (online) when they dont get enough food or the food is extremely yacky that day. 

I visist them at least once a year taking two long flights every direction just to spend time with them. Usually I come at winter to have christmas with them (I am Christian) and I get to have them spend few days with me only during daytime in a small town next to their orphanage. 

This time I won't be able to visist this winter so I decided to fly in the summer, they both got to work during summer vacation so they were both in the capital and instead of our usual small town we spent a week in the capital and they were allowed to be with me the entire time. 

It just happened to be that my birthday is on the last day of the visit (wasnt intentionally just the dates matched). 

V who lived with me the entire week was mad that I woke him up at 12 to get breakfast and after answering me with grunts when I asked him what else he wants me to buy him and what kind of breakfast he wants I left him to sleep in the hotel and went alone. M told me two days ago that he is leaving to work in another city and that he won't be staying with me the last two days. That was after I didnt agree to buy him a again phone after he broke the fithed one that I bought hin and ignored me because I installed a tracker on his phone (he knew about it because it was in a contract between us that he signed and a condition for me to buy him a phone) 

I am currently alone waiting for my vaffles in a cafe wondering if I am over reacting or what did I do wrong. 
I don't ask them for a a parade, on their birthday I send them cake, a gift, candy and money and of course call and talk to them. I even took them to celebrate a birthday with a friend of them in an arcade and a sports park last december (it was V's)

I just thought that a simple happy birthday in the morning would be nice, and maybe willingness to spend some time with me. 

So verry sorry for the long post but am I wrong to be mad? 
I need some outside opinions",1
"My husband (38M) and I (35F) have been married for 10 years and have 3 kids (9, 6, & 3).  I have been a SAHM ever since our first born.  It's easier now that the older 2 are in school, but it's summer right now so they are home all the time.  The company my husband works for has given employees the option to work from home since Covid started.  Of course, people can still choose to go to the office is they want, but it's not required at all. It's been great for us as a family because his office is almost an hour commute away so we are saving a lot of money on gas and other expenses that go along with a commute of that length.  

But over the last month or so, my husband has been going into the office more and more regularly.  Some weeks he will only work from home one day.  He has his own dedicated office in our house and the kids know not to bother him. He keeps the door locked while he's working and the rest of us leave him alone.  No one pesters him or asks him for anything while he's working.  Yes, I'm sure he can probably still hear the noise the kids make during the day, but I doubt it's any more distracting than working in a cubicle farm.

When he works from home, it makes my daily life so much easier.  He can help with the kids in the morning before he starts work, he's right there when his workday ends so he can watch the kids while I start dinner, and in an emergency he can help if I need it.  Our youngest got a large splinter a couple months ago that required an ER visit so I asked him to watch the older kids while I took care of the youngest.  

I asked him why he is going to the office more often and he told me he feels like he's more productive at the office and since he got a promotion 3 months ago he feels it sets a good example that he's dedicated and it gives him the opportunity to have a lot of face-to-face conversations with people, which he feels is important.

I told him how much more helpful it is to me when he's home and he told me that summer is almost over and the older kids will be in school soon anyway so I should just wait it out for another few weeks.  But with his commute, he's gone for over 10 hours every day and he's losing 2 hours of time at home every day.  That's time that could instead be used to help me at home, or spent with our kids. 

I told him that I want him to work from home more often and he told me that I don't get to decide how he works.  He said his job allows us the comfortable life we have and he doesn't want to jeopardize that.  He said he would try to stay home more often, but he refused to promise anything or set a scheduled amount of days that he would stay home.

He told me he doesn't tell me how to spend my time at home, so I shouldn't tell him how to do his job, which I felt was uncalled for because my time at home doesn't effect his job the way him staying home effects me. I just want a little extra help sometimes.",1
"My (37m) sister (29f) is getting married in June. I have two daughters one neurotypical (7f) and one high needs nonverbal autistic daughter (5f). 

My sister made a rule about her wedding no kids under 5, which I think was a ""polite"" way of excluding my disabled child. My wife or myself would have immediately took her outside if she had a meltdown. As my 6 year old nephew (also neurotypical) just ""made the cut"" and gets to go, there's only two other children under 5 in the family no known disabilities yet. I understand her wedding her choice, but I'm not okay with including one of my daughters but not the other. 

Problem is my 7 yr old daughter really wanted to go, she's a real ""girly girl"" loves pretty dresses, princesses, fairies, and yes brides too. She was excited getting to see her aunt in a bridal gown (the last wedding she went to she was too young to remember). 

Since it is my sister I don't feel right missing her wedding so we are going without the girls and my in-laws will watch them that night. 

She's upset she doesn't get to go, and my sister says I'm fostering resentment but I think Im teaching my daughter it's not okay to exclude family due to a disability. The way I see it it's my sister who created this situation, not me. 

AITA?

EDIT CORRECTION: Rule is no kids 5 and under, my apologies should have specified that.",1
"So while the title sounds bad, please read, hope to clarify why I did it.

My brother and me get along great and when we were younger, we'd try to include each other in any celebrations/birthdays, etc. So like when we were 7, at each of our birthdays, we'd blow out the candles together, or when he graduated high school he'd make the party about me too (I graduated the following year and also used my party to also celebrate his successful first year in college).

Last weekend was my brother's wedding and since we were so close and generally had no problem sharing the spotlight, I figured I'd propose to my girlfriend. After some dancing where couples danced with their SOs, I went to the DJ and asked him to quiet down the music. I got down on one knee and made my proposal. My girlfriend was ecstatic, people congratulated us, etc. My brother also congratulated us, but about a half an hour later he came up to me and asked to speak privately.

He told me he didn't have a problem with my proposal, but that his now-wife complained to him and called me a bunch of names. I told my brother I'd talk to her, but I was upset that his wife didn't just come to me to talk about what happened and was acting passive aggressive about it.

When his wife had a moment to herself, I went up to her and apologized and said I should have asked her permission first. She went off on me and told me how I ruined the wedding.

I told her she's being dramatic and everyone is having a good time. Unfortunately me and his wife were never really on the best of terms, I told her I didn't think my brother should have ever married her and I hope they get divorced.

Me and my fiancee left early, couldn't find my brother or wife anywhere and we haven't spoken since then.",1
"I was estranged from my brother Tom for almost a decade. A lot happened during that time including my getting married and becoming a dad and my brother winning the lotto. How much? Enough to where he has a chauffeur. We reconciled a year ago after our parents passed away. 

Things are pretty tight financially with us. I don't want my three boys to worry about it. Unfortunately my eldest ""Max"" is 17 figured it out. He's 17 and needs new clothes. I offered to take him shopping and he said he's fine. This is the same boy who put the lunch money I gave to him back in my wallet because he didn't want me to go hungry.

Tom and Max are very alike and became close.  I think Max told Tom about being teased over his clothes (something I didn't know about) and gave a $1000 e-card to Amazon to buy clothes. I was furious. I told Tom he made me look stupid in front of my kid and like I can't provide. He told me it was his ""business"" and wasn't going to stand by and watch his nephew not have new clothes. I said Max could get a part time job.

My other boy is turning 9 this Saturday and wanted a bowling party. For that, I allowed Tom to pay for the lanes, shoes, food and arcades. I found out that he actually rented out the whole place instead. And his present? A $3,000 3D printer.

I told Tom he's making me look bad as a father and to stop giving money out. He said I should kiss his ass for helping out. I told him to fuck off.",1
"Edit: Thank you for everyone who responded. I can definitely see that most of you agree we are both TA here. (I have read a lot of the YTA comments, most of them said we are both TA) And she was definitely being dramatic over the fainting comment. We have worked past this issue now and on good terms again!

My(29M) and my wife (29F) both value our independence. We make around the same money. We keep our finances separate and we each pay half of the rent.We are currently traveling together in a walkable city and we are living in a hotel. We don’t qualify for the free breakfast. So we basically have to buy food from nearby restaurants because the hotel's restaurants are super expensive. I have to admit that money is tight, we can only travel on a careful budget.

This morning I got up early and went and got a nice but small breakfast burrito for myself. My wife woke up and claimed she’s hungry and wanted to walk to a nearby place to get some food for herself. (Even when we are at home, we almost never eat breakfast together) The problem is that she demanded I give her a chunk of my breakfast burrito so she could walk outside and get some food for herself. I told her that I had paid for my breakfast and it’s already fairly small so I can’t let her have some, otherwise it wouldn't be enough for me. She said she needed to eat something in the morning so she doesn’t “faint” during the walk to get her own food, which I completely don’t understand since she only needs to walk a few blocks to find food. I told her I’ll give her a chunk of my burrito if she is going to let me have a chunk of her food once she gets it. She called me petty and just walked out. And she had been giving me a passive-aggressive attitude since then.So Reddit, AITA?",1
"The title might make me look like an a-hole but please bear with me. So my wife is pregnant and we're having a twin. I suggested the names Fred and George if they are both boys And Lily and Molly for girls. My wife is okay with Lily and Molly since we both have multiple deceased relatives in extended families with those names and it would be honoring them first and book names later.

"Made an account for this, I don't think I'm being unreasonable but perhaps I need a wider and maybe younger perspective on the situation.

My daughter is 24 and has been dating her boyfriend for around 10 months. It's her fathers 60th birthday this year and we're having a big party at our house with lots of relatives. Daughter and her boyfriend are invited and are staying as they don't live too close and want to drink. 

We were discussing sleeping arrangements and after listing off a few others the following conversation happened

me: ""you can have your room but you'll have to share with your aunt and boyfriend can sleep on the futon in the study"" 

her:""what, why can't me and boyfriend have my room and aunt sleep in the study?""

m:""I don't think you and boyfriend should be sharing a room""

h:""older sister and husband are sharing!""

m:""Older sister and husband are married, it's completely different""

h:""so you'll only take my relationship seriously if I get married? What if I never get married? Me and boyfriend aren't going to do anything at my parents house anywayso why does it matter and why is it OK for sister and husband to have sex at your house just because they have a stupid piece of paper.""

m:""I just don't like the idea of it under my roof, what you do elsewhere is up to you but at my house I think I get a say in these things, I'm sure you'll be fine without each other for 1 night""

h:""you don't take me or my relationship seriously, I'm an adult but you don't treat me like one, it doesn't matter if it's one night it's the principle behind it""

She left after this and we haven't been able to come to a conclusion, I still don't want them sharing a bed at my house and my daughter is saying she wont stay if they can't. There are no nearby hotels as well live quite a way out in the country so if they didn't stay they'd have to leave early to get home and wouldn't be able to enjoy the party as much.

Husband says he doesn't much like the idea of them sharing either but wants his daughter to be there on his birthday. I don't know what to do here, I really don't think I'm asking much for one night of them not sleeping together, but maybe I am being unreasonable?

Edit: I posted this on reply to a comment but thought I should add it to the original post as well:

I intend to call my daughter and firstly let her know that I did not intent to make her feel like I don't view her as an adult and that clearly this relationship is important to her so it should be important to me too. I'm afraid I'm rather set in my ways and although all these posts have been very enlightening my feelings aren't going to flip like a switch and change instantly. That being said, my daughter is more important to me then my own personal beliefs and if changing my attitude is what it takes to keep a strong relationship with her in certainly willing to put in the effort. To make a long story short, they can share the bed.",1
"Just a quick one, as it's really caused more controversy between me (28m) and gf (28f) than it should imo..

We were at the cinema last night, it was absolutely packed, not a single empty seat in the place.

Around half way through the film, during a ""lull"" in the action (the film was quite quiet at this part, so any noise/conversation could have been clearly heard), a woman who was sitting around 6-7 seats down from us, got up, as she must have needed to go to the bathroom or grab some snacks or whatever. She slowly made her way through the sea of legs in her way when unfortunately for her, she stumbled over someones legs and tripped, falling face first onto my lap (only for 1-2 seconds) and she then got herself to her feet, looking mortified and apologised to me.

At this point, everyone had glanced over due to the commotion, i could see that she was horrified and embarrassed, due to my general nature/demeanor, i decided id crack a joke to make her feel better/laugh at the situation, so i said ""no worries, usually i have to pay for that kind of service."" - it worked, not only did she laugh, but a large majority of the cinema laughed. 

Anyway, everything was cool, the film was decent and the plan was, for me and my gf to go to a restaurant afterwards, the film finished and my gf was giving me the cold shoulder, saying she didn't feel well and wanted to go home, i asked what was wrong, she snapped ""nothing, take us home, i dont feel well!"".

After chipping away at her on the drive home, it turns out, i had  been an asshole because i ""embarrassed"" her by making a joke that the whole cinema heard and put ""unwanted"" attention onto her.

I told her ""you had no attention on you, i was the one who made the joke, i don't see what the issue is here?"" She had no response and hasn't spoken to me since, now the atmosphere in the apartment is awkward as hell, but i'm resisting the urge to come up with another joke lol, AITA here? should i not have tried to lighten the mood in the cinema?

**EDITED FOR UPDATE**

Wow, this took an interesting turn, i've been super busy, read through a large majority of replies, will answer the ones i can remember seeing, thank you for your time/opinions, it's been a real eye-opener! I feel i didn't really do the story justice which has caused some people to assume (wrongly) certain things which they've then used to fit their narratives, so, for that, i'm sorry. 

1) I'm from the UK (this kind of humour is generally accepted/well recieved)

2) The film we watched was James Bond License to Kill (a local cinema was showing it due to it being the 60th anniversary)

3) The woman who tripped gave a genuine laugh, it wasn't an ""awkward"" laugh, when she returned to the cinema to take her seat, she smiled and patted me on the shoulder and said ""i'll try not to trip over this time"" whilst chuckling to herself.

4) The joke was in no way meant to be sexist, i was raised by my mum and my aunt with no male presence, they raised me to always respect women (and everyone tbh). I can however, certainly see why people did think i was TA based on their assumptions of the situation, it was definitely a ""you had to be there"" moment i guess, in regards to people comparing what i said to ""then everyone clapped"", you misread, i did say ""a large majority"" laughed, not ""everyone"", there were certainly people who were indifferent to it or didn't find it funny.

5) I showed my gf most of these comments and asked her what actually upset her, it turns out she was unhappy about something her friend had said to her earlier in the day and was stewing on it all day, she used the incident as an excuse to go home, as she ""didn't want to ruin the night by continuing to pretend she was happy"". We're all good, she loves my sense of humour, as i do hers, so there's no issue there.

6) I respect everyones opinions and i'll accept the judgement of being an AH or a soft AH, but i refuse to change who i am as a person, i've always had this kind of sense of humour/personality, as with most things, it's all about the intent, my intent was to make her feel less awkward and make her laugh, which i did. My intention was not to incinuate she or anyone else was a sex worker or to be sexist. i will say however, i'm shocked at how divided people seem to be on the subject matter. Also, thank you very much for those of you who have reached out via PM, you're good people <3.

Anyway, i'll keep an eye on here and attempt to answer anything else that comes up, take care everyone, be good, and if you can't be good, be safe. :)",1
"I have 3 kids (14, 11 and 6) me and their dad divorced 5 years ago. 
3 years ago I meet my current partner, who is fantastic and the kids love. We’ve bought a house and there’s lots of happiness. 

My ex was a narcissist, the world owes him everything and his multiple affairs are why we split. When I met my current partner he kicked off and middle child went to live with him (long story, however not my choice, lawyers, social work etc couldn’t do anything  and if he was happy I was happy). Ex has been disgruntled for years because I have a good job, house and happy relationship. He’s unemployed, living with the woman he had the affairs with and her kids (who he openly dislikes). The only way he can get to me is the kids, specifically middle one who has always been close to his dad, as the other 2 don’t entertain it. 

Middle child due to living with his dad is slowly turning into him. I can’t do right for doing wrong. He is treated the same as the other two, but due to being king of the castle at his dads this isn’t good enough. 
Contact is ruled by an 11 year old, even though I have court orders for access. Ex encourages him not to come and promises the world. It’s getting increasingly frustrating as I send the others every week as agreed, and middle child is a no show- unless there’s something in it for him. Eg a birthday, Christmas, an event where he’ll get more here than he would at his dads. This weekend things came to a head when it was oldest child’s birthday and middle one decided he’d come for the day, act horribly because it wasn’t his day specifically and left early because the bbq was over. He made the others cry, after he left I cried. It’s a horrible situation. 

Next year we’ve booked a holiday to DisneyWorld Florida. This is not a cheap holiday (from UK) and likely a once in a lifetime one for us all. We booked for all 3 kids. 

However due to middle child’s attitude, not only with me, but with my partner and the other 2 kids I’m considering not taking him. It’s not in any way that I don’t want him to come, but I don’t want the holiday ruined for everyone because of his attitude and new self entitlement. 

Long story short - WIBTA if I don’t take one of my 3 kids on family holiday.

Edited to WIBTA

Edit for INFO None of them know about the holiday yet, we booked at the start of the year and plan on telling them at Christmas time (mainly so we didn’t have 18 months of being asked how long til the holiday)
His attitude has really flipped since February. I’ve tried sitting him down and explaining he will be treated the same. He agrees he has a good time here, he’s happy here, but feels guilty leaving his dad. After this chat I sat down with ex and explained how he’s affecting middle child. Ex has now ramped up his assholery, and encouragement that middle kid can do what he wants with no consequence which isn’t how I work. I’m all for fair. I don’t speak badly about his dad. I don’t play games for him to want to come see us. I completely understand this is his dads doing, but it’s exhausting.
EDIT thank you for all the responses. I’ve changed it from Disneyland to DisneyWorld (apologies) 
Also middle child sees a counsellor through school, as does oldest. Ex would not attend other counselling I arranged or take middle one. This is something that’s being addressed, it’s just harder currently due to lockdown. As is the lawyer side of things, once the country is up and running again I’ll push a bit harder.",1
"Hi friends,

So my cousin is an adult now (23 or 24 M) and he grew up with 2 other siblings. He is not related to his father and has never been told that he has a different dad. My mother, uncle, and grandmother all say that it’s his own family’s business and that I need to leave it alone, but I can’t help but think that if no one told me about my origins I’d be upset. 

Would I be the asshole if I told him?

To be clear, I do not find issue with his mother having him by a different man and I fully acknowledge that the man who raised him is more of a father than the other guy ever was or will be. I am about a year or two older than my cousin and we were close growing up.

Edit: I want to add some (maybe?) pertinent info. My aunt has untreated bipolar disorder and narcissistic personality disorder. She always treated him as the scapegoat in the family and coddled the other two. My cousin was conceived with her (then) fiancé, but they ended up breaking up. My aunt has pushed away almost all of the family and only reaches out when she needs things. 

A lot of people have asked “why would you tell him?” My thought process is “doesn’t he deserve to know? Wouldn’t you be pissed if everyone knew and didn’t tell you?” 

One more edit for clarification: my mother is one of four siblings. My aunt is her sister. In this story I say “my mother, uncle, and grandmother”. So that’s my mom, her brother, and their mother. 

Update: I hope this doesn’t violate the rules, since the post is already voted on? If it does, someone let me know. 
I genuinely appreciate everyone’s feedback and I read every single comment (even the ones that were unkind). A lot of people mentioned that there’s very little practical reason to tell him, especially when the truth of the matter is that even if I do it will cause problems for every single member of the family. Emotionally, I want him to know. Practically, I think you all are right. While I have information from my mother, grandmother, and my uncle, I cannot answer all questions he may have. He already has a tense relationship with his mother (my aunt) and I think it would hurt that even more and not guarantee the answers he may want. Someone actually mentioned that just because he hasn’t officially been told doesn’t mean he doesn’t actually know, and that’s something I hadn’t really considered. I think you all are right. It’s just not my place. I hope when he finds out he isn’t angry, but you all are right. It just can’t be me. 
Again. I appreciate the feedback. ",1
"I (52M) have two daughters (17F) Angie&Julie. The girls are twins but are different in every way. 

Growing up Angie shared a lot more interests with my wife, she loved preforming in pageants, cheerleading, the whole nine yards. While Julie shared my enthusiasm for the outdoors, camping and wildlife photography. It wasn't intentional but over time my wife started spending more time with Angie while I spent more time with Julie. We tried taking the girl to more places together but it'll always end in an argument because they didn't have any shared interests and Julie hated going shopping or seeing her sister preform in pageants while Angie despised the outdoors and always refused to go camping with Julie and I. 

I'll say this now, I adore both my girls and I'm incredibly proud of both of them. But the bond I have with Julie is stronger due to our shared interests, same goes for Angie and my wife. 

Recently while bird watching Julie broke the camera we got her for her 15th birthday, it was an expensive camera and she was distraught because she knew we couldn't afford to buy her a new one. I knew how much that camera meant to Julie who wants to work in photography after graduation so I decided to take more overtime shifts and sell some of my personal belongings so I can efford to buy her a new one.

It took me a while but I ended up surprising her with a really nice camera and she was overjoyed, I told her she can repay me by making me an album with all the photos she takes throughout the year. 

Angie approached me the next day saying she needs a new dress for her upcoming pageant, this confused me a bit because she usually discusses things like that with my wife. I asked how much she needs and she says the dress wants is 4,050$

I told her I'm sorry but I can't effort to get her that dress right now and she might want to ask her mother. Angie said mom already told her no and she knows I could effort it because I bought Julie the camera. I tried explaining that a camera and a dress are different but she argued that I could just work more overtime and sell more of my stuff like I did for Julie. When I refused and told her to either find a cheaper dress or rent one she exploded and accused me of favoritism. Although my decision had nothing to do with favoritism I didn't bother denying it. 

She is now going to relatives complaining how I favorite Julie over her. From my point of view she can't really complain because my wife favors her over Julie. Besides most of our money already goes towards her pageants and dance competitions so she can't say I don't get her stuff. 

Some of my relatives are calling me a jerk for not denying the favoritism but I don't see the point. Angie obviously favors her mom over me and even told me so a couple of times but that doesn't mean she doesn't love me. So why is it treated differently the other way around? I could really use some insight, am I missing something? AITA?


EDIT 

I'll clear up some things since most of you are assuming things that never happened.

First off, I'm not rich. Really wish I was but I'm not. I'm an immigrant and so is my wife, I work as an ICU nurse and my wife is dance teacher. We make an honest living and that's about it.

Second of all, since most of you are worried about finances. I'll admit we don't spend the same amount of money on the girls. Angies hobbies are much more expensive for my wife and I to support. Makeup, dresses, travel, music lessons and pageant entree fees are much more expensive then the hiking boots, sleeping bag and tent Julie occasionally asks for. Julie didn't ask for the camera I surprised her with it, she is going to study photography right after HS and I wanted to show my support. Besides that, I also enjoy photography so the camera can be used by both of us for a long period of time. I got the camera on sale and it cost me 3,200$, it's a professional camera and she'll be able to use it for along time.

Third of all I LOVE BOTH MY DAUGHTERS. My wife and I try to take an active part in both their lives. I drive Angie to pageants, try to learn her choreography whenever I can and support her from the audience. My wife also make an effort to be in Julie's life. That being said, Angie spends more time with my wife because SHE chooses to do so, same goes for Julie spending time with me. We never denied our kids love or attention. The whole favoritism thing isn't new either, it's all in good fun and the girl are fine with it and they joke about it all the time. The only time Angie used it in an argument was when I refused to get her the dress. We love our daughters the same but it's just easier for me to get along with Julie and for my wife to get along with Angie. That's why I refer to it as favorite. I don't know how some of you interpreted that as me saying the girls are not loved, abused and tormented by the other parent but that's not the case. 

Forth of all, for those wondering I've discussed it with my wife and we are not getting Angie that dress. It's too big of an expense for a one time use. Angies behavior and how she asked for the dress are very unbecoming and made us wonder if we should encourage the girls to find a part time job because that level of entitlement is not something we encourage in our household.  

If any of you have any more questions feel free to ask, it's better then assuming stuff that never happened.",1
"So I (36m) have 2 children (13m + 10f) from a previous relationship. I have been with my wife (34f) for 8 years. We have twin boys (5m). We have had my older children religiously the whole time at weekends and during school holidays. As they have gotten older our house rules have differed from when they are at home with my ex. For example bed time is staggered by age at our house and things like no dessert if they don’t eat enough of their tea. 
With 4 children it is a busy household and a few rules help with controlling our time and ensuring we can do things as a family. 

Anyway over the last 12 months when my older children come over they have expressed their dislike for some of our rules mainly the no phones after lunch until after tea. (They can have them on them and reply to messages and calls however it’s just no sitting on social media) they can go on phones in the morning and after tea if we aren’t out doing things. During the day we try and do family activities such as bowling or cinema or bike rides and such or if we stay home it’s board games and just interacting as a family. As my older son is getting older me and my wife understand his weekends he likes to be with his friends and we will drop him off to where his friends are and pick him up at a set time (as we live the other end of the city) 

However now for the last 3 months they have refused to come to our house due to these rules and my ex asked me to compromise on these rules which I declined, mainly because it’s not the most aggressive and archaic of rules. (5-6 hours of no phones) plus it will start the spiral for my twins seeing that they can get what they want to if they express enough dislike. I have said the door will always be open for them and I won’t be forcefully making them come to our house. 

So AITA for not relaxing the rules so they come over just to sit on their phones… I don’t think it is too harsh but I am also feeling guilty that they don’t want to come over anymore.

With my ex they are allowed to cut their own routine and that’s fine there as it isn’t my house and whatever works for them. 

My wife agrees with our rules which are for all children and backs me 100% but I find myself questioning if I’m doing the right thing or not.

Edit- the 5 year olds do not have phones and they all don’t follow the same exact rules and the older children have their phones. They just can’t sit scrolling for 5 hours in the middle of the day when we have made plans and made an effort to do something as a family. It’s mainly one day a week too, the other day of the weekend, they are with their friends and have their phones with them and can do as they please with said phones. It’s just one day a week for 5 hours.

Further info: I don’t think I was quite as clear and gave all information. 

I still see the children every week during the week. They just don’t want to stay at the weekends, when they was coming we did one on one activities and stuff without the younger children too. It wasn’t a no phone rule but more like a “we have to have some sort of plan over the weekend where we get out of the bedroom and pocket the phone for a while. Even if they wanted to chill with mates that’s what they did. Friends came over or they went to a friends. I’ve had the discussion with the children and that’s how I found out about it just being the phone issue as initially they said it was all rules but it came down to just that one. Plus it’s not a set 5 hours every weekend but I just used 5 hours for this as that’s the maximum amount of time it could be.",1
"Throwaway because some of this made local news and I don't want it connecting back to me.

I work in a place where we are not allowed to have personal electronics on us at all. No phones, no smart watches, no pagers. I've been working here for about 6 months so my wife knows this and understands that she should not try to contact me by my cell at work. Phones are dropped off in our lockers and I typically have mine on Do Not Disturb. Before this incident, my phone has never gone off in the locker before.

Recently there was a pretty big fire at a secondary worksite that I do work at occasionally but that day I was working at the main building. Local news covered the fire before I found out about it because again no electronics, plus the work we do isolates us a bit so news travels pretty slowly. There were a few casualties, a lot of seriously injured folk. 

My wife had been watching the news from home and started freaking out, I guess. She called me 20 freaking times, which (and I did not know this was possible) overrode my DND and my phone was ringing for a while in my locker. In the middle of my shift, I got called into my managers office and was chewed out (and written up) for my phone making so much noise. They told me to go take care of whatever it was making my phone go off before I went back to work.

I won't lie...when I saw those 20 missed calls from my wife I was seriously pissed off. Like I said, she knows not to try to contact me directly and a citation hurt my chances of getting a raise or promotion. I called her back and she was sobbing and asking me if I was okay. I said of course I was okay and asked what the f\*ck was wrong with her to call me so many times. She was still crying and started talking about the fire. After that I started half-yelling at her about all the reasons it was dumb of her to call me.

When I got home she was super upset with me. I apologized for yelling but she refused to talk. She's been very chilly the past few days and sleeping in our daughter's room. I know it was not the best decision to yell at her but I still think my anger justified . 1) she knows I don't work in the secondary worksite very often. 2) she knows that I can't be contacted directly and she could have just called the office. 3) 20 calls is absolutely \*insane\*. Am I the asshole?",1
"My girlfriend is going on a business trip to Italy next month and will be there for about 5 days. She will be busy all day long and is letting me know she wont have much time for me but I dont see that as being a problem. For us funds are limited and with airfare and lodging being paid for (besides my flight, I plan on using credit card points from Amex so its ""free"") I think its a great way for us both to experience Italy for the first time.

I can go sightsee and do my own thing while she is at the conference, if she has a work dinner I can do that solo and meet up afterwards no problem. I do not mind exploring cities solo and actually like it and would still enjoy whatever time we did have together.

She doesnt seem interested in even trying to make it work and is throwing so many roadblocks at me that it feels weird she is being so adamant about how hard/impossible it will be for me to go. She has only been at this job for about 4 months so I see how that could be part of it but once again I can do my own thing and wouldn't impede on any of her business stuff. 

There are some real roadblocks we need to get past for me to be able to go and I understand those (we need someone to watch our dogs for up to 7 days, and I may need to stay somewhere solo a night or two because they have an Airbnb for a couple nights) but they dont seem impossible to overcome IMO.

I do not know when the next opportunity for us to go to Italy would be and not taking advantage of this opportunity for even 1 or 2 days together feels like a waste.

But what do you guys think AITA for wanting to go on this trip with her?

"i (20m) and my girlfriend (20f) are having a joint 21st with all our family and friends. we had a big list and after careful consideration came down to 100 people. however, over the past few months me and my group aren’t as close anymore. we’re all studying and doing our hobbies whilst balancing work and a girlfriend (for those who have one). recently i’ve been getting hate by one particular friend (we will call him Pete). he has been furious that i haven’t been out as much due to the aforementioned factors. it even got to the point where when i was free he would only go out of one our other friends (we’ll call him Mark) was going. this all ended when we agreed to make plans for my other friends (we’ll call him Baz) birthday. 

so Baz is up to his neck in work and can’t do something next weekend for his birthday but he made plans with another friend (Ryan) to watch sports at a pub. i was invited but had prior engagements in the form of my gfs cousins birthday. he’s a wee boy and didn’t have many family over so we were happy to go. i told baz and ryan that i would try to make it but i’m busy and may miss it, and that’s what happened. i messaged saying that i’d miss it but i got spam calls in return.

i finally left the party and headed home for food. me and my gf ordered some in and then i answered the call. it was Baz, Ryan and Pete. they started saying they were coming to my home and we were all going for food and bowling. obviously after eating i was not hungry and i promised my gf we could have a chill weekend as a party for tonight was unfortunately cancelled. they didn’t want to take no for an answer and instead suggested i “leave her in my room” and “book her a taxi now”. my gf has always been respectful and nice around my friends so this came as a shock.

after back and forth bickering i finally said no to which Ryan went ape on me saying “i always throw a spammer in the works” and that i “just can’t be arsed”. i found that offensive as i love boys time and when i was free and financially available i’d go. i hung up after this and received a message from Pete saying that he can’t be bothered with me because i don’t make effort (the same guy who doesn’t see me as a friend and refused to come out but still wants to  attend my party). 

anyways he ended the conversation by saying that this was all planned and i knew about it because it’s Baz’s birthday dinner tonight. this infuriated me as they knew i was busy in the day and we all were  meant to have a party again at nigh, so why make birthday plans the night of a party? (side note, Ryan’s girlfriend was the one hosting 😬) after this i spoke to my gf and agreed to take them off the list for the party. Ryan and Pete were already questionable as they haven’t treated me or my gf well for the past few months.

So, Am I The Asshole?",1
"My partner (28) and I (22) have lived in a small townhouse for 2 years. My mom (54) and little brother (17) moved in 2 months ago. She and my dad divorced 2 years ago and she had been dating the same man for about a year and a half of that time. They formally broke up about 2 months ago, when she met her current boyfriend. For the past month her current boyfriend has spent 3-4 days at our house every week. This started immediately after the rest of the house met him. 

I suffer from cptsd resulting from a decade of childhood trauma and neglect. I have expressed to my mother several times that I think it is inappropriate to allow him to stay as often as he does. Since he is practically a stranger to me this triggers some pretty life disrupting psychosomatic symptoms. Insomnia, panic attacks, nightmares, and an inability to move my body in the worst moments. She dismisses me and tells me that I am over reacting, but I no longer feel like my home of 2 years is a safe place. She avoids the conversation and threatens me when I bring up the issue. I can't afford the rent anywhere else. This man makes 3/4th of the house uncomfortable. WIBTA if I take legal action?",1
"I, m36, have recently became single and she kicked me out of the house because the house belonged to her and she paid for it.

I currently don’t have a job so couldn’t pay for a deposit to rent a flat. I asked my sister, Janet (f32) if I be could move in with her temporarily.

She wasn’t happy at first but after our mum spoke to her, she agreed. The issue is, she only gave me the couch and not a bedroom. She lives alone, in a 3 bed flat. The issue is, she converted 2 of her bedrooms into her offices because she runs a business from home. She had her computers in one room and stuff she’s selling in another.

Frankly, I think it’s excessive so I asked her to combine the rooms and allow me to have some privacy and my own bedroom. I even offered to move everything on my own so she wouldn’t have to carry heavy things. 

She refused. I told her she’s always been spoiled and didn’t need 3 rooms for herself.

She said it’s her house and I can sleep on the couch or go to mum’s (which she knows I won’t do). 

I told her she’s an asshole and a selfish prick. I though I could get to her and have been asking everyday but instead of finally agreeing, she threatened to kick me out of the house.

My mum is on my side but my dad and sister think I’m the asshole. I think she is because she doesn’t have any compassion.

I told my mates and they’re kind of split so I need stranger’s unbiased opinion before knowing how I’m going to proceed. Am I the asshole?",1
"About a week ago, I (22f) spent 4-5 days at my grandparents (84f and 73m) house while they were away.

I had messaged my Grandmother's partner (who we all consider to be more or less family), asking if it would be alright to use the space while they were gone.

In the message I explained that i wanted to be close to my friend who was diagnosed with appendicitis the night before, in case she needed anything--my thought was that since both her folks were very busy at the time, it would be easy to care for her if needed as she lives in a nearby neighborhood.

In any case, i automatically assumed it would be okay and just went, he never responded and i didn't think to check if he did the entire time i was there. I guess I figured it was my Grandmother's house too so it must be fine, and i had stayed there once before in the summer.

I slept on their couch and mostly sat at the kitchen table working, drawing, watching videos, etc. I made sure everything had been cleaned and replaced any food I used--mostly eggs and some frozen food. I decided to also leave some little extra things like fresh fruit and a loaf of bread. 

I left with no intention of hiding the fact that i was there.

After they came home they called my dad (her son) and gave him the brunt of it. My dad left the room to speak to them, I eventually asked if everything was OK. Her partner was notably angry, I picked up the phone and he would not let me try and apologize. 


I was really humiliated and spent the next several hours in tears thinking about what I'd done. I could only imagine how spooked they must've been, coming home, only to learn that someone was in their house.


My Grandmother just wanted to get over it, it seemed. Her and I message semi frequently over facebook and she thanked me for leaving the fresh bread. I responded saying I sincerely apologize for overstepping their boundaries.

Am I the asshole?",1
"My (29m) wife (27f) and I welcomed our first child into the world about 10 months ago. His paternal grandparents (my parents) live several states away, but he has two maternal aunts and uncles (their husbands) by marriage as well as a set of maternal grandparents. He also has my sister (26f) as an aunt. My sister is a bit of rebel who swears she'll never get married or have kids, and who claims to not even like kids.

When my son was born, though, I remember my sister coming to visit him in the hospital which actually somewhat surprised me, but when she saw her nephew she said ""I don't like kids, but he's so cute that he's an exception. He's officially my favorite kid on the Planet. Don't ever ask me to babysit, though.""

Well, I never would have dreamed of asking her since he had two willing grandparents as well as two willing aunts. However, recently the perfect storm happened.

My wife works in a jail and as such is considered an ""essential employee."" In other words; they can order her in to work if they're short and she doesn't have a right to refuse, no matter what is happening. It honestly doesn't come up very often at all, but when it does it does. Meanwhile I work as a kitchen manager/head chef at an event hall. I had a huge event that I absolutely couldn't miss on a day last week when it just so happened that my wife got ordered into work. Our contigency plan just in case just that sort of thing should happen to occur was to have one of her sisters or her parents watch our son. However they just so happened to all be out of town together that day, so I had no choice but to ask \*my\* sister to just watch her nephew for a few hours until one or both of us were able to get away from our jobs. But she refused.

I begged and pleaded with her but she just wouldn't do it, reminding us both that she told us that she said she would never babysit and that our emergency wasn't her problem. Finally my wife ended up having to tell her employer ""Well, I just can't come in. Do what you have to in terms of discipline"" which ended with her being receiving a written reprimand.

I ended up going off on my sister, telling her that she was selfish, amoral, etc. My sister said ""I don't owe you or your wife anything just because we're related"" but I told her that this was a horrible attitude, that she should have a better sense of loyalty to her family just because that's the right thing to do whether she'd ever ""agreed"" to anything or not.

"I (34m) am a physics PhD student here in Canada. My next-door apartment neighbor is a 27-year-old man who lives by himself. Before the year 2022, I had no problems with him. But sometime in that year, he began engaging in two annoying habits: one, repeatedly closing and opening his door, and two, playing the guitar incessantly. Every now and then, I bang on the wall between our apartments to tell him to shut up, and to his credit, he does quiet down whenever I do this. It's infuriating, and it disturbs my studies.

A few nights ago, my neighbor knocked on my door and offered me some chocolate and soda. He sheepishly let me know that ever since the pandemic, he has been struggling hugely with drugs and severe OCD. He told me that while he is still not entirely sober, he's doing his best, and that on the bright side, his OCD is improving. And I totally get that people struggle. I felt bad for him. But I politely turned down his gifts, and I kindly told him to enjoy the chocolate and drink for himself. When he insisted that I take his gifts, I more-or-less told him that he was being weird, and to never knock on my door again. Then I closed the door on him.

"I'll preface this by saying that my husband (Luke) M32 does not get along with my parents. You can't tell who's right or who's wrong, there's always this ongoing tension between them but can be civil enough to sit together at one table.


I recently got an invitation for christmas celebration from my parents. The invitation including me and Luke but Luke thought this was somewhat rude and a disrespectful because he believes he should get his own invitation and not have his name mentioned as an ""extention"" to mine. We talked and he said he wouldn't go unless they send him a proper invitation. I called mom and asked if she could do it. She thought it was ridiculous and said that she and dad did the same with my sister and her husband. I told her it was fine but Luke can be sensitive like that and so a simple invitation in a form of a text directly to him will fix it. She got defensive and said that Luke is being ridiculous. Dad claimed that Luke is trying to pull some power move to humiliate them but I thought this was a small issue. They still thought it was ridiculous so I told them I won't attend if they don't send him a separate invitation because he won't attend if he doesn't get it. This blew up and my sister started arguing saying Luke needs to get over himself and shamed me for trying to ""force"" our parents to send him an invitation by saying I won't come if they don't.


We haven't talked after that and we're waiting as of now.


edit! The invitation I recieved was in a text. Luke is saying that a simple text to him will finish the conflict but my parents still think it's ridiculous and that they won't invite him since they already have.


**UPDATE! I just got off the phone with my sister. She told me our parents have just disinvited me (Luke was probably already disinvited since the argument occured) from the celebration. I feel horrible but I can't argue anymore, just like I can't argue about what everybody else in the comments is saying. I admit it! Luke is the problem. He just caused me to be disinvited from the event and is blaming ME for it.**",1
"My (21M) brother (19M) and his girlfriend (20F) recently had a baby and they're currently staying at her mom's place because she wanted her mom by her side.  

Given their age, they are college students. My brother is in a civil engineering program, and she's in economics. I mention their course but it's the reason why I suggested my, possibly, future SIL to take a gap year/s to take care of her son. My reason is that she's in a four-years program while my brother's in five, and if she takes a gap, she can nurture their son and still graduate together with my brother.

But she doesn't want that. She assured me that her department doesn't take attendants seriously, so she can just submit assignments and projects and later, take the exams, all while taking care of their child. Plus, our parents and her mom would be helping them out. 

I highly doubt it is possible to study with a newborn and to expect others to take care of their kid while they run about daily is inappropriate. 

And I told her exactly that. She can't leave her newborn child with someone else, while she goes out to do something else. Will she still do the same if they have another kid? 

She got angry and called me rude for assuming that she couldn't take care of her son. (but, she can't. She's asking the grandparents to be parents. Her mom is literally taking care of him now). 

My brother liked the idea of taking a gap, but because of his gf he's calling me an asshole for interfering with their decisions. Even though he had agreed with me before. 

He demanded that I apologize to his gf for implying that she'd be a bad mom. My parents are on my side, and they suggested they reconsider their decision. I was told that I should let it be, and I have apologized to him. My brother has yet to accept it, despite demanding one, and we're still in a disagreement. 

AITA here",1
"Yesterday I was driving to school and I ran out of gas in the middle of the road—basically my car just stalled. I knew I needed gas on Monday but I just kept forgetting to stop.

I also forgot my phone and I had no idea what I was going to do so honestly my reaction to stressful situations is just to cry to clear my head so I can think. I guess I didn’t realize that because I was in the middle lane I caused a pretty big backup and that made me more stressed and more crying because I didn’t know how I would get out of the predicament.

These really nice guys in a construction truck pulled up next to me and asked if I needed help. I said yes…not only did the push my car out, they also gave me a ride to the gas station and even paid for my gas and the little tank thingy and then gave me a ride back and then even followed me to the gas station to make sure I made it safely—they were literally the nicest group of guys I’d ever met…the refused to take any money or let me buy them lunch or anything.

When I told my brother about what happened he said I had a long line of making stupid decisions but I can’t be this big of an Asshole to get in a car with strange men. I said this is his natural negativity when I’m positive. He said if our dad finds out about this he’s going to be pissed and I was ignorant for putting myself at “risk” and an Asshole.

"I do not have any legal rights to my son Danny. This is just a fucked up situation. 

I never wanted kids. Met a woman who felt the same until we got pregnant. Three kinds of birth control failed. I have since gotten snipped. 

I agreed to sign away my paternal rights and pay child support until he was adopted by her partner. Whomever that might be in the fullness of time. 

My parents insisted on being involved in his life. I was fine with it. He is a good kid most of the time. 

Unfortunately life or in this case death happens. My ex passed away. She has no family and she left Danny with my parents  when he was twelve. 

My parents are old as F and are a huge reason why I never wanted a kid. Danny's mom was an okay parent but pretty lenient. Going from that to my parents perfectly curated house must have been a shock. He was okay for a while. He is in counseling. He is fourteen now and as much of a pain in the ass as you can imagine a fourteen year old boy to be. 

Six months ago my parents threw in the towel. They said that if I didn't come take him he would be going to military school. I fucking hated military school so I took him in. All legal. My parents are his legal guardians but I am letting him live with me and trying to socialize him. 

He isn't having it. He has trashed my home a couple of times. He refuses to do his chores or his schoolwork. He is just being a dick. I have been going to counseling with him for six months and it hasn't helped. 

I sat him down and told him flat out that if I had to deal with him wrecking my stuff, not cleaning up after himself, or not doing his homework I was going to talk to my parents and see if perhaps being under professional care will help his behavior. 

He said I was an asshole and that I was never a father so why am I trying now. To be honest I'm trying because I loved his mom. I know she grew up in foster care and would hate knowing that's where he ended up.",1
"I had a birthday a few months, and I told my girlfriend to not get me anything. I didn't want or need anything. That this wasn't a secret challenge to find something I would like. I genuinely did not want any gifts.

Of course she gets me some gifts. And I hate them. She got me junk and a responsibility. Two things I don't want more of in my life.

She got me this crappy little plastic egg cooker thing. She knows I make hard boiled eggs in the pressure cooker, and I have expressed before that they come out perfect every time and that I love it. So I don't need some piece of junk as-seen-on-tv replacement. 

She also got me a small cactus. Which I see as nothing more than a responsibility that I don't want. I know cacti are pretty low maintenance, but I just don't care for them, and I have nowhere to put it, and I have a cat who likes to rub on things and push them over. It was a mess waiting to happen, which causes anxiety in me. And the only place to put it was in this one window in my tiny apartment where the curtain always drawn, so it's not like I ever see the damn thing.

So I threw it all away. After a few months these things sitting unused and unenjoyed just being useless clutter and wastes of money.

And now she's mad and has been very distant lately. She said that it was the thought that counted. But I told her that it didn't seem like any thought was put into these gifts.

I realize I'm a hard person shop for, and that's why I expressly don't want anyone getting anything for me. I am very picky.",1
"Hello everyone, in a bit of a bind at the minute regarding the wife and some visitors.

My wife (31F) and I (36M) have been married for 2 years now)  and she has a very regimented wellness/mindfulness routine. She wakes up at 5am, does yoga in the spare room, goes on a quick run and comes home to make a smoothie using one of those loud nutri-ninja blenders and will get on with her day. She also meditates in there, journals and does other things that I can't disrupt her because its her personal time. She was like this before I met her and was clear that if I wasn't on board with this aspect of her routine, she doesn't want to pursue anything with me. While I am not thrilled she has that whole room for herself (I did ask if I could put my PC in there so it's not in the dining room space), it was there before I moved in with her so I made my peace with it.

My sister is coming into town with her partner and young daughter (6F). We both agreed on letting them stay with us to save money. My wife wants them to sleep in the living room because we have multiple comfortable sofas for them to sleep on. While there is enough room, I made my case for buying air matresses for them and to set them up in my wife's spare room. I also asked her if she would part with her smoothie making at least until they wake up so they aren't disturbed in the morning.

My wife is vehemently opposed to giving up her room and smoothies. She doesn't think the room will be comfortable for them (no carpets and its got huge windows and massive mirrors on one wall) and that I'm using this situation as a way to disrupt her routine I apparently hate. I'm not sure where she got that from since I've never asked her to change it. We're in a disagreement over where they should stay and my wife is event threatening to not allow them to stay and have them get a hotel for the visit. AITA? I don't think giving up the room is that hard an ask for my family's comfort and it's only 3 days.

ETA - Thank you for all the advice everyone, I am heading to bed now. I have decided not to push this issue any further with my wife and my sister and family can use the sofas or I will pay partly for a hotel for them. I do plan on asking my wife about her routine and can update if people would like me to.

Final update - Wife was making a smoothie this morning and I approached her over her smoothie making to clear the air. I said that I was wrong to ask to use the room for them and my sister and family should sleep on the sofas and she was happy to let them stay. I also asked why she has the rigidity of her routine. We didn't get into all of it but it was a start. I know my wife had a difficult upbringing in her teenage years but did not link the two that her routine was born out of those circumstances. I will not be encroaching on her room anymore and someone commented I could add heating to my garage so I could place my gaming PC in there which is a great plan. Thanks all.",1
"I \[33M\] have recently purchased and run a high-end bar. I want the venue to maintain a certain standard and image and therefore require my staff to wear professional work attire as the uniform. As with professional attire for most fields, this includes female staff wearing makeup. This is the image of my bar that I want my guests to experience. I see no issues with this, and when I worked hospitality when I was in my early 20's, female staff were always required to wear makeup, no dramas. I clearly communicate the acceptable uniform to my staff through the style guide I provide every few months. 

""Lisa"" \[22F\] has decided that because she studied a woman's course at uni she's now more 'woke' than us and has made an issue over me requiring the female staff to wear makeup and not the guys. This is quite laughable to me because obviously guys don't wear makeup for a professional uniform. Lisa on Friday night refused to wear makeup to her shift, and I had to send her home on a busy Friday night. She said it isn't fair that I have such a strict emphasis on the female uniform when the male uniform is a lot less effort – and that it's 'discriminatory'. She also said if I want the girls to spend an hour doing a full face of makeup then I can pay the girls for an extra hour and the products. I laughed in her face and told her my uniform does not differ from professional attire in any industry and it's standard for woman to wear makeup in professional environments. Furthermore, I am the owner/manager and can choose the attire my staff wear for the bar's look that I want. She said her wearing makeup does not compromise her ability to bartend and actually looks less professional when she's sweating in makeup. I told her there are bars in our city that literally have females serving in lingerie or hostesses dolled up to the 10's, and you're having a whinge about dressing professionally. Have you ever been to Vegas? Do you think those girls working hostess jobs in hospitality don't have to look a certain way for that role? I sent her home.

I was going to fire her if she did a repeat of this on Saturday, but she'd gotten all the girls to wear no makeup, and now none of them will work until I change the rules. I do need to see if I am the AH here because it's Christmas, summer, and I'm short staffed.",1
"My GF is self employed and in the past week she has been stressed. She said she wanted to talk and so when I was driving her home, she started to open up.

She said she feels like she's drowning with paying her mortgage, handling clients, and the stress of being self employed. She's also taking an expensive course online to help some of her marketing skills.

I told her ""we just have to toughen up"" for her mortgage. She said her course work is demanding but I reminded her it's only 2 hours of lesson time a week.

She blew up and started crying and says she ""has nobody to talk to.""

She's upset because she bought a contract from a website and I didn't offer to look it over. I'm a lawyer but legally I can't give her legal advice.

I dropped her off when she was crying and went to lunch without texting her, and again she's upset.

So reddit, AITA?",1
"***TLDR: My Mom was nicknamed as “Mommy Dearest.” She found out & got incredibly angry. I apologized & deleted it.***

**Relevant backstory:** I love my Mother very much, we have always had a rough relationship, she has some serious childhood trauma that affects her to this day. It took me a long time to realize what had happened to her when she was very young & how deeply it affects her daily life. She has a lot of insecurities & anger.

**Story:** Saturday afternoon I was picking up my Niece to have sleepover at my place. While there, my Mom had lost her phone & asked me to call it. I pulled out my phone & said “Hey Siri, call ‘Mommy Dearest’. “ 

I didn’t think much of it and went on to have a fun time.

The following night my Mom picked her up & I joined to go over to borrow my Sister’s car. As we are riding in the car talking I asked my Mom how her day was at work followed by sharing all the things we did together. Out of nowhere/irrelevant to the conversation my Mom asks “Why do you have me in your phone as ‘Mommy Dearest’ ?” She had an angry/accusatory tone.

I was taken aback by the sudden turn, I knew it had probably been bothering her a while. I asked her how it made her feel. She kind of shut down. More directly I then asked if she found it insulting. She said yes. I told her one of my friends had done this & I thought it was cute so I did it too.

I let her know I didn’t intend to hurt her feelings or make her angry. I then apologized & deleted it from my phone that moment. 

I stepped away for a bit. She was a little icy the rest of the night & I gave her some space, she seemed fine later.

**AITA?** I feel like this is an overreaction on her part & just an example of how this trauma some 50+ years affects her daily life & relationships. No family is “normal.” I do feel frustrated that this was something I’ve had to put together on my own.

In the past few years I have been demonized by her siblings for trying to find ways for her to heal & address what actually happened. 

Aside from my Aunt who was a victim of the same trauma, everyone else just gaslights me. They are adamant that nothing ever happened and have all pushed me away. 

**Also, AITA for wanting to address this to help her heal?** I just want her to be the amazing Mother/Grandma I know her to be. My Niece is growing up living with her. 

My Mom blown up at my Niece and Sister for other similarly minor things. They have had to come over to my house at midnight to get away from my Mom’s rage and destructive outbursts. 

I love my Mom, but I do feel the need for feedback. I mean, in a family where everyone is against one person, indeed; that person is often the asshole. I just feel like they are boomers who will refuse to understand the importance of mental health and will continue to sweep it all under the rug. I just want to help her to find ways to heal if even in a small way for the benefit of all involved, most especially her.",1
"My wife (37f) and I (38m) have 3 kids, 12, 10, and 8. She is in a constant state of overwhelm and very easily irritated, constantly complaining how it's all too much. I'm of course happy to help and do my fair share for the kids or household, but it's never enough because her standards are too damn high. 

She insists one of us has to be up at 6:45 every morning to make sure the kids are ready and make the bus which comes at 7:45. I told her they're old enough to not need that much help already. They can all dress themselves and pour themselves cereal and milk, there's no reason we have to be up. She says that cereal isn't a good enough breakfast, they need something more substantial, especially the 12 year old, and that the 10 year old has adhd and will definitely struggle without help in the morning and anyway she wants to see them off and kiss them goodbye for the day. So she gets up, I don't, then she gets upset that I never give her a morning off when all she needs to do is just take the morning off when she wants and let the kids handle themselves. 

Also she is super strict about screen time during the week and is exhausted and snappy from arguing about it with the kids and upset i don't support her strict limit of 2 hours a day. I say as long as homework is done, why not until bed. She says it's not healthy for them, they need to play outside or with games and toys, read some books, just entertain themselves in more ways than 1. I agree they should enjoy other things but not seeing why we have to make such a rigid limit. She also likes to get out on weekends and do stuff like zoos, museums etc, but then complains about the planning for the outing and how grouchy the youngest gets by the end of it, and again, I say let's just chill at home and voila, you've cut the work! 

I'm an engaged and active parent, I'm not trying to get out of it, but I don't think I should have to help my wife dig herself out of her own self created holes. She creates the stress for herself and then turns to me to alleviate it which I think is unfair. AITA for telling her she needs to do less and then she won't need this level of help?",1
"About a year ago I pulled a prank on my sister. It was the classic bucket-over-the-door prank where I filled up a cup of water and placed it over her bedroom door. 

This is the part where I screwed up. I honestly forgot she had prom that day. So she came home with two of her friends, all 3 of them already dressed up. As she went into her room the cup fell on her and she got water all over her dress. 

I’m kinda the prankster of the family so she knew right away I set the cup up. So she bursted into my room screaming at me. That’s when I realized that she had prom and I fucked up. She was yelling at how I’m a huge asshole, a shitty brother, all kinds of stuff, while her friends joined her in berating me. I guess it didn’t help that her prom date was coming pretty soon and she didn’t have time to dry up. She basically felt humiliated.

I won’t lie. I’m definitely am the asshole for that. At that time I probably put a huge stinker on what should’ve been one of her highlights in High School. However, idk about what happened afterwards.

I tried talking to her the next day to apologize, but she completely brushed me off, giving me the silent treatment. After a couple of days, I finally got her to talk to me. When I apologized, she told me, in her words, “Shut up. I don’t accept your apology, you’ve ruined Prom for me and I’m an embarrassment to everyone now”, and that in of itself turned into an hour long rant of her berating me.

I still felt horrible about it, and I get why she doesn’t want to accept my apology. But if I screw up and people don’t want to forgive, I’ll reserve them that right and not waste the energy trying to apologize to them. So that’s what I did with her. We both didn’t bring it up. And for about a year things went normal, though I felt our relationship changed a bit as we didn’t talk much anymore. 

She eventually graduated High School and went on to college next fall.  One night  right around Christmas Break, I got a text from one her friends that were there when the prank happened. They both go to the same college. It was basically a drunk rant about how huge of an asshole I am. 

My sister didn’t say anything to me about the incident but I guess she vented out to her friend about how I’m an inconsiderate piece of crap. About how I didn’t even try to make amends. 

So I’m confused. My sister would not forgive me,  but is upset that I didn’t do what she didn’t want? AITA for not trying to apologize to my mister when she didn’t want an apology?",1
"When I told my wife that my parents prefer to not spend money on traveling for tourism (because they own only one apartment, both are employees working in middle-class jobs in a country that has an economic crisis), my wife said that “her parents too, prefer not to spend money to save for their retirement (noting that they are already retired and are living in a very good country, own several properties, consisting of at least 1 building they are renting, two apartments they are renting,  a shop shop they are renting, a piece of land, and 3 apartments in an area with high rent, two of them rented, in a touristic area of another country). I then told her that she seems detached from reality. She considered what I said offensive. AITA?

Important background info:

Last year, we travelled abroad with her mother(to take care of our baby when we wanted to go out at night), and I asked her then to make her mother pay for the ticket and hotel and for her expenses, she didn’t like that, because she considered that we have to pay for her mom’s trip and expenses since she is doing us a favor. I was not very financially comfortable back then, and also I did not think that her mother “needed” our help with the expenses, so I did not accept to be covering her expenses during that trip then.

Today (1 year later), I suggested to her that I’m thinking to pay for a budget vacation trip for my parents (around 600$ in total) so that they meet us in a country abroad (we live in a other country than them), and to also have them help us with our toddler during the nights so that we can go out alone.

"I (39M) have a son (17 M) who recently got a girlfriend. His girlfriend is black and a very nice, kind and beautiful young lady. I have met her and invited her for dinner and family events plenty of times and she’s a joy to be around. But recently my mother has been staying with us because she  is recovering from a surgery she had and she’s going on 70 years old so she can’t do much on her own. Long story short my mother is a classic racist and being a raging narcissist and she is not one to hold back from her opinions. I showed her a photo of my son and his girlfriend and she went on a 2 hour rant about bloodlines and kept saying they “don’t look right” and when I said she was coming to dinner she said doesn’t want the girl near her because it’ll “disturb her” so last minute I told her she could not come. My son has been trying to invite his girlfriend over everyday since but I said no multiple times due to his grandmother being here and her saying she doesn’t want her near her, I just don’t want any problems. But he argues that I am being “a complacent racist” by even allowing her to be here. And even more so for not allowing her to come over to “protect a racist”. He says I should of told her to leave the moment my mother said all that stuff. But my mother is an elderly woman who can hardly make it on her own as it is. Definitely much harder after surgery. Though I don’t agree with her I can just leave her to fend for herself. I literally do not know what to do. My wife says my son is right about me being complacent but of course she’d agree because her and my mother don’t get along well. I know I am not a damned racist. But now everyone is saying I am aiding one by taking my mothers side. So AITA?

Edit: Hello everyone last night I posted this after me and my son argued over this all day and my wife is giving me the silent treatment. I can really reply to anyone because the moderators locked this post. I woke up this morning with thousands of notifications. I just posted this thinking maybe 20 people would reply. The messages and comments are overwhelming. But I will answer everything as best as I can. Firstly no I can not afford to put my mother in a home. I’m not rich and I’m not poor but I do have 3 children I need to provide for and my wife. The savings I have I won’t spend on anything but their college funds. And my mother definitely doesn’t have the money to afford those homes. She lives by herself, with me and younger my sister occasionally going over a few times a week to help her. This situation is just special because she had benign tumor removed. If I could of I would have had her stay with my sister but my sister is pregnant and very soon to go into labor. So I offered her to stay. She is a difficult person to be around but she’s my mother and she’s still has about 7 more weeks until she’s able to go back to being on her own. Second, I have no problem with my sons girlfriend. I actually would be happy if he chose to settle down with her in the future. I want to welcome her in my home. She had been coming over and basically apart of the family for months now up until this. And now my son says she thinks we don’t want her around anymore. I can see why people are saying I am the asshole after reading through I still am unsure how to go about this still. People are saying I should invite her over and tell my mom that she will not say anything out of the norm to her or else I’ll send her off. But people are also saying I should not bring her over knowing it’s a possibility that my mother will do something anyway. Kicking my mother to curb for now is not an option but I will privately tell his girlfriend the situation and ask her what she would like to do and make arrangements from there. Also people are calling my son an AH for wanting her to come over because of this. I am okay with being criticized on here but please do not shame my son. I think he is just getting anxious because him and her don’t go to the same school and the only way they see each other at my house because my son says her father is very overprotective and intimidates him every time he goes to her house. I do understand I was going about this in a very easy way by just doing what my mother says for the time being because I did not want to start drama. But she is the bad guy in the situation and she is the one who needs to change and I should not be accommodating her prejudice ways and my son or his girlfriend should not have to suffer because of her. 

Thanks for all the advice.",1
"So my situation is a little difficult so I thought I would confide in the good professional people of reddit. Couple days ago me and my brother we’re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven’t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what’s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the “secrets” I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying “Just don’t let mom find out” The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out “I cheated on my wife...” At first it didn’t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife’s travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They’ve both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) 
He told me life has been good to him now and he’s just thankful things have finally worked out. 

As stated before I hate cheaters and I’ve always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it’s the right thing to do, especially because I’ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it’s none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don’t want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don’t say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something?

TLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I feel obligated to tell his wife because she’s a close friend. WIBTA?

Edit: I’m referring SIL as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are Very close lol. I thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just SIL, but it looks like I was wrong.

Second Edit: Wow this is on the front page, I never intended nor expected this blow up as it did! I’m sorry I can’t reply to everyone, but there will be some kind of update.",1
"My girlfriend and I have been together for five years, truthfully our relationship is great we rarely argue about anything. The only consistent argument in our relationship is about her sleeping habits. Important for context, she isn’t lazy - she has a busy job, busy social life, goes to the gym, and we often do things together. 

My issue is we regularly disagree with her sleeping pattern, when we were at university it was fine. Now it’s just bizarre. Here are some examples
- She goes to bed around 11pm gets up at 7am (normal amount of sleep)
- Any journey (plane, car journey, train if she is not travelling alone) she will have a ‘quick nap’ regardless of how long the journey is she will sleep most of it. 
- Regularly returns from work and has a nap for an hour 
- Works from home two days a week and uses her lunch hour to sleep 
- Gets up very late every weekend regardless of what time she’s gone to sleep, and will regularly also nap 

I understand she may be tired, and I have understood this over the years. My AITA is that this has been bothering me for some time which I have mentioned. Yesterday we returned home from a trip away (I do all the driving as she only drives roads she knows, I also don’t mind). It was a 6hr journey I’d also made on Friday. I asked her to please not sleep the entire time as it would be good to chat etc. 5 mins in, she is asleep. I woke her up when we arrived home. She apologies for sleeping, I called her selfish AITA?",1
"I 19F dropped out of university in my first year (I should've been in my second right now) due to severe mental health issues. My anxiety and depression intertwine and I couldnt handle it so I isolated myself and I'm currently dealing with it at therapy and it's a struggle for me even to do basic things like I used to. But when I do overcome those milestones I'm very proud of myself. I always feel behind in life socially and on the education side too but Its a process to get better mentally, obviously and naturally I wanted to prioritise getting better before anything. My parents are ethnic so the disappointment was obvious when I dropped out but they are on the less strict side and still support me and sometimes take me to therapy. My mum sometimes brings up slowly how I shouldn't fall behind in life, all the time. 

In a general conversation she was having with me and my family, she mentioned this neighbour (that's my same age) dropped her mum home by car while my mother was talking to someone on the patio. My dad replied oh she drives in a slightly proud way. They always subtly hint things like this. And I lashed out saying is this a necessary detail? And she first said I was just saying what I saw. And then I started saying it isn't a big deal that she drives and who care and some mean things out of frustration . Then she said you sound jealous and she said translated to English we don't put pressure on you and just because you don't want to anything don't get angry of me bringing up other people. I flipped even more. I told her that she's doing it on purpose and she got mad at me. She later told me she sees kids my age progressing and she day in day out wishes that for me. 

In this post I'm mostly favouring my mum as I learnt that my anxiety and depression makes me think everyone's against me. My parents would literally pay all my driving lessons and buy me a car. But I know that isn't right so I'm trying to get my mental health sorted. 


Edit: by ethnic I meant ethnic minority so they tend to uphold reputation and education. ",1
"Throwaway account. All names are fake but the frustration is real.

Currently trying to figure out how to get SOMEONE to look at this living situation.But not sure if this is an asshole thing to do…

My family has been caring for my sister (Maria) and her two girls since these girls were born just over a decade ago. Maria had these girls with Fred, who cheated on Maria when the girls were very young. Shortly after that, Maria found out she has a pretty serious illness and her quality of life is deteriorating every year.

Despite the cheating and the illness, Maria is desperately in love with Fred. Always has been. Can’t accept anyone’s help if it means letting go of the hope of Fred. My family has drained massive resources trying to help, guide and care for Maria and the girls but every time she gets an itch up her ass or Fred bats an eyelash, she’s gone. Girls thrown in a tailspin. Quiet chaos for months until the shit falls apart like wet cookies and we have to come in and stabilize everything again. This has happened four times.

Until this last time. Without too many specifics, Maria picked a massive fight with our family, packed her bags and left! Still sorting that out but basically she now lives with Fred’s cousin/best friend in low-income housing deemed for folks with mental illness. When girls are with her, they all sleep on the floor. My family was floored but this time it was too much, Maria walking out and going to his family after all we did (incl. buying a duplex for us + Maria and the kids!) made everyone back off.

Fred has SEVEN kids, a grandkid, a slew of baby mamas, no car, a part-time(ish) job, no place of his own, and thinks he’s gonna be discovered “any day now” on “the socials”. He convinced Maria to take their kids out of school and let them go to a subpar school closer to him.

He currently lives with baby mama numero three (let’s call her Pamela) in her Section 8 apt with their three kiddos, Pamela’s older twins from a previous relationship + his daughters with Maria. Those two daughters are either sleeping in the dining room or in a room with three or five other minors.

I’m fed up. I need eyes on this situation. Lawyer says best options are to pray or call CPS, but that could trigger temp foster care. I know Fred’s scamming ass is living there but it’s Pamela’s Section 8. AITA if I inform the housing authority of this living situation? Pamela could be in jeopardy of losing her place but I’m beyond caring. Just want the two kids who didn’t ask for any of this to be home and be okay.

TL;DR: AITA for reporting family to Section 8 because minor girls are living with too many people, and dad is there illegally?",1
"I (F32) got a private text this morning from the mother of my son’s (M7) classmate. She told me that apparently my son has been calling her daughter’s traditional lunch weird and things as such and apparently that is making her daughter feel uncomfortable and insecure. She asked me to please talk to my son about being more sensitive and respectful so her daughter doesn’t feel excluded.

Now, I feel for this woman as a fellow mother. No one wants to see their child feeling sad, but overcoming insecurities is a big part of growing up. Additionally, I thought it was ridiculous of her to criticize my son, a 7 year old, for making relatively innocuous and curious comments about food that is not familiar to him. He’s at a curious age and is discovering the world, and I refuse to try and limit him and shut him down for not having the emotional sensitivity of an adult.

Politely, I told that mother that I was sorry her daughter was struggling with insecurities, and I found some online parenting articles about building your child’s confidence to send to her so she could use some tips to help her daughter out.

She replied and said I was acting completely shamelessly and disgracefully, and I am not able to text her anymore. AITA?",1
"My son (26) has been in a relationship for 4 years with his girlfriend (25). Her and I have never particularly gotten along but I’ve tried to be nice to keep the peace. I assumed from the beginning they would break up eventually as she isn’t my son’s usual type and seems very blunt and what I assume is gothic which my son has always disliked. However, they’ve managed to stay together this long and I haven’t overly commented on the fact because I understand he’s an adult who can make his own decisions, but I’m also an adult who can make mine. His girlfriend and I have never seen eye to eye, and my son says it’s my fault, of course because I’m his evil mother I guess! If you ask her a question, she gives you the most logical, unsugar-coated response. She doesn’t really talk to my side of the family but does talk to my husbands and my daughter who adores her. She doesn’t like kids and when I asked her about kids she told me as much, and I find this girl to be completely disrespectful with how quiet she is, how she acts strangely around my family at events, and how unaffectionate she is with people. My family is very talkative and affectionate and she is disinterested in creating that relationship. My son says she’s not affectionate with her own family and that my family has made it impossible for her to be close to because we have always treated her disrespectfully, which I don’t see. She seems to pick on my son, which I don’t appreciate, but he says is in good fun and is very common in her family to have a lighthearted go at each other. I said I found this entirely disrespectful and so she hasn’t done it in my presence again. My son has gone LC with me and for awhile even cut contact because he said I treat this girl so poorly. Now, he wants to propose to her and I just think it’s a bad idea. I don’t know what they have in common if anything, she’s cold and prickly, she hasn’t spoken to me or my family in months, and I think she’s manipulating him and taking him away from us. I told him this was a bad idea and I wasn’t going to hold my tongue anymore and he said he’s an adult and can do what he wants and he’s tired of how I act to her. I told him if he gets engaged to her I won’t speak to him again. My husband told me that this is an asshole thing to do and he has never seen why I can’t get along with her since she’s so nice. My daughter (28) feels the same way as my husband and told me I need to get it together and how I always put me and his girlfriend into situations where I know we’re going to buttheads and that I always “start” it over silly things. She said she’ll cut me off if I do this but I just want my son to be happy with someone who’s a nice person. AITA?",1
"Last fall, my husband and I went to my cousin's wedding in another state. 

In the months leading up to the wedding, my aunt (cousin's mother) griped about how unconventional the wedding was going to be. She was happy for the couple of course but she didn't like that the wedding wasn't going to be in a church or banquet hall. The wedding was going to be a small and intimate affair in a scenic national park and then the reception was going to be in a nice rental house in the woods. I thought it sounded cool and unique but my aunt hated the idea of it. She didn't tell the couple tho. Just complained about it to us behind their backs. 

We traveled 600 miles to the wedding. We treated the trip like a vacation. Spent some money on lodging, food, sightseeing, etcetera. 

The day before the wedding, my aunt rounded up me and my family members and told us that she just found out that the dress code for the wedding was casual. Not gonna lie, many of us were stoked. I hate dressing up so I was all over the idea of a casual backyard bbq wedding. 

My husband and I had already packed nice clothes so we wore them to the ceremony. A few of my family members showed up to the ceremony in t-shirts and baseball caps. Immediately after, we changed into comfortable clothes for the reception. I wore a hoodie, daisy Duke shorts and cute sandals. 

I noticed that the bride's family members were still dressed up but I figured they didn't get the memo. The bride and groom and the wedding party were dressed to the nine's which I thought was weird for a casual wedding. The reception was awesome. Nice dinner, fancy lawn games, a bonfire. We had a blast. 

So we just found out that the bride and groom were very upset with us for wearing casual clothes to their wedding. They thought it was very disrespectful. Apparently my aunt lied to us because she wanted to sabotage their wedding and they were upset that no one checked with them about the dress code. This explains why my cousin and his wife have been standoffish toward us since the wedding. 

TBH we think they're overreacting because we all had fun at their wedding and it's not our fault we got bad info about the dress code. And they never specified the dress code in the invitation. But I still have to ask. AITA?",1
"I recently moved into a new apartment building. As you exit the elevator, my neighbour's door is on the right, and mine on the left. We have one shared wall between our doors. There is a bare wall to the left of my door, and a wall to the right of my neighbour's door which they have panelled as an extension of their front door. This means they cannot hang any decorations on that wall.

When I moved in, the wall between our doors was a shrine. There was a large religious painting in the center, surrounded by religious adornments, and two tables under them also covered with religious adornments. I decided to be upfront and rang my neighbour's bell, introduced myself and explained I wasn't comfortable living with religious iconography outside my door. I spoke to the wife, who was home at the time, and she seemed genuinely nice. She explained my apartment had been vacant so no one minded, but she would move it if it made me more comfortable.

What has followed is six months of pure hell. Each time I spoke to her she said she would clear the wall, she just hadn't gotten around to it yet. After reminding her, at first gently and intermittently, and later less nicely and more frequently, she finally took down most of the religious adornments. The tables were the first to go (they were a fire hazard any way), then the other ornaments, and finally only the painting was left. It's very large, it's the first thing I see when I come home, and as a non-religious person it makes me angry that I am being forced to live with iconography outside my front door that does not represent who I am as a person.

Once it became clear she was not going to moving the painting, I escalated the matter to the building society, who at first sympathised with me, but later said they could not help. I have since found out my neighbour is on the board of the society, and obviously has some pull. After refusing to drop the matter, I have even been accused of stirring religious disharmony in the building, which I find ridiculous. One board member went so far as to say since it's a religious painting, I CAN'T ask her to take it down.

My friends are telling me that I'm overreacting and it's better to keep the peace. On some level, I understand that certain people feel the need to ""protect their home"" with religious iconography outside their door. But it's not my problem that they decided to panel the wall to the other side of their door, so they cannot use it to display their reverence.

Since the society won't help me, I am tempted to do something truly petty, like fill every available inch of wall space on BOTH sides of my door with images from ALL religions. Which abides with the unofficial building rule that we can't ask people to take down religious pictures.

I really can't tell if I'm justified in my anger, or I'm just being an asshole about this?

**EDIT:** I am not an atheist, nor have I at any time claimed to be one, so kindly stop attacking me about that. Since I apparently have to spell my beliefs out, I do believe in God but I am not a religious person. In fact the amount of suffering and violence perpetuated in the name of ""religion"" (and I'm speaking here both generally and from personal experience) make me incredibly uncomfortable around ANY over the top display of religious fervour. And yes, having an extremely large religious painting hanging outside my front door does fall into that category for me. And yes, I've had this conversation with my neighbour, several times, where she's said she sees where I'm coming from and agreed to move her stuff. But then just didn't. 

I'd also request people taking the time to respond to actually read the post instead of assuming things. No, my neighbour is not an ""old lady"", nor is she my ""roommate"". If you insist on assuming which religion I'm talking about, even though I've been clear about not specifying it, you're just making an ass out of you and...well...you. And just because I used the idiom ""pure hell"" does not make me sheltered, I've been through enough in my life, but if calling me sheltered makes you feel superior and helps you sleep at night, go for it.

I'm done reading replies because the majority of people replying are more interested making up stories in their heads and calling me names (everything from dick and moronic baby to edge lord...that last one had my colleagues cracking up). Will post pictures of my flying spaghetti monster once I put it up. It will be put up on my own wall though, because (a) contrary to the names people are calling me here, I'm not an evil human being (though I can be petty sometimes...never claimed I was perfect) and (b) there's no space on the ""shared wall"" anyway.

Have a good one! And thank you to the kind stranger for the silver :)",1
"My (34F) daughter (12F) has been acting uncooperative in the context of the planning process for my wedding. I have been engaged for almost six months and the wedding is happening in eight so this was the moment to start the selection of the Bridesmaid Dresses. My daughter said she didn't want to wear a dress like that I was fine with that. I feel that having a junior bridesmaid is not really a necessity anyway so she could still be part of my day from a more flexible role but then she said she didn't want to were any kind of dress. I still thought that was valid, maybe she could have wear a suit or something else.

The issue was that she ended up saying she wouldn't wear anything expensive or formal to the wedding because she feels that kind of clothing does not represents her individuality not just from a gender perspective but also from a cultural and social point of view. She says she will only accept coming if she can wear the following outfit. A Manchester City's shirt, a long black pleated skirt and black leather sandals with 3 cm heels.

I tell her it would be better if she didn't come then but she says if she isn't at the wedding she won't recognize our marriage and still consider me to be single. We have been arguing about this a lot but she doesn not changes her mind. My fiance (41M) feels we should let her come to the wedding dress in any way she wants and that it is not a big deal. I feel that she is acting crazy and we should not reward her for it.

Am I the Asshole?",1
"I, f33 was at work when I got a feeling that my son, m5, was in trouble. I called my sons school and found out the principal wasn't there that day, I asked the vice principal if there was a little boy in the office, she said yes, I asked ""is it james"" she said yes. So I hung up the phone and drove to my son's school only to find out that my son had been sitting in the office all day from 9:00 am to 1:30 pm! My son is in kindergarten and when this happened it was a very hot day out and my sons class was outside the whole day. Because my son is in kindergarten he didn't know he had to ask to go inside and get water. Because he went inside without permission the teacher sent him to the office for the whole day! Then I find out that the only reason my son ate lunch that day is because of a teacher that doesn't even teach him! The people who work in the office had no intention on feeding him!! When I found thus out I went to the playground and started yelling at the vice principal for this.

So AITA for yelling in my sons vice principals face?",1
"Throwaway account for privacy. I had to repost, because my first post was stopped. Made a few edits.

I (71 female) have a son (39 male ) whose wife (36 female) gave birth to their fourth child nine months ago. All of her births have taken a long time, and she has been induced the last two times, including this one.

My husband (72 male) and I were babysitting the three older kids (5 male, 4 female and 2 female). She was induced at eight in the morning, and by one in the afternoon, there was not much progress, if any at all. Since the kids are a handfull, I told my son he needed to come home to help for a few hours, since it looked like it would take a really long time.

Since they live half an hour away from the hospital, he could go back if anything happened, so it is not like he wouldn’t be present when the child was born, which I ofcourse understand is a big moment for him and his wife.

My son took great offense to my request and told me to suck it up, bribe the kids with treats or whatever worked for us, and that there was no way he would leave his wife’s side, unless there was an emergency with one of the kids, like they were admitted to the hospital or something.

I told him that the kids were their responsibility, and that they couldn’t expect us to babysit around the clock if this took days. He told me we should not have said yes to babysit at all if we wouldn’t stick it out, since one never knows how long a birth will take, but that he would get someone to come and then he hung up. Three hours later someone showed up and we went home.

We offered to babysit for a few hours the next day, but our offer was declined, because the people who came to relieve us, stayed until the baby was born and my son came home.

After this they have not asked us to babysit once and has hired a sitter instead, which we feel is a waste of money, since we are available for free. We get to see the grandkids if we visit them, but they very seldom visit us, compared to before.

I tried talking to both my son and DIL, but they said they felt we didn’t respect them at all since we wouldn’t “even let her give birth in peace”. My husband and I agree that they are overreacting, since she did not, in fact, give birth until seven the next morning, 23 hours after being induced, and our son could very easily have helped us with the kids for a few hours.

So AITA like my son says I am, for helping us with the kids, even if his wife was being induced, but had little to no progress?

  
EDIT: 1)This is my first ever post (had to repost and also delete one time, because I did it wrong apparently), 2) I have NOTHING to do with the woman making weird comments about autoimmune issues caused by a dog, 3) My DIL was NOT in active labor when I asked- they were walking around in the hospital, trying to get things started.  


Edit #2: 4) We were staying at their house.5) We only wanted some relief, we were planning to continue babysitting. Saying we only wanted to do 5h total is unfair.

"Throwaway account 

I (36 male) have a 16 year old daughter named Jane. Jane is a great kid and was really close to my mom until she passed away a year ago. My mother gave one piece of her jewelry to her children before she passed away. I was given her engagement ring. 

I have been planning a proposal to my girlfriend, Laura (30 female) for about 6 months now. Jane is from my previous relationship (her mother and I were never married). I’ve been dating Laura for about 5 years. 

I told Jane I was going to propose. She was happy about it and asked to see the ring. I told her I’d be using my mothers ring and Jane looked upset so I asked her what was wrong. She said she had assumed the ring would be hers since she is my daughter. I explained the ring was given to me and there are other heirlooms (small items like rosary beads) she can have. 

For clarification I do have the money to buy a ring but the sentimental value of this ring is why I wanted to use it. Laura also helped us take care of our mom while she was sick and they were close. 

I proposed to Laura with the ring and she said yes. After this happened Jane cried to her uncle (my brother) about it and he understands both points. His wife thinks I’m an AH so do some other family members. I obviously can’t take it back from Laura when I already proposed. 

AITA?

Edit: 

The ring was given to me not Jane. 

Laura has known my mother her whole life our mothers are best friends and have been hinting we should get married as long as I can remember.

Update: 

My daughter and brother decided to call my father to come to my house and talk to me. Laura was out to dinner with her friends. 

My daughter and brother explained to my father their thoughts on the situation. I stayed quiet while they explained their point so that my father could really hear what my daughter was saying and so I could also hear her out. My father is a marine veteran and very blunt. 

My father stopped them and said he’s heard enough. He said my mother would have wanted Laura to have the ring and Jane isn’t showing fhe maturity to receive an heirloom right now. He told her he’s disappointed in her entitlement and that she needed to get her attitude in check by his next visit. He also reminded everyone Laura’s been family for years even before we were together even if it’s not by blood. 

My daughter said yes sir and isn’t happy about the outcome but accepts my father saying this is what my mother wanted.

Final update: 

Since everyone wants to know Laura’s take here we go. I told Laura what was going on and that Jane is upset. I also told her the ring is hers now and she can decide who it is eventually passed down to. I know a lot of people won’t agree with this but it’s what I’m doing. 

We have a pre nup in the works for other properties we own. Laura suggested adding the ring just for secure minds and we agreed we would add that it would be given back to the family if we were to divorce. 

Laura will not be passing on the ring unless she passes away. That is my fathers request to her and she is honoring that. 

We have spoken to Jane and I have explained all of this. I’ve explained she’ll always be my daughter and that won’t change. She understands. She apologized to Laura and me for her behavior and explained she was just upset. Laura had a one on one talk with her as well about how she loves her and isn’t trying to replace anyone or change the family dynamic we have. Jane seems to feel better.

Update: 

Laura might be pregnant. Jane does know.

Update: 

The ring has been added to our will. We have decided to continue the tradition I started of the ring going to a son to give to his wife. If we do not have a son then the ring will go to a grandson or to my nephew. Since the ring will not be given to anyone until we pass we are not telling Jane that has been added to the will.",1
"I (26M) have had a rescue shelter dog ( Ravioli) for about 5 years. My long-term girlfriend (24F) splits time between living with me and her parents about 1.5 hr away. I am leaving on a work trip next week for about 40 days, so I was hoping to spend a good amount of time with her before I leave. I also have to do a lot of packing and stuff to do before leaving. I own my house and it is old, so it needs a bit of extra care before being left empty for that long. 

Her parents have a 2 year old pup/dog (Chester) that my gf absolutely adores (and who I love too). The issue arose when her parents planned to visit her brother out of state for the weekend. They asked my gf to stay at their house for the weekend to watch the dog Friday night-Sunday afternoon. My gf explained to them that she would rather stay with me to help me get all set to leave and spend time with me before we will be apart for more than a month. Her family has an elderly relative who lives nextdoor to the them, along with a live-in caretaker. She suggested that the caretaker watch Chester instead. However, Chester has never been alone at their house at night before, and so their parents didn’t feel comfortable with that, even if the caretaker would be able to take care of her during the day (food, walks, etc). 

She came up with a compromise where she would bring Chester to stay with us over the weekend at my house. However, Ravioli and Chester tend to fight and can’t be in the same room together unsupervised. Therefore, I would have to put Ravioli in the local kennel for the night so that my gf and Chester could stay with me. Although Ravioli has been to this kennel before, she does not like it. I thought that it would be easier for her parents to just have the caretaker watch Chester instead. To me, it felt like the burden of having the dog being looked after had now been passed onto me.

My gf expressed this to her parents. They did not change their mind, but they did offer to pay for the kennel for the night, which was very nice. My gf and I got in a little bit of a fight about it, but in the end, we decided to go with the kennel option. I am still upset about having to put Ravioli in the kennel and feel that this was a bit selfish of her parents. I think having a person they know and trust with their own relative also watch their dog for the weekend is completely reasonable. Instead, they insisted that my gf watch Chester, which has now made things a lot more complicated and also more negatively impacts me and especially Ravioli.  

So, who is the AH?
Gf’s parents for insisting that my gf watch Chester instead of the caretaker they already have
My gf for not standing up to her parents
Me for making this a bigger issue than it needed to be
Also me, but for choosing to spend time with my gf, and as a result putting my dog in the kennel.",1
"I own a company, and my wife has an executive level position at it. 14 months ago, she gave birth to our son. We elected to have a C Section and she went on maternity leave a month before she was scheduled for it. 

My wife expected that 3 months would be more than enough. However, after giving birth, and having agreed that we would only be having one child together ( I already had 3 daughters), my wife was exceptionally adamant about not missing a moment of our son's formative moments because she knew that he'd only be a baby for so long.

When the time came when she should have gone back to the office, I didn't have the heart to refuse her when she said she needed more time. After giving birth, she joined a mom specific life coaching program and still sees a life coach regularly.  She also volunteered for underprivileged kids.

After a year had flown by people started asking my wife when she was coming back. Unbeknonst to them, my wife had discussed the fact that she had some light abdominal separation and wanted a tummy tuck, after which she was itching to get back to work. Around that time, another employee at the company, "" Mary"", had gone on maternity leave. Unfortunately because she has not worked for the company for more than a year, she was not entitled to FMLA and was given 6 weeks off for her birth, one week of which she took prior to the birth.

Around a month ago, we decided to go for it and the surgery went perfectly. My wife was advised to take at least two weeks off from work, but her doctor said to take 4. However, the other day, my wife asked me for around two more weeks before she officially went back to work because more rest after surgery couldn't hurt. I agreed and we announced that she would be resuming her duties February 1st.

Mary spent 5 weeks after giving birth at home before returning to the office. Yesterday, after only a few days back at the office, she asked her manager if she could take more time off, begging for at least a week. The manager in question brought this up with me, and I told him to deny Mary her request. The reason is because while my wife's duties could be taken up by others, Mary's team was borderline understaffed and her customer service position required her to be there at work. One person leaving is tough on the rest.

When I went to personally tell Mary this, she looked very upset. She angrily said that my wife has been gone for a year and that the nurse she sees blames the stress and body pains caused by coming back so early for her struggles in breastfeeding. I apologized but reiterated that it was a busy season for the customer service team and that perhaps we could discuss her getting more time off down the line.

When I told my sister about this encounter, she said I was being the asshole for giving my wife special treatment. AITA for denying Mary's request after having just allowed my wife an extra two weeks?",1

The sound of it was super loud, I definitely couldn’t hear the movie through the crinkling of the bag being torn. I was also just distracted by whatever the hell she was doing. I looked at her as she proceeded to unfold the bottom of the bag and lick the butter off the paper. 

She saw my disgusted face and met it by laughing “the jackpot is when the creases get all packed with butter at the bottom.”

I was so disgusted at this point I couldn’t laugh or even respond. I just kind of froze. It makes my stomach churn thinking of consuming straight butter. 

For background, my girlfriend isn’t fat, really, but she does carry a little extra weight, and she’s often complaining about it. Once every few days at least, she looks in the mirror and says something to the effect of how fat she feels, asks if she looks fat, asking if she’s pretty, grips her thighs and makes them jiggle to show how fat she is… and in that moment, all I could think of were those times, then watching her eat straight butter, if that stuff even is actual butter at all. 

I was obviously put off and she is not one to be able relax when something is off, so she asks “What, are you grossed out that I’m an easy, breezy, beautiful butter girl?” The fact she was just joking when I was so genuinely grossed out had the opposite effect and just made me get more upset. 

“I just don’t understand, you complain about your weight all the time, and you think you’re going to change that by licking butter from popcorn bags?” 

She was quiet for a while after that and I went on to say that I didn’t think she was fat, just that it’s hard to listen to her complain about one thing then do something like lick butter at the same time. I told her that surely I’m not the only one who finds that sort of thing gross, and she just took it and made it ten times worse. She ended up getting really upset by the end of the fight, saying she feels stupid for ever being “vulnerable” with me, she brought up habits of mine she thinks are weird but she apparently “keeps to herself”, which I told her she shouldn’t have to do, I was getting mad that popcorn bags were getting her this upset to begin with. 

She is still just being really cold and hardly speaking to me since that argument and I’m at a loss. I don’t think I should have to grovel for forgiveness for not thinking this habit is just another cute, quirky little thing she does. If I started smacking gum and she told me she found it gross, I’d just stop without turning it into a big fight. AITA?",1
"My (36F) husband (39M) and I are going on a brief vacation with our daughters (twins, 5 yo). I was busy at work getting things done before I had to go away, and when I came home I saw that my husband had already packed our girls’ bags, which is something that I usually do whenever we leave town. 

So I opened the bags to see what he put in there and to see if he hadn’t forgotten anything. He asked me what I was doing, and I told him I was just double checking. To my surprise he got mad. He said I made him feel like I don’t even trust him to pack two bags, and that I sometimes complain that he could help more with the girls and around the house but I always take matters into my own hands when he tries to be proactive. 

I told him he’s making a big deal out of this, I was simply double checking – and thank god I did because he didn’t pack enough underwear and packed a sweater that doesn’t fit our daughter anymore. He is now giving me the silent treatment. Could I have been the AH here?",1
"My partner (33m) and I (30m) went to a lunar new year parade with his family this past Saturday.

With 55 mins left of the parade, my partner suggested, “if you want to go to a bar nearby and wait, feel free to do so. I’ll text you a few mins out and we’ll meet back here.”

I went to a bar nearby, ordered a drink, went on Twitter to kill time, and looked at a few restaurants for dinner.

At 7:50pm while I was trying to order a second drink, a stranger pulled up to the bar and sat right next to my seat to order a drink. He was rowdy and asked if anybody wanted to do a shot. No one responded including myself.

As I was there at the bar, he was borderline harassing and begging me to do to a shot with him. I reluctantly accepted. After having a sip of that shot, I put it down. I went on to order a second drink and asked him if he wanted anything as I didn’t want to feel like I owed this random person anything. 

As my second drink and his beer arrived, he started making a small talk about sports and asked if I was local. I said yes as my partner and I just moved to the area. 

After finding out that I was gay, he shifted the conversation to a proposition. He suggested that we both should go to a bathroom to give each other a b-job.

I declined and responded that, “my partner and I don’t do things outside of the relationship without each other’s permission.” He kept on insisting as I kept on declining. He, then, asked if I was good at it. I annoyingly responded, “yes, I am really really good at it, but it’s not happening dude.”

At 8pm, my partner texted me to head back. I downed the rest of my drunk. As I was getting up to leave, the stranger asked me if I could help him get one of the girls at a table nearby. I declined again. He kept yelling that I was lame as I was walking away.

When I found my partner, I gave him a quick rundown of what had just happened. I whispered in his ear because I didn’t want his family and people around us to hear. He thought it was funny and wished he was there.

After we got home from dinner, my partner started interrogating me. After I gave him full details and explained my rationale why I accepted a shot and bought this person a beer back. My partner became upset. He accused me of lying about having two drinks and betraying him by buying this person a drink in return and flirting with this guy by saying that, “I was really really good at it.”

He went on to ask, “let’s see how you feel if I buy someone a drink.” I responded, “go ahead. I don’t really care as long as you don’t do anything with them.” He stormed off, left the house, drove to a bar, and texted me, “when you admit it’s wrong, I’ll come home.” I responded, “guess you’ll never come home then.”

He went on to say that I’m a trash boyfriend and that I owed him an apology for lying and betraying. I refused to and we have not spoken since.

Am I the asshole?",1
"My Mom passed in 2018 and I became disabled the same year, 9 weeks before she passed. My stepdad started clearing her room immediately.  My stepsister, best friend (since ’96) and I went through her clothes. We each took some and a couple years of low contact, around 2020, she told me that she can’t wear/fit my Mom’s clothes and that she’d give them to me since they were my Mom’s. After lock-down I mentioned them to her a couple times and she said oh yeah still never got them.   


In 2022 I realized my daughter had to have a couple of surgeries the next year so I told all of my family and my best friend what was going to be happening. She told me during that she was just “too busy “ to spend time with friends but she was constantly going out with others but she’d call. She only contacted me a handful of times and didn’t ask even once her. She also didn’t tell any of my kids Happy Birthday last year when she used to without fail. 

 At Christmas she texted me last minute asking if we could join her at her house for Christmas which we couldn’t because I had seriously injured my knee. She stopped by for approximately 20 minutes to give us the gifts she bought and before she left I asked her to please make time for us to talk because I needed to get some things off my chest. That was 2 months ago.   


She randomly texted me on February 23rd and told me she went through her clothes and had the old things in 5 trash bags did I want anything. I was starting to write No thank you when she said she put my Mom’s clothes in there too. I told her I just wanted my Mom’s stuff please. She then told me she didn’t know what was hers so I should go through them myself. I stopped and typed “You don’t know if you put my Mom’s stuff in trash bags?” She told me  not to make it sound like she was throwing them away and that’s why she wanted me to go through them but to me that was exactly what she was telling me she was doing.   


I took a deep breath and told her I didn’t want to have this conversation over text and could she please bring them and put them in my garage for me or if not I could have my son get them. She ignored me for several minutes and when I sent that I needed to know please and she texted back “I am very sorry to have bothered you with this but I have decided not to get rid of my old clothing at this time.“ I asked her to please find my Mom’s stuff so I could get them from her she told “No.“ I explained that this was affecting me adversely and to please put herself in my position and she said she would be grateful because she didn’t have to even tell me she was giving them away and I would never have even known otherwise If she hadn’t.

I told her that I now realized she didn’t want anything to do with us given her actions of the past several years. I begged her to give me the clothes back but she completely ignored me and still hasn’t responded. My husband says that I had a right to demand her clothes be given to me but now I’m not sure. AITA?",1
"I'm twenty two and my sister is sixteen, we're incredibly close and I practically raised her. A little over a year ago I found out I was pregnant, and my son is now six months old. 

My little sister suffers a lot with mental health issues and has used reborn dolls as a coping mechanism for a few years. All shes ever really wanted to do was become a mother, when she found out I was pregnant she was over the moon. 

Since having my son we've had a sort of co-parenting thing going on, but she does most of the work. She naturally takes over, and if I get up to change him or something she practically begs to do it. Every now and then I tell her I need to do it because I need to actually bond with my child, but she seems to be in much higher spirits these last six months. 

My parents hate that she does anything for him, and often times scream at me for forcing her to be a mother when I was the one who got knocked up.

Other family members agree (which I find insane because half of them haven't even met my baby) and I've been getting a lot of backlash. It's gotten to the point where we hide out in mine and my son's room all day so my sister can have bonding time with him. 

A few people said I'll confuse my son on who his mother is which makes no sense to me because most kids grow up with aunts, but hey ho. 

Am I the asshole? I feel like she's doing a hell of a lot for my baby so I understand where everyone is coming from, but she also seems to really enjoy it and I don't want to take that away from her?",1
"My daughter has recently decided to get some tattoos to symbolise moments/memories in her life that she shared with her siblings and just things that are significant to her. I'm all for the idea, I think it's brilliant, she intends to get them on her lower legs for 'The people who stayed with her every step of the way', I think it's beautiful gesture. However, while I'm usually for her body her choice, I worry she's going to regret the tattoos she has chosen. 

She has 5 siblings and her choices are as follows  
A container of fish food  
Halo energy sword  
Duckling with a knife  
Purple mouthwash  
and a bomb with kitten ears on it

These ideas just seem like they could be easily regrettable and...honestly kind of stupid. She's got a couple of tattoos already but none are outrageous or tacky. I brought up my concerns to her and she explained the memory behind each of them but it still doesn't sit well with me. I told her she could at least pick better memories and those particular tattoos aren't going to suit or look very good.

My wife says I'm a complete AH at this point and if the memories are significant to her then that's what she should get but that my daughter is now second guessing herself. I just don't want her to regret something that will be on her for life. 

AITA?",1
"I (20M) live in a flat with 5 others at university. There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem

She always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.

So we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).

I have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.

I had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.

So I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. 

She keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. 

The guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. 

So the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.

I then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing else I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?

**To those saying that the other flatmates are all guys, that's NOT true. Aside from the bitch, there are two girls, and the rest guy.**

**To the people telling me that I should have spoken nicely to her, I SAID IN THE FIRST FEW PARAGRAPHS I ALREADY DID THIS. Me and the other flatmates asked her nicely to stop on several occasions and she didn't follow through. What she did was say ''Okay'' and then continue to do the same shit. I'm writing this as a clarification for those comments.**",1
"so ive had an issue with my sister, and we’re not talking currently because of the situation.

To preface (and what makes this situation more complicated), is that Ive been sporadically borrowing money from my sister over the last year or so. I always pay her back on time and give her about 20% interest, but this has created a weird dynamic which i fully take responsibility for.

My sister asked me to take headshots and design a book cover for her in september, a self published low key poetry book. I was flattered she asked, we didn’t discuss pricing -she did mention she would pay me though, so that was the understanding. Normally for something like this I would charge $500-$1000 for a client, but tbh I was expecting her to assume it was more of a $200-300 deal which i was fine with.

We do the shoot, I design the cover.  My photoshop was expired so I told her that if she wants me to do this we would have to start a free trial on her email since ive already exhausted mine, i told her i would cancel it after.

I borrowed $600 from my sister the week prior, i told her i would pay her back $700 before this happened.  After the shoot and the delivery of the design, she told me to waive the $100 of interest i offered her for borrowing money and that would be my payment for the job. 

I was slightly annoyed about this. Obviously grateful that she had lent me money, although “paying” me out of interest that I was giving her as a thank you, especially at only $100, was a bit irritating for me. But it was my fault for not discussing rates and setting up expectations so I let it slide.

A couple weeks ago, my sister texts me about how she got a text from adobe saying that her payment method was about to expire. 

She asked me what it was about and if i cancelled the subscription. To be quite honest, I lied because I didn’t want to deal with the reaction so I said I thought I cancelled it and that’s weird.

I told her she should try doing a chargeback with her bank. She didn’t notice until this email, but she realized she’d been charged $20 a month for the subscription for 5 months since we did the shoot. 

She totally flipped at me and said i can’t ever take responsibility, she can’t believe that i didn’t cancel it, i’m so irresponsible and literally told me to fuck off.

I get that i’m in the wrong for lying about cancelling the subscription, i should have probably just acknowledged it outright. And idk why I said i would cancel it in the first place, that should have been something that she did.

My thing is that while it’s annoying, the only reason I downloaded this subscription was solely for the objective of doing work for her.  I said that and she freaked and started telling me to fuck off, etc. I responded saying that I get she’s annoyed but i don’t appreciate her hurling insults at me and degrading my character. i also sent her the money for what she was overcharged.

Do we both have ownership here or am i fully in the wrong?",1
"My sister is a hardcore vegan. She is against all animal cruelty and suffering and it is one of the main things I admire her for. I have 2 kids, Cassy(7F) and Chase(5M). 

My sister’s wedding allowed kids, I was very grateful for this as I’m seen as the, “overbearing mom” I don’t like having babysitters since they’re just randos who could do god knows what to my kids, but it also was made clear that it was a vegan wedding. 

Chase has been going through a phase where he picks one food and sticks with it for months, I have tried to offer him other foods he likes during these times but he just wants his chosen item. If he does not get it he ends up throwing a huge tantrum, I don’t support his behaviour and try and steer him away from it but sometimes it gets tricky.

His chosen food this time was sausage rolls.
Knowing this I knew that if he got fussy at the wedding he would cause a disturbance. Cassy also tends to want things that her brother has but usually gets sick of them after 2-3 weeks.

 I had packed a lot them since if her brother had ate them all then Cas would’ve started an uproar.

Everything was fine until I got asked by my son if there were any sausage rolls, I had given him some and asked Cassy if she wanted any but she declined as she had gotten tired of them fairly early. 

I still had a lot left over since combined they ate a truck load.
One of the guests, sister’s friend Matt, must’ve seen this since he came over and asked me for one. I didn’t think much of it and handed him one.

I’m not sure if this is important or not but not many of my sister’s friends are vegan or even vegetarian.

A few minutes after Matt had came up to me two more people did. I had declined this time because it felt a little rude, But the friends left with an annoyed expression.

My daughter had come back up to me after playing with the other kids and changed her mind and wanted some. I let her grab some then she ran again.

My sister then came up to me and was glowing red, she started going off on me about how it was her wedding and how I couldn’t just hand out non vegan food to others since it was disrespectful. I tried to explain to her that it was just for my kids but when she had told me that, “no one else’s kid’s are acting like this they’re all fine with the food maybe if you were a better parent Chase wouldn’t be in this phase to begin with.” 

Like I said earlier I’m a bit of an overbearing mother so when she had said that I just snapped. I yelled about how her closest friends didn’t even like her food (most of the food was prepared by her) and some other immature/hurtful things.

I got up and left with my kids, arguing while walking out.

My sister has blocked me on everything and our parents&friends are calling me the asshole for walking out on the wedding over something so small and that I should just apologise, but until she takes back what she said about my kids I’m making 0 effort for her.

So what do you think Reddit, am I the asshole?",1
"So I've been invited to a vegan household for a dinner party. Of the total people going, 6 of 9 aren't vegans. 
Anytime a meal is hosted elsewhere we have two meals, one vegan and one not, so everyone can enjoy what they like. Not here though, this is a strictly vegan household. No cooking meat products on the BBQ. No cheese, no eggs, no fish. 

I get not wanting to cook meat on their bbq, I have an entire section of my grill sectioned off for vegan/gluten free cooking. 
 
I found out what they are making for everyone one. I'm allergic to mushrooms, and they know it, and their main course is a portobello steak, it feels on purpose. 

I would feel disrespected as a host if a guest brought their own food to my dinner party, then again I try really hard to make sure everyone has options for them at mine. 

So WIBTA If I brought a George foreman and some burgers to cook up outside?",1
"


My f33 sister f34 has been struggling with infirtility for years. She and my brother in law resorted to so many options including trying rounds of I.V.F. this is costly so as a result a number of I.V.F cycles had cost them a lot and none of them worked. My sister and brother in law were advised to take break seeing the physical and emotional and financial toll this unsuccesful I.V.F treatment has had on them but my sister wanted to try one more time before she enters her mid thirties where her chances are lower.


My parents refused to give her any more money so she came over to my place where she had a mental breakdown begging me to help. I decided to help her out and helped pay by pulling 13k from my husband and mine's shared account. My husband was out of town for days and I didn't go out of my way to tell him after he missed my initial call before going forth and giving my sister the money.

I brought it with him on the phone later and he blew up at me saying I shouldn't have made such decision and taken money out of our joint account without consulting him first but I said I tried calling and he didn't pick up the first time but he said still I shouldn't have made any moves til I had talked to him first then said he didn't agree that I gave a huge sum of money that he worked hard for given the fact he contributes 70% to this account and said I messed up big time. I tried to explain my sister's situation and how this was an emergency and assured him she'd return the money but he said no she won't since she doesn't even have job, same with her husband and said I shouldn't support their bad decision to want a baby when they're broke to negin with. I had an argument with him and said he was acting cruel and unsupportive of my family but he corrected me saying he's not a doormat and he worked hard for the money that I had no problem giving away without even telling him but that is my sister and I felt obligated to help her out yet he refused to understand that.

That was the last time we spoke, he demanded I take the money back asap but I haven't responded to him yet. AITA or was he?",1
"My son Ben came out as bisexual a couple years ago. Most of our family accepted him. Although I know he disliked some of our actions when he came out (we are still in contact with familiars or friends that didn’t accept him), we tried to be as supportive as we could. And a bit after he came out he introduced us to his boyfriend. He was a really sweet guy and clearly loved our son.

However about a year ago some rumors, apparently spread by my other son James, said that he used to be a woman. We didn’t believe it but eventually Ben confirmed that his boyfriend was trans, and I admit it was quite shocking and hard to process. This also kinda ruined the relationship between our sons. 

Now to the problem itself. Yesterday we decided to have a small gathering with the four of us ( me, my wife and our two sons ). We ate a delicious meal, we talked a lot, in general we were having a good time. I could tell that there was some tension between our sons but I thought that they could handle it. Then I decided to ask Ben “what is [his boyfriend] doing now?”, to which James replied “yeah, what is **she** doing?”. This immediately angered Ben, so they started insulting each other. Luckily I managed to change the subject and tell them to calm down before they started an actual fight. 

After James left, Ben confronted me about this. He was angry that I didn’t “defend him or at least say something to James”. Now, I agree that what James said was rude, but it was Ben who insulted his brother and worsened the situation. So I don’t think it would have been right for me to defend or pick a side. But he didn’t see it that way, he told me that “either you do something or I won’t visit again”. Which hurts me a lot.

Since then I have not talked to either of them directly, but apparently the rest of our family is choosing sides. Ben is still very angry at me, and although I understand why he was angry at his brother I think he is being unreasonable with me.",1
"(Sorry if my english is bad, its not my first language(:)

So today, i did something stupid i think, and i dont know if this is gonna ruin my friendship with this person, lets call him alex. So Alex and i, were in a discord call just chatting, i was watching him play overwatch, and all was well. Until i got an idea. His birthday is coming up in two months time, and i wanted to crochet him a present, only i couldnt tell him that. So i had to make him pick something i could crochet, without making it obvious i was crocheting him a present. So i asked him some kinda random question like: “what is something you really want” which doesnt make much sense, cause its a really broad category. But nonetheless, he answered but it wasnt what i was looking for, nor was it something i could actually crochet. So i narrowed down the question, but he still didnt give me anything i could use. He started to get frustrated, (obviously) but i didnt know what to do. So i just continued to ask more and more questions, and he became more and more frustrated, i probably could’ve gone a better way about this, but it was already too late at this point. Then i just gave up, and i named some ideas to him he could pick from, (it was like 15 items or something) and he picked something. (Keep in mind we were laughing like crazy through this aswell.) when he had picked something, he asked me “why did you make me answer all those questions?” Which is fair enough. I never gave any context as to what i was doing. But i couldnt say that i was crocheting him a present- so i just told him i had a bunch of questions for him, each in a different category he had to figure out, and i couldnt tell him what category it was, he had to guess an item or thing, in that category in order to move on to the next question, and i asked him i think 6 or so more questions, and he just became more and more frustrated because it was annoying he had to anser all the question ofcourse. And he was so mad and i honestlt found it hilarious. I swear i didnt know that he would get so mad! We then finished the questions and he still wanted answers. So i just gave up and explained what i was trying to do, and why i tried covering it up with all those questions, and he got realmy annoyed and said: “why couldnt you have said that 6 questions ago” and other stuff.  He then got really quiet and we didnt really speak at all until i said i had to go to bed. And i still dont know if he was actually mad at me or just joking. I also apologized so so so many times i really didnt mean to make him mad, or frustrated, and i feel so bad. Am i the a-hole?",1
"My husband eats frozen breakfast sandwiches. Every day. Often as many as five or six a day, all day and all night. Our freezer is stuffed with breakfast sandwiches. His breath smells of rotten eggs because he’s constantly eating egg patties. Half the time I cook, he’ll skip whatever I’ve prepared to have one of these frozen sandwiches. It’s embarrassing, especially when we have company.

Historically, I haven’t really cared. He’s an adult and can eat whatever his limited palette enjoys. But several weeks ago he paused a movie we were watching to get a snack and came back with one of these goddamn sandwiches, and something in me just snapped. The smell, the sight, the idea of a grown-ass man who subsists on these hideous little frozen sandwiches… I was revolted. Ever since, I can hardly tolerate them. 

I’ve been trying subtly to get him to stop (it’s not healthy, your breath smells bad, etc) but he bought 24 more of them yesterday and today I finally snapped. I told him I find them repulsive, and that I wish he would eat like a grown man. He was upset. Then he microwaved yet another of these damn sandwiches, and walked off with it. 

AITA? I think I might be because my husband (although not formally diagnosed) has a lot of “aspy” qualities and might be neurodivergent. He is especially quirky about food. I could count the things he eats regularly on one hand.

EDIT: thank you all for your judgements and kind messages, especially you folks who are neurodivergent or who have neurodivergent loved ones. the perspective was sorely needed. I owe my husband an apology, I am the asshole.

EDIT 2: I apologized to my husband. he says he wasn’t upset, just annoyed because having something other than breakfast sandwiches is inconvenient. he also said that he doesn’t care about the inconvenience, now that he knows how i feel, and he’ll eat something else for lunch/dinner — we compromised that breakfast is an appropriate time for breakfast sandwiches. ;) 

i broached the topic of seeing someone about a formal diagnosis, but he wasn’t into that at all, so… we will keep on keeping on, undiagnosed but working on our communication. he’s a great guy, i’m lucky to have him. thank you all for your comments, of all judgements.

EDIT 3: Just to address some ongoing comments/discussion… Oral hygiene is definitely part of the issue, I have asked him to brush his teeth more frequently and use mouthwash. for whatever reason the rotten egg smell/taste is very persistent, and results in him tasting like sulfur-flavored listerine, which is horrible. reducing the amount of frozen eggs he eats does help.

LAST EDIT: Thank you for your concern about whether I may be pregnant. I am quite certain I am not. i have an IUD and Aunt Flow just came for a visit. :)

my husband and i went grocery shopping and we picked out an assortment of healthier, egg-free, pre-made frozen meal options for him to try — same convenience, but more diversity, and maybe even some vegetables lol! he’s going to try them out and figure out what he likes. he also said that he didn’t want to get a frozen biscuits and gravy because “I only like it when you make it” :’) so that was really nice to hear. 

we’re gonna work it out, Reddit! thanks for your help ❤️",1
"I (F21) have been undergoing a lot of stress lately, mainly due to family issues. After taking my mom to physical therapy i get home and call my bf (19), he’s playing rainbow six siege and we talk a bit before i fall asleep for about 1hr 30mins. I wake up and he’s playing the game again but i go to make something to eat. After cooking, cleaning, and eating, which was like an hour and 15 minutes later, he’s still on the game. I try to find something to do but it doesn’t really last as i get bored easily when i’m by myself. I get called to do tasks for my mom to which i frequently have to mute myself and go do them, which take 5-15 minutes each time. Each time i get called up i’m continuously getting more annoyed with her demands and the fact that my bf is yelling in my airpod at the game. The screaming becomes too much and i hang up, expecting that my bf would call back or at least text me to see what was up. 15 minutes later he texts me asking if i was okay, to which i responded annoyingly, “yeah you were being too loud to notice that i was even here.” I knew he was still playing, being oblivious, which was making me even angrier. He still doesn’t bother to call me back, texts instead, and i clearly display that i’m upset and annoyed. He then says he’ll “call me in a few” to which this sends me into a fury because who the hell can’t just get off the game asap and call their s/o to see what has been distressing them. After waiting a few minutes he still didn’t call so i called him myself. When he picks up he’s still on the game and i say “what the hell are you doing” “get off the fucking game” in front of his brother and cousin since he had his phone on speaker. I insist that he get off and while he eventually does he doesn’t do it without complaining that what i did was controlling. Now that everyone heard how i yelled at him they all think that i’m crazy. While it was wrong of me to yell at him like that at the time it felt needed because i felt ignored and neglected. He’d been on a majority or the day, and his stubbornness to get off to me feels like he doesn’t care. On top of that he’s whining about that fact that since i made him get off before his ranked match was over he got banned. He never even asked if i’d wanted to do anything that day. After arguing back and forth we sort of just dropped it but i still feel neglected. I play video games too but i never would hesitate to leave if my s/o was upset. He said he didn’t pick up on my distress (because he was focused on the game) and said that i can’t expect him to recognize things through text. Everyone that overheard our conversation is now warning him about me, as if my FIRST toxic outburst towards him makes me a problem as if he hasn’t had his moments before.",1
"My wife went back to her mother's home country to bring her mom's ashes back. Her bother is still living there. She went there for 2 whole weeks, the first few days was to take care of the ashes and other misc items that was left. The rest of the week and a half, she was out visiting old college/high school friends. 

I am home taking care of our 9 year old daughter. It was tough but I did not complain at all about it. My wife went during the time when my daughter had a state exam and I was the one who was working with her daily to get her prepared for the exam. Again no complains. During the last week I was not feeling well. A bad cough, fatigue, headache, migraine and etc. Not sure what was going on but I really wasn't all that well. When we facetime she asked me what was going on and I told her. Again wasn't complaining or asking her to come back. 

Fast forward to this Sunday night. My wife comes back, lands and the first thing she does after her plan lands is not I'm back, or I miss you guys. She messages me complaining we (me and my daughter) missed the online language class. I told her that yes, I forgot between dinner and everything that was happening it just escaped my mind. I told her it was no intentional. Nope my wife was just ripping me in text messages. 

For all the work that I did, the one tiny mistake I made and she slams for after 2 weeks. AM I really the asshole here?",1
"My(M26) girlfriend(F25) is gluten free due to a health issue, so she sticks to the same 5 recipes types(breakfast, lunch, snacks and dinner) so the same 20ish recipes. Every morning, she fixes the same breakfast of gluten free waffles and hard boiled eggs. 

We moved in with each other 2 weeks ago. I was fine with her breakfast at first. But she makes the house stink with the hard boiled eggs. So she said she was fine with getting hard boiled eggs from the store. She said she prefers the fresh hard boiled eggs since the store bought ones soil easier. 

This week, when we was doing our budgeting, there was no room left in the budget for my snacks and beers, and the superbowl was coming up so i was going to have some buddies over to watch, so i needed extra money for that. So I asked her if she really needed the eggs. She started to throw a tantrum saying that I already changed her routine once and that she wasn't going to change it again. 

It shouldn't be that hard but AMITA?

Edit: she has to buy a certain brand of eggs that has a bunch of special properties. I'm not entire sure on it. She said her nutritionist said for her to stick to that specific brand and for 12 eggs it's like $8. I've tried to tell her that the brand doesn't matter but she won't listen",1
"One of my close friends is also my co-worker. Sometimes, I stay over at their house after work to wait out the traffic on my way home. They said I have an open invite to come over anytime, but I only come over if they specifically invite me.

Yesterday, we talked about hanging out after work, but our schedules didn't line up, so my friend said I could come over the next day and we could hang. We texted that evening, and I said I would bring over my hot cocoa.

Today, their car broke down in the morning so they had to Uber to work and then Uber home when AAA came. We had a training together in the afternoon.

They forgot about me coming over after work and went home without me. We would normally head out around 5 if I was coming over. I called around 7:30 and asked if they remembered our conversation about hanging out. I was pissed off. My tone of voice probably was angry.

This isn't the first time they've forgotten hangouts and meetings with me. They are generally a very forgetful, absentminded person. When they told me they forgot, I said, ""That's informative. Have a good night."" I do understand they had a hectic morning, but they saw me literally an hour before they left even if we didn't interact.

They hung up but called back and talked about how they had a tough day + we didn't interact much at work as for why they forgot. They said my tone of voice was so ""aggressive"" and ""hostile"" about what they believe is a minor issue. They asked why I didn't text them earlier and said I made them feel like I was reprimanding them.

We both apologized - them for forgetting and me for making them feel scolded. We eventually cooled down.

As I thought about it more after we talked, it just didn't sit right with me. I was frustrated that I apologized. With a close friend, I want to be able to express my frustration honestly, but of course, I would not make any accusations or judgments. But maybe I am ridiculous to be this upset over something like this. And maybe the anger is still a judgment in itself?

So that's why I'm asking y'all if I was an asshole to express my frustration the way I did.",1
"Title. My (25m) dad (64m) was talking about how one of his buddies was going to buy something big and wanted to take almost all of his money out of his bank account. The bank told him that they couldn't do that without at least a day's notice, and that he'd have to do it in installments each day.  
  
He got angry and did just that, and emptied his account and moved everything to another bank that claimed that they could empty his entire account, without any form of notice, if he asked them to. I said that he must be stupid if he thinks a bank will give him all his money, or even most of it from his account without notice. Because banks don't have that much money on hand. And he didn't seem to understand that.  
  
My dad got angry at me, like I was TA for pointing out that his buddy is stupid for not understanding how banks work.  
  
So AITA in this situation or not?  
  
Edit: I guess I'm TA here. Whatever.  
  
Edit 2: and apparently I wasn't taught properly on how banks work. Because I was always told that if you wanted to withdraw more than just a few thousand, you had to tell the bank ahead of time so they could get the money for you.",1
"My (35M) colleague/work-friend (27F) texted me to say that her dad called her, informing her that he had passed out in the train and hit his head. Colleague said that her dad was at the hospital’s emergency department, that he seems okay but a bit dazed. 


I asked if he passed out on his own or due to sudden braking of the train. Colleague replied that her dad passed out on his own, to which I said it is a heart issue and that he should buy an Apple Watch to track his health, and that the watch can even notify an emergency contact if the wearer had a fall. Colleague said that those are not the words she wanted to hear, and that I was “fucking cold hearted”. 


I asked how was I cold hearted and what kind of reply she was expecting, because (in our country) if you tell people you have a cold, they will say: “Must be a cold or flu virus going around. Do take some vitamin c.”


Colleague said, “I was worried to death about my dad. So yeah sorry I was expecting something from you. I will never expect anything from you ever again. What a friend you are. Why the f*ck would I want to hear that. How does that comfort me in that situation.”


Colleague said that she expected some words of comfort to help her as she was distressed and worried about her dad. I replied that I spoke my mind and that I was also not rude; I offered some help in the form of a protective and preventive measure, which was logical. 


Colleague replied that if I was logical and thinking as a logical person, I would have known what to do and say in that scenario, that I was not being logical and just being an asshole.


I replied that logical is a method of reasoning based on reason and sound ideas or facts, and that using an Apple Watch to track one’s health and safety is a logical step.


As her dad had called her to personally inform her of the incident, it was evident that he was very much conscious, speaking, and somewhat able. Her dad was not in a critical condition (coma, bedridden, or dead). As such, there was no need for me to “comfort” or “console” her. She has a boyfriend for that purpose. AITA for not offering any “words of comfort”? 


Some background info about myself:
I am a problem solver by nature. I also have a degree in psychology, where I was thought in neuropsychology that passing out is a heart problem. ",1
"My husband (36M) and I (42M) just passed our 19th anniversary of when we started dating. He was happy all last week about it. I had to miss dinner last Friday night, a week ago, and had to leave over the weekend for an emergency work situation. 

On Wednesday when I came home I brought him a nice bouquet because he enjoys flowers and that kind of romantic gesture. He didn’t seem too upset but this morning when I left I noticed the flowers were out on the porch and were having a heatwave at the moment so they wouldn’t last the day. I moved them back inside for him. 

When I came home the flowers were back on the porch. I went to bring them back in and he put them back out and told me they had to stay outside because the lilies are toxic to his cat. Honestly I don’t think the cat will try to eat them and this was an expensive arrangement so I can’t help but feel he’s trying to send me a message about how he feels about prioritizing my career over dinner and the weekend. He’s constantly doing little things like that to get me upset with him but he can still claim he didn’t do anything.

When I asked if he’s worried about it to just keep the cat away he told me he can’t do that because he’s too worried about them as if I did it on purpose. I’m not the one being the asshole here?",1
"Wife and I own a home in an HOA. We split the mortgage and HOA fee 50/50. Recently a vacancy opened up on the Board of Directors and I applied for it and was chosen to serve. As compensation, the HOA fee ($400) is waived for our unit. My wife wants to split this windfall 50/50. I feel since I’m on the Board and do all the work, the $400 should be all mine. She thinks if I keep the $400 it’s tantamount to her *paying me* $200 since our overall housing costs have dropped $400 but she doesn’t benefit financially. This has caused some of our worst fighting and I am leaning towards just giving in and splitting the money even though
I do all the work. Am I the asshole?

UPDATE: I’ve seen the err of my ways and will split the rebate with my wife. Before I get into it, I just want to say there are some very sick people on this subreddit who think they know things about me and my wife with absolutely no basis in fact. But hey, it’s the Internet. Expect trash. As for the many people who commented like a normal person and especially the Redditors who DM’ed me and agreed with or validated my position, thank you. Ultimately, u/flyryan convinced me with saying “[t]he perk you are getting is no longer having to pay the HOA fees. Not a salary of $400/mo. They are saying your household no longer has to pay THEM for their service and you are turning around and collecting $200 from your wife. You’re essentially getting a free service (HOA membership) as a perk for your volunteer work and then reselling half of that service to your wife for $200. She is no longer paying HOA fees, but rather YOU to be HOA president.” 

Anyway—while I still believe my position has some logic behind it, I now see my wife’s perspective which helps soften my stance considerably. So I will share it.",1
"I (38M) and my wife (40 F) went out to a  party at a friends house and came back really late. My Dad objected to this on the next day and gave a moral lecture to my wife in my absence. I got to know about this when I came back from work. I confronted my father and had a huge argument with him in trying to explain him on how he should let me be and not interfere in my life. PS - it is not a regular story. Happened once in the entire year

We live in a joint family. My brother, his wife and son also stay with us. So they were taking care of the kid",1
"Title says it all, sole provider for family, all credit cards maxed, negative bank balance, upcoming missed payments until my next check, basically destitute for the foreseeable future.  My wife and I usually decorate on Black Friday, but this year I don't want to.  The thought of putting up our fake tree knowing I'll have nothing to put under it fills me with such a mix of shame, anger, and pain.  I would prefer to just let December pass and cut out as many things as I can until I can get my finances under control.  Plus, my daughter is 2. She won't know, care, or even remember one missed Christmas.  So, AITA?  I'm already a failure as a husband and father, so what say you here?

THIS HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL!  I never thought my sad man pity party would get this kind of response.  I was expecting to be called an asshole, validate my self loathing, and claw my way out of debt by working harder.  I did not expect the absolute torrent of love and support that I in no way deserve or can accept.

INFO (And I am so sorry for not making this crystal clear in the original post): Our mortgage and utilities are paid.  There is food in our fridge and my next paycheck(s) is secure, even though it, too, will all go to bills with none left over for gifts.  I pretended not to notice that we weren't keeping up our pre-child lifestyle without credit cards and I got in over my head and now have to dig myself out of a relatively deep hole meaning I won't have money for gifts and meals out and holiday gatherings and whatnot for a good bit of time to come.  But, I have a great job and an outstanding family support system who all live close by and know what debt feels like and will understand if we can't chip in this year with anything but our presence, but it just felt shameful to have the advantages I have and still manage to fuck it up as bad as I did without asking for help. 

As for all the people begging me to accept help, here is why I can't:  I make a good salary.  There is no chance of me or my family going hungry.  We have food and will have money for food budgeted into my paychecks, which are secure as my job is secure. I have an extremely well funded 401k from 18 years of office work and life insurance to safeguard my family.  Thank you all who were offering food.  Thank you all who offered to buy my 2 year old's amazon wish list.  She's 2 and does not have one.  My wife and I had already decided that she has too many toys and so we had only things like books and a learning tablet in mind for her.  She'll be ok if we can't buy her ""stuff"".  She already has ""stuff"".  Her close in age cousins live on our street and we exchange toys and clothes all the time and both our houses are cluttered with ""stuff"".  This was not about garnering pity or soliciting charity.  It was my insecurity equating gifts with love that warped Christmas for me.  It almost ruined Christmas for me.  Regardless of the vote here, I truly am THE asshole for that.  So please, turn your charity to your communities, your neighbors.  Not some middle class jagoff who spent himself into debt trying to prove how much he loved a family that only needed him to be a happy and healthy presence at home.  You all have humbled me beyond words, beyond charity.  You have given me both the perspective and the courage to seek professional help, both financial and psychological, and hopefully it's not too late for this stupid old man to become a better father and husband.  Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  His spirit is truly embodied in all of you beautiful and selfless redditors.  Never lose the light.  Love and cheer to all.  But as you can see, I deserve neither your charity nor your goodness, and I'm going to go disappear back into anonymity now if possible and work on me.

Update for those concerned:  I have not ever, even for a second, considered hurting myself.  Not once.  I'm showing my age here, but Goonies never say die.

Update for INFO, and I hope this answers all the questions people had, as there were many, and so I'm just going to write a bio that answers them all:  I live in the Mid-Atlantic United States.  When we got pregnant (after 6 years of trying and failing and treatments and tears) we found out that it would cost us $50 a month for my wife to work her current job and put our daughter in full time daycare, as day care costs upwards of $1600 a month for even local co-ops, to say nothing of the $2100+ that most daycare companies were asking.  The solution was for her to ""retire"" and take up the even harder job of full time mother.  I work 8-5 at a day job and I pick up shifts DJing at a local bar at night and DJ private events/weddings/etc... when I can book them.  My daughter was about to turn 2, and be able to start 3 day a week ""preschool"" for far less than the cost of 5 day a week daycare, meaning my wife could work again, at least part time.  I was in the referral process to find a surgeon to do my vasectomy when we found out that despite using birth control, my wife was pregnant again. We're due in February, a little boy this time.  Utter shock, disbelief, some truly unhealthy thoughts, and finally acceptance that I was going to have to continue to be the full time provider, as there was no way we could put 2 kids in full time care, so once again, my sainted wife will have to spend at least another 2 years as a full time mom.  My wife and I are old people(42M, 40F) who tried to have kids earlier in life, but couldn't despite multiple treatments, and only succeeded when we stopped trying so hard and resigned ourselves to the thoughts of a comfortable dual income no kids lifestyle full of travel and memories, Bringing one life into this world at 40 after everything we went through was a laugh, only for life to turn around and ""bless"" me with a second child.  My wife is overjoyed, and I am happy but terrified of how I will afford this.  She applied for part time seasonal work to help with our bills, but the job she was hired for has given her exactly 2 shifts in 2 weeks, and taken one of those shifts away at the last minute due to overstaffing.  She has a meeting with them today to find out if it's worth her time to stay employed there, dependent on if they can actually give her at the least 20 hours a week which she requested upon applying.  We have had joint finances since we were engaged.  We don't hide things from each other, we're both well aware of our money issues and have been working on ways to improve our financial situation. (Thank you all for the links and sites, I am bookmarking them all!).  We have and will keep communication open.  It was our promise made to each other 13 years ago to never shoulder our burdens alone.

Lastly (hopefully, I know this is long) I am humbled by your offers of charity, dear strangers.  Truly and deeply humbled.  I cannot accept them, be it out of foolish pride or some other moral driver, but know that your kind words and even kinder offers have softened my resolve to cancel Christmas this year.  I just spent 2 days with co-workers volunteering at 2 local food banks preparing meals, clothes, and groceries for the community, so if you're one of the many wonderful strangers who offered help, please give that help to your local charity.  I have a roof over my head, and food in my belly, and I could not ask for more, not when I have so much already.  

I still dread the thought of lugging that old fake tree out of the laundry room, but my feelings have to come 3rd, here and always.  My wife and daughter need the love and joy that that old tree will bring, and I need to give them everything I can, even if it's the just the spirit of the season. They deserve to feel the warmth of a festive home, and we already own the damn thing, so it's literally the least I can do.  My presents will be the 1 million pictures my wife will take of our daughter pulling all the ornaments she can reach off the tree and showing them to her with that beautiful smile she has.  Our families are close by, and our parents will no doubt do their best to spoil our daughter and I know it will be more than enough.


UPDATE!  Wife and I downloaded a budget app and are working with a family member who does financial planning. I, personally, spoke with someone (a professional) early this morning and in just the initial phone call she helped me realize that I was equating being able to give gifts with showing love to my family.  Not being able to afford baubles isn't going to mean I love them less, and I will need to accept that and I will continue to work with her as long as my insurance will allow.  Thanks to close friends with growing kids, we have an embarrassment of clothes and toys to sort through, and wrapping some of these items for my little girl to tear into is more than good enough for my wife and I.  My wife and I have plenty of clothes  Thank you to all who have offered to purchase things for us.  My heart bursts from the selfless and wonderful offers.  But, I meant what I said when I asked you to please point your humongous hearts to your local charities. I have more than enough ""things"" and taking things from strangers to compensate for my poor spending habits feels wrong.  It will be a tough few months, but I have a good job with opportunities to grow and am going to work with professionals to learn some much needed budget control, and work with a therapist to learn to accept help from family and friends when the new baby arrives and to be less hard on myself.  I am also going to spend more time with my local food bank, I signed up to help build meal kits this week to be distributed for Christmas in my community.  I'm planning on ""giving"" generously this season, just not in the consumerist sense.  I think that's a ""new tradition"" that my family can and will preserve for years to come.  Even y'all who called me a stupid cunt.  Thank you, too, for keeping me grounded.

To those of you who have asked how could I have tried for 6 years to have a kid and ""not bothered to budget for it once it came"" are greatly underestimating how much fertility treatments cost even with insurance, and how well and truly fucked American Healthcare really is.  We are taking steps to ensure that this kid will be our last, and I actually brought up abortion but my wife would not even consider it.  Thankful for that now.",1
"I (18F) and my best friend, Jane (18F) have been together basically since birth. Our Mom's were pregnant together, we went to school together and even lived together while her parents went through a divorce. In short, she is more like a sister to me and I would do anything for her, including turning down one of the best opportunities I had. 

At the end of my senior year, I had two great college offers, a large in-state school or a much more prestigious private university out-of-state that was offering me almost full tuition. On top of that, I have always dreamt of leaving my state and going somewhere where I feel I belong, which I knew this school could give me. 

However, I turned down the offer because Jane was so upset about the thought of me leaving and wanted us to room together at the In-state school, plus I was getting a full ride from them. So I chose to stay and have since spent over $7,000 (along with my parents) on dorm decor for our room. I have tried to stay positive, though each day I regret the decision I made to stay, I hate the college I chose. But I always remind myself that I did it for my friend and at least we'd be in it together.

But everything changed a week ago, when Jane told me she was pregnant. This came after months of me warning her to stop constantly having unprotected sex, as she would always swear by the pull out method and never using condoms. I'm talking constant arguments over it. However, Jane is a chronic idiot and I know that now. She doesn't listen, she thinks she has some kind of immunity to harm and now is crying at my doorstep over the situation she got herself into, and I have zero sympathy. Not only that, but I kind of hate her for it.

When Jane told me, the first thing I said was ""I gave up the best college offer I could get so you would be happy, and now it was all for nothing."" followed by much harsher words, ones I never thought I would ever say to her. She's extremely emotional and scared for the future. We live in a state, where she can't get end it legally even though that would be her first choice, and her parents are far too conservative to take her out of state for it. Meaning the only options are to pray, or cope. 

She broke down after this, screaming at me telling me I was being so unfair and cruel after she made a mistake, but to me it's more than a mistake, one that doesn't just effect her. I never want to judge teenage moms, my mom was one. But when I gave up so much to stay with her and now she will probably not even be able to go to college, plus the months of warning her against having unprotected sex, make me not even want to talk to her. I've supported her through thick and thin for years, but my patience is up. I feel that because of her I'm stuck in the state I dream to get out of, and there was no point in my decision at all. AITA?

"So am a woman who lives in a small city . And we all know that small cities are known for thier narrow and strict mindset . And I for what it’s worth was in the bad side as we can say I was doing some stuff that may be really not acceptable in my city or in all of the cities i guess. 
Well I just want it to give u a background .
So when I use to act up and do some shitty stuff I did not have a lot of friends back then maybe just one we can call her Sera so she was my ride or die I use to tell her everything I do before I even do it and she use to do the same . Well she was the complete opposite of me she never did anything that was bad she was just a normal introvert person at least that’s what I thaugh.
Well last summer I decided to change and set some morals to myself and start taking care of myself ,my family, education. So the first person I told was her and she was so happy for me she encouraged me to be better . this year is our last year of our education and we happened to be in the same class that made me so happy I got more close with her then ever . But sadly my grandmother got cancer and my mom was the only person to take care of her . And that really messed me up I started remembering what I did and how it would affect my family if they knew and how tired my mom is cause of grandma and I couldn’t sleep from the feeling of guilt. And she knew all about this she use to find me crying and immediately started crying with me .
I started isolating myself and stop talking to her I started acting angry for small stuff so we sadly spilt apart . Well I know and understand that it is completely my fault and am not denying that . And I apologised and tryed to win her back but it was never the same so as we grew apart she got some new friends and immediately started to make actions against me that made me angry so I went to her and said that if she doesn’t stop we will have a real fight she got embarrassed and left . And my dear god she did the unexpected she went and told my family the stuff that I did in the past and she completely ruined my relationship with them . And I can not look to them in the eyes after them knowing how much of a mess I was ….",1
"Recently I (59/m) purchased a bicycle for my grand daughter (3) at the suggestion of my daughter (her mother). We used a popular online shopping venue's gift list to pick one we were agreeable on. Being excited for my first gdaughter brings my wife and I great joy. Last night my daughter texted us to let us know her in-laws had purchased a bicycle for our mutual gdaughter and basically told us we could either keep our bike at our house or our gdaughter could have 2 bicycles. This infuriated me!. Instead of telling the other gfather that we had already purchased one, she basically told us to return ours. Backstory: this is the first grandchild in both families, we live in the same town and I make it a point to stop by to see my gdaughter anytime I can and especially when I'm invited (pretty much drop everything). Her other gfather comes by to see her maybe once a month. This past weekend, my daughter had to take her other child to the ER, my wife and I dropped everything (we were 40 minutes away) and sped to the house to watch our gdaughter while our D and SiL could take the other child to the ER. We then spend all day saturday watching the children and helping move furniture at my D's house. To add to it, my wife is basically the full time nanny fo rour gchildren while my D works. Back to why I'm hurt - i NEVER once tried to make this a competition between gparents, but my daighter has put me in this position. So as i see it, i have 3 options, 1 - give the gift as originally planned, and keep it at our house or theirs, 2 get my gdaughter something else and donate the bicycle, or 3 give her the bicycle ahead of christmas and let the other gfather deal with giving her the second one. So, what say ye? AITA for over-reacting and expecting my daughter to stand up to her in-laws?",1
"This might seem quite straightforward in the title, but let me tell you what happened.

Me and my friend were starting to get into hockey about 4-5 months ago and started practicing with U14 team. He would show up every time and me too and all was well. Then, the season ended and we got into U16. His attendance started to grow less and was getting quite sporadic. When you would ask him what he was doing, he was always simply busy and said his family was having dinner with another family and he had to go. He was also always helping his grandfather (I assume with building something because he told me he has often made something with his grandpa in his grandpa's workshop).

This Sunday, there were two practices, one in the morning and one later in the day. Then a friend group went out after I had went to the late practice. We had a good time and then I brought up, ""Hey -friend-, why didn't you go to practice this morning?"" 

He said, ""I was helping grandpa."" And so I replied, ""Maybe you should consider that maybe you don't have time to practice hockey."" I'd like to think that I was friendly and just bringing it up. But he got a bit hostile answering, ""Dude, it's not like I don't want to practice hockey."" I said, ""Well I know that, but if you don't have time, why waste the money you know?"" At this point he was getting quite angry saying, ""Don't talk about something you know nothing about."" I was distraught with the answer and I just replied ""What?"". He then exclaimed ""Do you even know what I'm helping grandpa with?"" I said ""No, I don't."" And I looked at him expecting some elaboration. But he said nothing and was quiet for the rest of the night and I said at the end, ""You know what I said wasn't personal or badly meant (rough translation)."" And he was visibly annoyed and just said sternly, ""We don't need to talk about it.""

In hindsight, maybe his grandpa needs some help due to health problems or something like that and that's why he got defensive. If there is a lack of context, I can't really provide any more because I don't know the relevant context myself. It just seemed so out of the blue about what I thought was a normal topic.

I know this is maybe minor in your eyes, but I want to know if I overstepped any boundaries. AITA?",1
I 26 (f) have had a best friend since I was in kindergarten. We have been close for years and she is like a sister to me. I feel like when she got married she’s been more distance and I barley know here husband.  When I found out I was pregnant she was more involved and came to most of the events and made an effort after she was born for a few months but now I don’t see her much anymore. It was recently my daughter’s first birthday and my best friend couldn’t make it because it was her nephew’s first birthday party that weekend as well. I was livid and hurt I just feel like my daughter has been pushed aside by her husband family and I thought she would play a bigger role in my daughter’s life. She’s even her nephews god mother and for years we talked about her being my children’s god mother. AITA ,1
"On mobile and throwaway because my daughter uses Reddit. 

My 50m daughter f20 is in college and stays at her m21 boyfriends a lot which me and my wife do not like very much. We let her do what she wants nonetheless. She pays for her own tuition and works plus pays for all of her own things minus we pay for rent, we have a room for her and she does live with us. She asked if her boyfriend could come sleepover too so that she could feel more comfortable staying at home more often. We said absolutely not. She was upset because she said it was her own room and that she has been dating him almost 3 years. We just will not allow it under our roof and she threatened to move in with him. We really want her to continue living here but do not want them sleeping together under our roof (we do not like it with her there either but she is an adult). We have a pretty good relationship so this has been hard for us. 

So AITA?

Edit: My wife and I discussed it a bit and we currently are thinking we can put an air mattress next to her bed if they leave the door a bit cracked, I understand we are the assholes, it is just hard changing our beliefs. We love her and she has really been disconnecting from us and not coming around at all.

Edit: our son already moved out and into an apartment with his girlfriend, he does not come around often

Edit: my daughter texted she found the post I will do an update once we talk

Edit: We spoke, she is going to stay with her boyfriend more and will try to move out at the end of the semester, we said he could sleep on the floor or couch but not her bed. She said she understood and left. We are not on bad terms, she explained her point of view but we are not willing to compromise that far. Thank you all for the words of advice.

Last edit: My daughter moved out this week. She was going to stay longer but spoke to her therapist and decided it was healthier to leave. Thank you for all the messages",1
"I am getting married in June. I sent out my invitations in January to give everyone time to RSVP. 

We are having a destination wedding at a great resort in the Dominican Republic. 

Our invitations were expensive. And we thought it was a good place to economize if we only sent invitations to people who could afford to come.  

Right now my mom says she is very disappointed with me.  I've upset so many people.  My mom says that I was rude to judge people by their income. 

I didn't judge anyone. I just picked the people I thought could afford to go.  

AITA?",1
"A couple of weeks back I put in my CV and application for a position I don't actually want. I actually want a different position within the company, but I keep getting passed over for the job (permanent role that I'm already doing under a casual contract). So to make myself feel better, I put in for a role that I have over 20 years of experience doing. I tick all the boxes and had little doubt I'd get a nibble on the CV. In order to dissuade the employer from making me an offer, I put in an excessive salary expectation ($180,000/yr). Today I get a phone call with a request for an interview. So I inform my wife that this company actually called me back and are interested. I should point out that the high end of average salary for the position is $90,000/yr. I let the company know that I expect my requested amount because I'd be leaving a high-pay job and would need to make it worth my time as well as I'd be working away from home and need to rent an apartment as well as pay my current mortgages. They weren't scared off by my request. F*ck! Now I need to consider this. 

Here's where things go pear-shaped at home. I haven't committed to anything yet and I'm still doing some soul-searching as to if I want to actually live away from home (I already spend half my time away from home, fly into work and then fly home after 2 weeks for 2 weeks back home). So my wife starts in on me telling me I need to get my housing paid for by the company as well as the $100/hr salary. I dismiss the discussion because I told her ""Let's see what they even have to offer before I decide on anything."" Then she starts to become insulting ""Well, if you take X amount and have to pay for rent, you're making less"" and ""you've been used in the past, I just need to know where your head is at."" After a couple of weeks of being spoken to like I require assisted living, or am incapable of managing myself on my time off I finally snap and say ""I'm not your daughter! I don't need a coach! I don't need you to do the math for me when I can probably crunch the numbers better than you! I've had this career longer than your youngest daughter! I don't need you to negotiate my career for me! I told you to wait to see what they even offer!"" Sne says, ""Fine, I won't talk to you!"" To which I reply, ""Good! Shut up and f*ck off!""

I've been calming down for about an hour now, but I'm pretty sick of the constant criticism and ongoing condescending suggestions.  AITA? Probably, most likely. But I'm at wits end here. How do I get things to change around here?",1
"My husband rented his aunts home before we got married. He signed a month to month lease when he moved in. I moved in with him after our marriage because the rent was super cheap. 
My parents recently came to me asking if they could park their RV at our home.
I didn’t see a problem with this. Our yards are really big and there is space.
Because of city ordinance the RV has to be parked in the back yard. There was no RV gate in the fence. My husband went to his aunt and asked if we could install a rv gate? His aunt said no. My husband relayed the message to me and my parents seemed upset when I told them. 2 days ago. I came home from work and saw that my dad had a construction crew at our home and had removed part of the fence for the gate. There was a apple tree in the way. They couldn’t fit the RV in the yard. My husband angry told my dad not to continue and that they needed to repair the fence.
At this point I felt like it was pointless. The fence guys already built the columns for the gate. It would cost a lot more money to rebuild the fence. I told my dad to finish the job but make sure it was left super clean. That it looked nice. I planned on talking to the aunt later and explain what happened.
What I didn’t know was my dad told the guys to remove the tree. 
My husbands aunt came by and saw the tree cut down and started to cry. She has refused to talk to my dad or me. When my husband came home he found a 30 day notice on our door.
Terminating our lease. He tried to call his aunt and she didn’t answer the phone. He then called my MIL and she went to talk to our aunt.
Later I got several messages calling me an A for cutting down the aunts late husbands tree. I had no idea he planted the tree. Now my husband and his whole family are really angry at me. I never told them to remove the tree. I feel like I am being thrown under the bus here. Am I the A here?",1
"I (25m) am in a bit of a pickle here. I met one girl (22f) we had 5 d ates but hadn't yet discussed exclusivity, my friend is getting married in a few weeks (was weeks ago I asked her to be my plus 1 and she accepted , but its out of town so she had to buy a plane ticket (I'm a broke grad student and could only afford my own and the hotel room, it's a destination wedding) plus she took off work

However I shortly met this other girl (26f) who I just got it off with right away, nothing wrong with previous girl I just had a much stronger connection with second girl and we had 3 dates and became exclusive. My plan was to break it off with first girl after wedding because she already forked over the cost and I can't afford to reimburse her, and plane tickets are nonrefundable or transferable (even if they were id feel like a huge dick asking her to transfer it to another girl). 

But I don't want to cheat on new excl partner so I told first girl I have covid but ""should be better by the wedding"" and I'll just tell her I don't feel well enough to be intimidate (so I don't cheat on my girl), then break it off with her after. 

But I (stupidly) took new girl to meet some buddies of mine who are also going to the wedding and they opened their big mouths asking her about being there, obviously she had no idea what we were talking about. 

I had to come clean and explain the situation, she's upset with me and thinks I should just ditch the other girl but I agreed to this before I met her and I can't afford to reimburse her for the plane tickets, but I showed her the texts claiming to have covid (so she wouldn't get suspicious as to why I wasn't meeting with her) to prove I wasn't cheating. 

My girl is giving me an ultimatum that she'll break up with me if I don't make her my plus 1, but I already am tied down to my first plus 1 

AITA? If so how do I un-asshole myself?",1
"My dad likes to bother me for having childish interests. I collect Lego. I watch animated movies. I date people who are into cosplay like I am. Etc.

Yes I do all that stuff. I am also 35 with a career. I own my own home. Well me and the bank for now. I played a fairly rough sport at an intercollegiate level. I am pretty comfortable with my masculinity and find his lack of understanding more amusing than hurtful.

I was over at his place with my girlfriend and we were talking about Netflix because he uses my account and they are getting fucky about it. I said that Disney+ was still okay to use and he started in on me for watching kids shows. Him and my mom watch the old tv shows and the nature shows on it.

He is an ass so he asked my girlfriend if i did cosplay as a girl.

She is not as used to him as I am and I had to move the conversation along before she started something.

So I convinced him to watch a movie with us so I could show him why I enjoyed the movies. I chose UP.

He would not shut up during the beginning when the kids met. But he was intent during the part with no dialogue.

Him and my mom were both crying at the end when the old guy was sitting alone on the steps to his house.

I paused it and asked him if he needed a hanky. He called me an asshole and got up and left. My mom said there was stuff in that scene that probably brought up bad feelings for him. She did not elaborate.

I apologized to him. And then I asked if he understood that the ""cartoons"" I watch are multi layered and aren't just for kids. He said he understood but he is still upset that I mocked him for crying.

He has had no problem belittling me for my choices for over 20 years but he is butthurt because I made fun of his emotions.

"I(31F), hubby (34M) and our kids have spent a week with my in-laws at their place. SIL's family lives close by, so we spend time with them as well.
In-laws are cool, we get along great.
My SIL's hubby (40M) is an ass.
He's loud, he takes up a lot of space and his idea of ""fun"" is to embarrass/shame others, especially if they don't act ""like their should for their gender"".

No one gets away, not even his wife or kids. His boys are not allowed to wear pink or do any ""girly shit"", his daughter must ""act like a lady"" and was refused to pursue the education she wanted (car mechanic).

We don't have a ""traditional"" marriage.
I do maintenance on our cars when needed, same with our garden and house, I fix whatever needs fixed in and outside the house etc etc. Basically everything men would be expected to do a few years back. 
Hubby does lots of the daily house chores.
BIL often make jabs at me for not being feminine enough, and hubby for not being ""manly"" enough.
""A housewife shouldn't be covered in dirt and oil like that"", ""a dress would look pretty on that body of yours instead of whatever it is you're wearing"", ""maybe your husband should step up for once so you don't break a nail"" and similar comments.

It obviously pisses me off. I have promised hubby not to confront him in public so I haven't. I have talked to him in private but he just brushes me off calling it some good ol' banter between in-laws.
SIL says nothing, ever.

Our oldest kid have not promised anyone not to confront him in public, though.
A few of evenings ago we were sitting in their living room after dinner, chatting and having a good time. 
I got up to get myself a beer, hubby asked for a cider.
BIL immediately drew his breath and I knew it was coming. 
""When you didn't think the roles could be more reversed!""

Our daughter (F13) looked up from the board game she was playing with her cousins, stared at him and asked ""what do you mean, reversed roles?"".
She looked at me but I didn't say or signal for her to drop it in any way.

The rest went along the lines of

BIL: oh, it's just something we adults say as a joke.

D: *looks around at everyone else*
Huh. I thought jokes were supposed to make people laugh. No one's laughing. 

BIL: Well, some people just don't get the joke. 

D: or maybe they just don't find it to be funny. Not everyone gets off on sexist comments and ""jokes"". 

BIL: oh, we're using big words, now! *He actually started to laugh, albeit nervously*

D: do you need me to explain sexism to you? The boys in my class also laugh and goof around when subjects they're not mature enough to comprehend comes up. 

At this point BIL huffed, got up and left the room, clearly pissed off. 
Things were tense for a couple of minutes, then we were back to having a good time. 
Hubby later that evening got a text from BIL saying he should get his kids and wife(!!) under control, and teach the kids to respect their elders (fuck that). 
Shit went down the following days, the family is split 50/50. 

So AITA for not telling her to keep quiet?



Edit/info(?):
Yes, we ignore his comments. When he doesn't get a reaction/the attention he wants, he stops and the remainder of the gatherings are awesome. 
I've known BIL for 16 years, hubby has known him for 25. Everyone has at one point tried calling him out but it doesn't work. 
Ignoring is more efficient although he just *have* to make a comment before he realize no one's listening. 

We have talked to our kids about this as well, that his behavior obviously isn't okay but if no one gives feedback he'll drop it.


*Final edit:*

*Alright, hubby and I have had a serious long talk, after showing him the comments on this post. 

We see that we're TA's for subjecting our kids to BIL (not what this AITA was about but Reddit speaketh the truth once again), even though they know his behavior is not okay. 
We honestly thought talking to them about it, explaining our reasoning behind ignoring and not bother to confront etc was enough.
We realize we were in the wrong, and we will talk to the kids about it and how we should've (and will in the future handle) handled it. 

It will most likely be 6-9 months until we see SIL and the in-laws again.
We have already now decided that whenever he makes his comments we will just up and leave. No explanation, just take the kids with us and whoosh. 
If that doesn't work after a repetition or two, we will inform in-laws that we will not attend gatherings etc where he will be present.

Going NC is as I already said a last resort. The kids (theirs and ours) goes along amazingly, I love spending time with SIL as we have a lot in common. 
I would very much hate to keep the kids from seeing each other, so hubby and I hope that our ""plan"" will work. 
It will take some time to find out since we don't see each other often. 
I'm fairly quick to say others should go NC when there's toxic family involved, and it's obviously easier said than done. 

Thanks everyone, for taking the time to reply.
Especially thanks to those with constructive feedback/comments.*",1
"I (17F) finished dinner and was walking back to my room, on my way my dad got my attention from the living room and did a motion to ask me to pick up from bowl from his lap - sometimes he asks and sometimes he doesn’t - and when I groaned and complained I asked, “Why can’t you just get up?” He looked at me annoyed and said, “What?” So I repeated my question. That got me a glare from my mum and a what I can only see as an annoyed and confused look from my dad. He mumbled something and started to move to get up, I looked over at my mum and said, “I didn’t hear him” to which I got a, “Rude” from my mum and my dad said, “Don’t worry about it” (I assume that what he said the first time). I didn’t think it was anything completely rude, maybe a normal teenager on her period bitchy, but my mum looked like I told him to f himself. So AITA?",1

I am in a friend group which includes 5 girls including me ( however its really 4 ) me and 2 other girls are in the same class ( Ill call them A and B ) I wasnt originally in that class but because i did well in my old class i advanced up.

A boy / Me / A / B  .
Me and the boy are on 1 table and A and B are on another table. We had a substitute in class today, so all we were gonna do is talk. Girl A turns fully to Girl B and talks to her for 1 hour straight mind u Girl A suggested i sit next to her. I then fall asleep because what else am i meant to do as you literally ignore me . Girl B does this thing which really irritates me , she starts calling me and i dont answer then she speaks in this really high pitched irritating voice and says ""how are you "" i obviously ignore her as she has spent 1 literally hour ignoring me and then asks if im okay.

"My (35M) sister died 3 weeks ago. My wife had only met her once since she lived quite far away and every time I went to see her my wife didn't come. My dad told me that she'd died and told me when her funeral was. I travelled down for the funeral and I told my wife I was going to see my sister, which wasn't really a lie.

A few days after I got back home my brother called my wife and told her to check up on me since I hadn't been answering his calls and texts. I guess she asked why he was so worried and my brother told her about my sister dying.

My wife got really upset at me for not telling her and she said that I can't trust her and that I should ""talk to her instead of bottling up my feelings."" I explained that I didn't tell her because I knew she'd worry and expect me to talk about how I feel. It's very sweet of her for worrying about me but she doesn't need to. It's like she doesn't understand that I don't talk about how I feel unlike her.

She's barely spoken to me since, she said that she feels betrayed. I didn't mean to uspet her so much I just didn't want to deal with her constant worrying. AITA?",1
"I (17m) have two sisters, Alice (29) and Miranda (33). I am much closer to Alice than I am to Miranda. Miranda is also not on good terms with our parents. Alice has four kids and is currently expecting child number five, while Miranda can’t have children which her ex divorced her for. Miranda is very successful in life, she has a nice apartment, works a good job and earns a decent amount of money. Alice, on the other hand, is struggling financially. She had her first kid right out of high school and got pregnant with her second child soon after, so she decided to become a SAHM to her children while her boyfriend provides for them.

Me and my parents try to help them out as much as possible, be it childcare or money, whatever she needs. I love my nieces and nephews. I take them to the park and play with the older ones, I really enjoy it. Miranda doesn’t help out with them, she says it’s because she’s too busy. Well, she works long hours, but she doesn’t have kids, so I don’t know what she does on weekends. She also doesn’t help out financially, which I find unfair, since she makes so much money and all she does is spend it on herself, although she does give us very nice gifts for Christmas and birthdays. My parents nag her about it, saying she should give some of her money to Alice monthly, and I agree with that.

So, here comes the part where I may have been an asshole. I was at Miranda’s place last week, as she baked muffins and invited me over to eat some and catch up. We got on the topic of Christmas presents and I told her some of the stuff I wanted. She nodded and said she would give our parents a coupon for a much needed vacation and Alice some clothes she had mentioned and also some new boots and jackets for her kids. I was a little stunned she didn’t have more for Alice, so I asked, “Why do you only get Alice the bare minimum? You can afford to help out more and you refuse to out of spite.”

Miranda looked at me and laughed. She said it wasn’t her business to feed six people, that Alice was old enough to make her choices and live with the consequences. She knew what she was getting herself into and that she wouldn’t pay Alice’s way through life just because she kept having children she couldn’t afford.

I was stunned at how cold she reacted. I asked her how she could live her life being so selfish and uncaring, and she got angry and told me, “Listen, kid, there are some thing you are way too young for to be discussing with me, and this is one of those. Drop the subject or get out.” I got really frustrated with her and said something I probably shouldn’t have. I told her, “No wonder your husband divorced you, even if you could have children, you would be a terrible mother.” Miranda got very quiet and told me to leave and never come back.

She has now blocked me on everything, and though I don’t agree with her not helping out, I’m starting to feel guilty for what I said. So, AITA?",1
"To start off, a little background. I was diagnosed with autism a few months ago, but I've displayed traits of neurodivergency since I was a little kid. One of these traits was a major dislike of certain tastes and textures, as well as not always behaving accordingly in certain social situations.  Not alot of my extended family knows bc I don't see them very often bc they live towards the North East of the country while I live down in the South East.
So, now, on with the story.
I, 17F, was at a family gathering with my extended family a few days ago. It was a big get-together with lots of different food and drinks. Around 5pm, a massive cake was brought out for everyone. It was a sponge cake, topped with whipped cream and various fruits. I knew I wasn't going to eat any of the cake bc whipped cream, strawberries and raspberries(which were on the cake) are some of the foods that agitate my sensory issues. I said out loud that I wouldn't like any and began to walk away. My cousin called after me and said that she worked really hard on it and it would be really disrespectful if I didn't even bother to try it. I tried to explain that I couldn't tolerate certain textures because of my autism, she said I was making up excuses and that I'm ""perfectly normal"" and just ""attention seeking"". I brushed her off and left the room and just chilled in the living room for a while. My mom took my cousin's side and said what I did was selfish and that I was using my ""disorder"" as a get out of jail free card. I went non-verbal until the next morning, and then that afternoon we drove home, where my mom grounded me for 2 days for how I treated my cousin.
So reddit, did I deserve my punishment? Am I The Asshole?

EDIT: Just to clarify a few things
1. When I say I spoke out loud, it wasn't like I yelled and then stormed off. I saw the cake and I said to myself ""oh I don't want any."" but it was a little louder than when I usually talk to myself and my cousin must've overheard.
2. I didn't see the cake until it had been in the room for maybe 10 minutes. This is because the cake was set on a table in the corner of the room and people were crowded around it taking slices. When I got a chance to take a piece I realised I didn't want any.
3. I didn't get up from a table and storm out of the room. We were all standing around the room and eating off paper plates. When I realised I didn't want any cake I just set the paper plate down , casually turned away and walked out of the room. ]
Also thank you to the people who informed me on the difference between being non-verbal and having selective mutism. I usually become unable to speak when I'm stressed, angry, embarrassed or upset and it's takes a while for my voice to come back and I know now that's called selective mutism.",1
" Ok first hey 👋 
I'm a 21 f. I live in Missouri it's not
like the most unwelcoming state to Igbta members but also not the greatest ya know. I like listening to a certain YouTube channel that read Reddit stories .
I'm a painter not like canvases but houses. So l'm in peoples lived in homes a lot. So Monday started super normal l've been working in this same house for a couple days it's a remodel and the homeowners are having their whole kitchen redone. For some reason that day I apparently didn't charge my AirPods all the way and they died half way through the day while I was listening to Reddit stories. I was super invested in the episode ( I can't remember the episode for the life of me l was listening to the reading Reddit stories marathon) it had to do with a same sex couple that's all I can remember.
Since both of the homeowners and the tile guy was gone I figured it wouldn't hurt for me to keep listening to it out loud. My mom who works with me (it's a family company) listened to murder podcasts everyday while the homeowners were still there. I'm working for about like three minutes listening to this story and without me realizing one of the homeowners comes home.
The story was mentioning the same sex couple.
The homeowner heard this and flipped. She accused me of bringing witch craft and sin in her house. Told me I was going to hell and said she wanted me off the job. So I just left I didn't I just left I didn't want to fight with the homeowner and lose the job for the company. My grandpa aka my boss called and told me if l'm listening to anything I have to put my headphones in. Everyone else in the company can listen to whatever they want out loud and the one time I don't I get in trouble. He said we have to keep the clients happy and I should have been more careful if I'm going to listen to something that involves Igbta things.
This is when i started getting pissed. He knows I'm bi but just doesn't acknowledge it (honestly that part doesn't bother me as long as l'm not being disowned lol). I let that lady berate me and put me down for the sake of the company and he tells me l have to just be more careful about it.
No apology for be treated like l'm the devil for listening to something that has anything to do with Igbta people. So I ended up snapping on him. I told him I hated him and he never treated me the same ever since I came out to him. That we used to be best buds and now I just see him as an ex boss. I hung up the phone and for the past couple days my family has been trying to get ahold of me. Some of them say I should apologize and make up others agree with me. I know I shouldn't have snapped out on him about it. I do understand they come from a different time and it's hard to accept all the new shit but I just can't help but be angry he can't love me the same way he used to. So AlTA for snapping out on my boss for listening to reddit stories at work?",1
"Hello Reddit. I come to you with my question because I myself am not sure where I’d stand morally if I decide to follow through with what I am about to present; 

Context: 70M is originally from El Salvador, M was born and raised in ES all his life up until 8 years ago when he immigrated legally to the US   

I (23M) have been taking care of my father (70M) for the past year and 2 months, following a stroke that left him paralyzed and bed bound. My father had his first born child, we’ll call him M (~40M) 20+ years before I was even conceived. M was not really present to help take care of dad. He works, and helps with rent, however, he would rarely come by to check on dad and see how he is doing. Last December, my dad got pneumonia and has been fighting for his life in the ICU since. My dad has property out in ES that, while in good health, he’d say those lands are M’s and the property here would be mine. 

Anyways, my dad is at the end of his life. There’s not much that can be done and well, I’ve been having to make all the arrangements, meetings with his doctor, all while still making ends meet to keep my home. 

Here is my AITAH question, would I be the ass hope for trying to fight legally to keep the lands out in ES? 

Everyone in the family is saying M does not deserve to inherit anything because he wasn’t there for my dad in the end… but also my dad was not a saint. He didn’t raise M. All he really left him were the lands, but even then my dads side of the family, as well as my mom, say that I should fight for full rights to those lands. 

Me personally, I feel like I have no business putting my hand on lands I’ve never seen or been on, but I’ve also been the only one between the two of us that was there for my dad. Even now, with him being in ICU, M continues to be flat out oblivious to the situation and doesn’t seem to care at all.",1
"Me (F27) and my husband (M28) had two beautiful twins six years ago. A few months after that we got married.

Last month my husband lost his job and since he doesn't even has high school finished he has been struggling to find a new one. I thankfully has been saving money ever since he started working so we have enough to sustain ourselves for some time. 

This morning I had breakfast with some friends so my husband took care of the kids. We live far from each other, so I warned my husband that I was going to be out for at least two hours. 

When I returned home, our sons came running to me to show me the new toys his dad bought them, along with backpacks full of stuff for school, which I found weird since they start school on August. I feared the worst and I went to check my savings, but everything was there.

I confronted my husband, who was on our bedroom, and asked him where did he got the money to buy that stuff. He told me he sold his wedding ring cause the kids asked him when would they buy their stuff for school and he panicked thinking he wouldn't have money for it (completely irrational, we still had more than three months to worry about that!). I was devastated, I couldn't believe he would so easily get rid of something that represents our marriage and I told him so. He broke down and said he just doesn't want to deny our sons a normal childhood but I told him that isn't an excuse for his irresponsibility. I told him I was going to return the backpacks and all the other stuff to see if I can get the ring back but he won't allow me to, and said that if I do that he'll buy everything back again. I couldn't talk more cause our sons entered the room and he hugged them, which annoys me cause it's as if he's skipping our discussion.

I needed to vent so I told my parents and my friends about what happened. My parents said I'm right on being angry but that they warned me nothing good was going to come out of marrying someone without a real job. I don't agree with them, but I do feel disappointed at his actions this last month. My friends on the other hand think I'm going too hard on him and that based on past stuff I've told them, he sounds like an extreme people pleaser.

AITA for the way I reacted? I'm deeply hurt by what he did. I think he was selfish and should've consulted me before doing something like that.

ETA 1: Some stuff that may be important

I don't work, me and my husband agreed I was going to take care of the kids and he was going to work.

He's studying for his GED.

He has been rejected from many works cause he doesn't have his diploma but that sounds suspicious. I think they just think he's undocumented like someone here suggested (he's Latino).

He has already sold stuff of his in the past to buy the kids stuff (clothing, food, toys, etc.)

~~I'll try to get the ring back, I already took the toys and backpacks from my sons~~ My husband begged me to not do this to our sons so I gave them the backpacks, toys and school supplies back. Some people were curious on what toys they were, it's some play doh, a table puzzle and some Lego. He says it can help them stay creative and train their memory.

ETa 2: Ok, I'll do this. If my husband doesn't get a job before this Friday I'll look for one for me myself. Happy?",1

MASSIVE UPDATE: I just want to thank everyone who has been kind and took to time to read through my comments, giving me advice. I just wanted to say I've read them. I had a big breakdown last night because I realized I was in way over my head with all this legal stuff. You guys were asking me to look up laws and probate and just so much stuff I don't understand at all. I was trying and furiously googling. In the end, I called my ex (he's a lot more savvy with this kind of stuff but I try not to intrude in his life) and had a bit of a cry while explaining everything that was going on with my dad's stuff, me being locked out, and just all the other drama with my sister. 

He said back when our son was born my dad gave him a copy of his will (since that was also around time my dad started getting sick). Long story short he found it this morning and the condo was left to US. There should also be an RESP for my son. IT IS SIGNED AND NOTARIZED BY A LAWYER!! He said he will help me through the process and that we can contact the lawyer together and my ex will help explain things to me. Also, as mentioned in the comments, when we divorced, my dad told me he was updating his will leaving the to condo me (I was not aware this was in reference to the fact that he had previously put my ex husband in the will), so we both expect there to be a new will. However, I know my ex and believe him when he says that if there isn't  he won't try to take anything. 

My spirits have been lifted and I am very hopeful this could all work out. I'm already day dreaming of having my son back home with me!!! 

Again, thank you so much to those who took the time to give advice. Without your encouragement I wouldn't have had the guts to contact my ex. Just THANK YOU!

I'm 28f. She's 32f. Don't know if that matters.

Recently our father passed away. He didn't really leave any money but he has a partially paid for condo which I desperately wanted to live in. it's nothing fancy. Just a small 650 square foot 2 bedroom place. It's cozy. I've been struggling with homelessness since my husband and I split. Rents have drastically increased, I'm talking over doubled since I was on my own last. I can't afford anything. The cheapest 1 bedrooms are 1800 a month. Bachelor's around 1500. After taxes I make just under 2000.

I want to assume my dad's mortgage which is right around $600 every month. I asked my sister, pled my case and she didn't take it so well. She's not hurting for money. Owns multiple properties all over the world. I even said that if we can make it that if anything were to happen to me she could still get half. I'd want my half to go my son which is also the reason I don't want to move somewhere cheaper. 

My ex husband let's me visit outside their place whenever I want. If I had my own place with a suitable bedroom for our son we'd be splitting custody 50/50.

Anyways, sister and her husband have sent me a barrage of angry texts calling me a greedy asshole. Curious about reddit opinion.

Please be gentle.",1
" I had a really bad depressive episode around 1 year ago and the anxiety got so bad that I couldn’t leave the house unaccompanied. I started counselling in November and I can do things on my own like go to the gym and stuff without anyone and leave the house. Which is massive progress saying the least. 

My mum has been supportive and was happy when I started going out alone but she said she feels sad she can’t come with me but I do have to learn at some point. I distanced myself from old friends because they were fake and my anxiety kind of took over. I with my own courage and help of therapy got in touch with a friend and even met up with her which is again great progress as I haven’t socialised in a year. My therapist said that’s a big step and I was brave and my mum was so happy too. This was last week

However she was talking about a famous person who was independent and did most things alone (and she said like you), and then her mum forced her to do things and she values friends because they gave her confidence and advice and she has a social life now. It’s kinda tiring to hear because I already crave friends and then my mum said you don’t talk to anyone. She later explained that I talk to people and stop shortly and I shouldn’t repeat that. But for me it seemed that she’s dismissing my efforts and showing concern for my social life giving me more panic, and it felt like she’s saying whatever I’ve done isn’t enough.

I kinda got very angry at her started shouting saying you don’t care how what you say makes my anxiety worse. But she has accompanied me to appointments and takes me on walks so I feel like an AH ",1
"I (30m) moved in with my gf (28f) about six months ago. Before we moved in together I had a little Friday ritual of getting coffee and a bagel from a place near me. Once we moved in together my gf joined in on this ritual of getting a Friday morning breakfast. 

Last Friday we got into a fight because for the second week in a row I had gone and gotten breakfast without getting her anything. For context she works a hybrid schedule and sometimes goes to clock in at the office and is gone for about an hour. That morning I had gotten up with her already gone and assumed she would be gone for a while so got myself breakfast. She came home and got mad that I had done this two weeks in a row. I said I didn’t know when she would be home and she responded saying I have a phone and should have texted her asking. It turned into a whole thing and I apologized.

Well today I woke up groggy. My gf had had a panic attack at 4:30am and I woke up and comforted her for about 20 mins. When i woke up again she was gone to drop off her key at her parents (they’re watching our cats this weekend) and clock in. I got up and went to Starbucks. When I got back to my car after getting my food and drink I saw she was calling me. She was locked out of our house because she’d given her parents her key. I told her I would be home soon and hung up. I then realized I should ask if she wants something from Starbucks so I called her back asked. She asked if I’d already ordered. I said yes but that I would go back in for her if she wanted something. She got quiet and said no she didn’t want anything.

When I got home she was mad at me for not thinking of her. I told her I did think of her and that’s why I called and she said I wouldn’t have called if she didn’t call me first. She thinks I’m in the wrong because I didn’t think of her before ordering but I honestly didn’t even really think of this Friday morning breakfast as “our thing.” Plus I did call her and ask what she wanted so I did think of her. She said her big want from me is to be more considerate of her which she has been saying for a little while now. AITA?

TLDR: my gf and I have a habit of getting a friday morning breakfast but I didn’t get her anything 3 weeks in a row.

I may be the asshole because we did just have a fight about this and I genuinely don’t know if I would have thought of her if she hadn’t called me first.",1
"I’ve been diagnosed with cancer and started preparing for the possibility of my death. We are a family of four: me, my wife, and my daughters R(27) and V(25). R lives with us. She is autistic, needs 24/7 care, medications and therapy. V has been estranged since she was 19. She didn’t have an easy time growing up with a severely disabled sister that took almost all our money/time. We made a lot of mistakes and let her build up a lot of anger and resentment and when we realized it, it was too late.

Our finances are limited. I am the only one working - wife cares for R. All I have to leave in my will is the house, my car and 40k I put together here and there, and I know I have to leave all to R. Unlike V, she will never be able to work, and my wife will need every last dollar to give her the best care and quality of life possible. Guilt breaks me, but they just need it. 

V accepted to meet me for the first time in 6 years. She blew up on me. She said she thought I would apologize, but all I cared for was to ensure R’s inheritance. I *never* said it. She told me not to worry, that she never expected to get anything anyway, and that if I only wanted to tell her that everything was once again going to R and tell her to suck it up our conversation was over. I begged her to calm down, said that I can’t give her money, but if she wants *anything* else… She said she doesn’t trust me, that I never keep my promises, because R comes first and after we’re done there’s nothing for her. I told her I’ll prove her wrong, but she asked for Dado’s ashes. 

Dado was the family’s dog, but R always considered him *her own* dog. V was his “real” owner. She fed, bathed, trained, walked him and cleaned after him. She got a job at 15 to pay for his expenses. 

She wanted to take Dado to college. We already had a strained relationship. She said that since we kept forgetting a daughter she didn’t trust us with a dog. R had a total crisis. She started screaming, biting, defecating and urinating everywhere for days, and other things. We *had* to leave Dado at home. 

Dado died two months later. We didn’t notice that R had let him off the leash. He ran into the road and got hit by a car. This was the last straw for V. She said that she had spent her life sacrificing everything for R, even the money her grandparents left her as inheritance for college and that we took away for R’s expenses, but Dado’s life for R’s happiness was too much. She never came back home and blocked us everywhere for 6 years.

At home I tried to suggest giving V the ashes, but R reacted horribly. Her therapist suggested *not* taking “her dog” away now that there were already going to be a lot of changes in her life. 

I tried to call V, but she just hung up on me without even letting me explain and blocked us everywhere again. I am feeling like shit, my wife has not stopped crying. I feel like I lost my last chance of having my daughter back. AITA?",1
"I'm 30 next year, and a three year relationship broke down in May. As you can imagine, been a rough and weird first Christmas without them.

My aunt is almost 60 and unmarried. She is quite peculiar and gets hyper about a lot of things.

When we went to visit her today for Christmas her FIRST question was ""well any new man yet?"" 

I immediately replied ""well what about you, how come you aren't married yet?"" 

She stayed quiet for a LONG time and the rest of my cousins, my mum and aunts carried the conversation.

On the way home my Mum told me I was rude to answer that way, she was just taking an interest and making conversation. AITA for my reply?",1
"My brother and his partner are on a two week kid-free cruise. They left their 8yo son (Mateo) with me. I'm his favorite uncle and love him as if he were my own.

Last night, he fell asleep in my bed while watching a movie. When we woke up, I took selfies of him and I making silly faces to post on my Instagram account.

I got a ton of positive comments from family and friends.

Today, my brother's partner asked me to take all the photos of Mateo. I was like WTF? He said I had zero business posting pictures of him without asking for permission. I told him that he was crazy. They literally trust me enough to have him for two weeks. He said that's not the point. The point was that my nephew was not wearing a shirt and in another picture he's kissing me on the cheek.

My brother got involved and asked me to take them down until he talks with his partner. He has no issue with the pictures so I'm not taking them down.",1
"Been happily married for 13 years now, but found out that some family members thought it wasn't cool that they couldn't come to my wedding. Curious to hear the sub's take on it.  
  
I'm the middle of 5 kids.  We're all grown and moved up and out across four different cities.  When my wife and I got married, we agreed we didn't want a giant wedding.  She invited her parents and her two siblings and their families (two spouses, one kid).  I invited my parents, but I told my four siblings that while I understood I was asking a lot for them to attend a wedding 2,000 miles away, I wanted all of them there or none of them there.  
  
I have a hangup for things being ""fair"", plus I didn't want to have any ill feelings towards anyone that couldn't make it.  Like if they all showed up except one, I wouldn't like that.  There'd always be a ""well you didn't come to my wedding"" gremlin floating around.  (It's stupid I know, and I should be able to get over it, but I know myself well enough to know that wasn't likely.)  
  
So two said they could come, and two said they couldn't.  They honored my request and only (edit: my) parents attended.  (edit: Her parents, two siblings, their spouses, and one kid also attended.) We had a lovely wedding in a state park, followed by a reception/party in that city, and then another in my parent's state where I grew up and still have many friends.  All my siblings were able to attend that party and it was nice.  
  
A year ago or so one of my siblings casually mentioned how I was a jerk for not letting them come to my wedding.  I thought they were joking, but they were like ""That was kind of a dick move.""  
  
I feel like NAH, but I'm curious what you guys think.  
  
EDIT: Okay, it looks like I was indeed the asshole.  Thanks for the feedback.",1
"Let me set the stage. My sister and her boyfriend are going to the high schools Valentine’s Day dance called “Sweethearts.”  Since it’s a dance, my parents wanted to take pictures of my sister and her boyfriend and their group before hand. So we’re at home and my parents are messing with the camera. 

Now I used to do year book when I was in high school 3 years ago as a photographer for the school, so I asked if I could set the camera up so they could get better pictures. My sister (who’s been using the camera for an unofficial journalism club the school has) said I could, and I was messing with the settings to take some practice photos of my sister and her boyfriend. 

My dad asked me if I could help my mom take the pictures at the location they were going to and I said yes. But he didn’t tell my sister this. She and I don’t have a great relationship, mostly because when she got into middle school and especially high school, a lot of teachers and coaches associated her with me, basically knowing who she was because I had told them about it. We live in a small town, and not that many people have my families last name so it’s hard to put two and two together especially since I was told I was a good student, and I did three different sports while in high school. 

To add to this, she doesn’t like me being around her friends because of more or less the same thing. A lot of her friends know me through their siblings and she doesn’t really like that. 

So after I get the photo settings good for INDOOR shooting, I start packing up the camera to go to the location, but my sister gets really upset by this and doesn’t want me to come. She, my mom and her boyfriend get into my mom’s car and go off and I just go play call of duty now cause I didn’t think I was needed anymore. I assumed my sister or my mom would just set the camera back to automatic or something and take the photos that way. 

But they didn’t do that. I didn’t have my phone on me and I didn’t hear it ring. My mom called me four times to try to get help with the camera, and like 7 text messages, but I didn’t see them. 

When my mom got home from my sisters photo shoot and yelled at me for messing with my sisters cameras settings before the shoot, saying it’s my fault the pictures aren’t going to turn out good and she had to use here phone. Apparently they spent 20 minutes trying to reset the camera settings so she could take pictures. I said it’s not my fault and she replied with “if I hadn’t messed with the settings when I knew my sister wouldn’t let me come this wouldn’t have happened.” I guess I should’ve known my sister wouldn’t let me come. AITA for that?",1
"(PLEASE READ TO THE MOST RECENT UPDATE, THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED AND ALL IS WELL.)

I feel like shit right now, but i have to get this off my chest. my friend (who we’ll call Lily) and I were recruiting people from our sports house to do events at our school athletics carnival this year. it isn’t compulsory to do events or even go, but we needed names, so it was Lily’s idea to sign up random people for random events so we could fill up spaces to please the teachers/organisers.

Lily and my other friend (who we’ll call Clover) don’t like each other for whatever reason, so Lily thought it would be a good idea to sign Clover up for one of the events, and then Lily said to me “Take the blame for this, she hate me even more, please?” I thought that Clover wouldn’t care too much about it, so I did.

one of her friends is in one of my classes ended up telling me what happened to Clover because she wasn’t there the day of the athletics day (i’m also friends with her, let’s call her Amalia) turns out she was really upset and the whole reason that she didn’t go was because of her being signed up to an event that she apparently couldn’t do, and she wasn’t there when we were recruiting so she couldn’t defend herself, i told her the truth and that it was Lily’s idea to sign Clover up to events, and now i’m not sure what’s going on between us now because Clover has removed me from her private instagram and i’m afraid she’s removed me from her close friends story (teenage girl stuff lol).

i feel like Lily has thrown me under the bus, and i feel like i’ve thrown her under the bus, and now i might ruin 2 friendships which with one i’ve had for 3 years…give me advice please, and please tell me if ITA…

QUICK UPDATE: This update is about Lily, since i’ve gotten a few comments saying that she’s petty (my mum has said this once before, i’ll go into detail here tho):

Lily has been a student leader at my school for 3 out of 4 years that we’ve been at our school (so teachers like her), when i’ve applied to SL (and obviously been turned down) she once said to me  “I’m so sorry you didn’t get it, you were super close though!” with this tone that i cant really describe but its basically like a shit-eating grin but in a speaking sense? (SO SORRY I CANT DESCRIBE IT 😭😭😭) she’s gotten into smart kid subjects, and she has supporting family, so i’m not sure what she has to be petty about?The other girls (even ones not from our sports house) have strong opinions on her, and some don’t seem to be so positive.

reddit, i’m not too sure what’s going on right now, i mean i’m only 15 and this is getting a lot for me to process..continue to be honest, but it sort of does hurt. (i guess i now know the saying truth hurts?) lol.. anyways...Lily isn’t in my friend group (as in she doesn’t hang around with the group of people i usually do), so i’m going to take a break from talking to her and focus on myself and my mental health and my other friends.

UPDATE 2: guys, Clover  wasn’t too mad at me! she thought that the school ended up signing her up to the event. she did feel betrayed in a sense (which was totally valid) but she said she felt silly for the way she felt. she said it wasn’t that serious, and she appreciates the apology. we are all kids, and we are still learning as you already know. thanks reddit, this issue is now resolved with Clover!

onto Lily, i’m going to keep our friendship going for now until she does something else this bad (which i need to think before getting myself into this) this is all my mum’s advice, and i trust her the most to make sure i’m ok. she is a genuine nice person who has done really nice things for me.

"  
My husband has 2 kids from a previous 9f and 7m. The kids have been with my husband 100% of the time since my husband and his ex broke up. She has not been very involved in their lives since the youngest was just a year old. They do not have a relationship with their mom, however, her mother and grandmother do visit the kids, but not often. I’ve known the kids since they were 3 and 5.   


  
I’ve traveled a lot during my childhood and as an adult. It’s something that the kids are really interested in. I go on vacation multiple times a year and unfortunately, my husband and the kids could never travel with me outside the US. The kids need a letter of permission to travel abroad, which was hard for us to get since his ex never answered his emails.  


  
My family and I have been planning a trip to Paris and Kyoto to visit my maternal grandmother and paternal grandparents for Christmas and New Year. My entire family is going on this trip, my parents, in-laws, siblings, cousins, nieces, and nephews. We’ve been planning this trip for over 2 years and we finally bought our plane tickets after my son was born eight weeks ago. My husband’s ex has also signed the letter of permission, so everything is already in order for the trip.   


  
Last weekend my husband’s ex sent him an email regarding our trip. She basically asked if we could cancel our trip, so the kids could spend Christmas with their great-grandmother. Their great-grandmother is supposedly ill and they’re not sure if she’s going to be here next year.  
My husband immediately wanted to reject that idea, but I asked him to think about it.  


  
I think it might be good for the kids to stay behind with their grandma. They’ll get to see their great-grandma for maybe for the last and they’ll also see their mom. I know the kids are very excited to travel abroad, but do think this is more important than Paris or Kyoto. Both are just cities they won’t go anywhere and we can visit in summer. I told my husband all of this and he argued that we’d probably not get the money back we already spend. I told him that we bought business-class plane tickets and I know we’ll get that back.   


  
My husband just got angry and told me that we’re not going to discuss it anymore. My parents and siblings are on his side, but I feel like they’re only looking at the money. When I was a kid my parents also left my siblings and me in Kyoto with my grandparents to go on a trip. At the time I was also angry about it, but as an adult am very happy that I got to spend that time with my grandparents.   


  
I think this is also the case for the kids. They probably won’t be happy about it now, but will really appreciate it when they’re older. My husband disagreed with this and told me I was not looking at the kids’ situation and was angry when I again suggested canceling their trip. AITA?",1
"


My f31 sister f23, moved in with me and my husband m29 a week ago. She does not contribute money but takes on lots of house chores as a way to compensate for it. She'd cook, clean, organize, vacuum..etc.


Yesterday, I was at work and came home and found that she'd done my husband's laundry. I was stunned as I felt this was...not her place nor was it appropriate because for one I always do his laundry and more importantly, I did not think it was appropriatr for her to be looking at his under wear. She downplayed the whole thing saying it was no big deal and that she saw that I was struggling with work and then kids and wanted to help me by doing the laundry. I told her she shouldn't have done it but my husband didn't react and she used that to support her argument saying no one thinks it's a big deal except me. We argued and she shut me down then started crying saying she meant well and was trying to help out. But I couldn't help but think this was not her place.


My husband told me to drop it but I can't shake this weird feeling I got. He told me I should apologize to her for berating her but I refused.",1
"For context, I'm the type of person you'd never guess is mexican. I'm the white mexican type of thing, blue eyes, blonde, pale. My name and last name being of dutch origin doesn't help either. I rarely say im mexican although I am, people usually take a look at me and label me as white. I speak, write, and read perfect Spanish.

I'm a vet, I'm currently using ""VRE"" which is like the GI bill. A case worker is assigned to your case and guides you along, files paperwork etc. Right when I met him I knew he wasn't US born, most likely immigrated to the US, joined the military as many do. Figured it since he had a strong Spanish accent 

Well, about 2 wks ago he sent me 3 documents and ghosted me. I kept sending email after email asking for updates and if he needed anything else from me. Today, after about 25 emails he finally answered. I asked how the money for my school books work and he said, ""I cant do anything until you talk to the vet center"".  At this point im pissed he had absolutely never told me I needed to do that even after I sent countless emails asking for updates. 

We started arguing via email. I kept telling him this was his job, he had done this probably a million times how tf was I supposed to know I had to do that if he never said anything about it? 

He kept saying things like ""I can't sign that paperwork on your behalf"" told him that wasn't the issue, the issue here was that he never told me shit about that which is his job. 

After some arguing I figured the language barrier was why he wasn't getting the point so in my next email I explained the situation in spanish. No English text, just an email from start to end in spanish. 

Guess he got offended. Got called racist by a couple friends. I seriosuly dont see how tf that's racist. 

TLDR: Case worker who didn't seem like he was understanding the issue after a while of trying to get my point across. Ended up explaining in spanish which I figured was his primary language due to his heavy spanish accent. Got called racist by friends",1
"I started a new job last month. At my previous employer, they were very lax and laid back. They had work sponsored beer Fridays at the end of every week, and they served beer at the work cafeteria, with a limit of one per person during the work day. That being said, I usually drank a Busch Light or an IPA every day with my lunch for the past 2.5 years.
 
&nbsp;
 
During the interview process at my new job, they asked me what I liked about my [then] current employer, and I mentioned that they were very lax and the interviewer said ""Not to brag, but we're known for having a very lax culture here as well. I would bet we're more laid back than your current employer"". This was a relief to hear. I'll skip past the boring parts, but after a few more interviews at this place, I got an offer and took a job. 
 
&nbsp;
 
Upon accepting the position, I was mailed a onboarding packet with the employee handbook. I read the handbook from front to back and didn't see anything about a no alcohol policy in the book. This along with the mention of a ""very lax work culture"" had me thinking not many things would change from a culture standpoint from my old job to my new one. 
 
&nbsp;
 
The first few weeks was a lot of training and the training usually ran over lunch, so they would provide us with a variety of sandwich options/pizza that were catered, as well as drink options (waters, sodas, juice, tea, coffee, etc.) so I would just help myself to whatever they provided. Later in the month, my boss scheduled a lunch at a restaurant with our vendor to introduce me to them and explain my new role, and at this lunch my boss was the first person to order a beer, and the rest of us followed suit. This was another good sign.
 
&nbsp;
 
Fast forward to last week, training was over and I was starting to settle into a routine and working more on my day to day tasks. That being said, I packed my own lunch, and included in my lunch was a Busch Light. I ate the first few lunches at my desk, undisturbed by anyone else. I didn't think anything of it. Eventually I was invited to eat lunch at the lunchroom upstairs, so I joined some colleagues upstairs for lunch. I unpacked my lunch and cracked open my Busch Light. Immediately I could sense a ""What the hell is this guy thinking"" vibe from my colleagues, but no one said anything. I brushed it off. Later that day HR stopped by along with my boss and called me into the HR office. They said what I did was unacceptable and that ""I'm lucky I'm not getting fired for that type of behavior."" I mentioned the vendor lunch and my boss shot me daggers. We ended the meeting with an agreement that I would refrain from drinking alcohol on the job again.
 
&nbsp;
 
The next day, my boss chewed me out for ""throwing him under the bus"" and asked me ""what the hell I was thinking"". I don't get the big deal, no grown adult gets drunk or even buzzed off one single beer with lunch. I was following his lead and thought it was acceptable! So much for ""lax"".",1
"I (M 39) have been married to my wife Stacey (F 30) for 5 years and we have 2 children together. I also share 3 children with my ex wife Hannah (F 37). Ever since Stacey and I got together she has made it very clear to me that my 3 children are mine and Hannah's responsibility, not hers. This has worked out well so far, but lately it has been taking a toll on me.

I pay Hannah child support every month, ever since Stacey had our first child she has demanded that I give her the same amount of money each month to keep things ""fair"". In addition, I have to pay for half of our joint household expenses (ie mortgage, utilities, food) and my own car. Stacey pays for the majority of expenses for our children. 

Here lies the problem. Stacey has never taking issues with having to care for mine and Hannah's children. She picks them up from school, takes them to activities, and ensures they have everything they need. However, anytime she purchases anything for them, she immediately sends me a Venmo request and demands I cover all expenses related to children that are ""not hers"". We recently went on a family vacation and she demanded that I pay for half of the portion for our children and all of the portion for Hannah's. I told her that all theses expenses are taking a hit in my finances and she didn't seem to care. She reiterated that my children are my responsibility.

To add insult to injury, she recently started contributing money to college funds for her kids, while Hannah and I have nothing saved for our kids' college. Hannah found out and asked that I start funds for our kids. When I talked with Stacey about this, she said this was fine, but I had to put the same amount of money in the funds she has set up for our kids.

I told Stacey I need her to start paying her fair share of expenses around our household. I cannot afford to pay child support, household expenses, and all these miscellaneous expenses that come up for my kids. It wouldn't hurt her financially, as she makes more than me and could easily spare some money. Stacey blew up and took our children to her parent's house and I haven't heard from her in a day and a half. Am I the asshole for demanding that she pay her fair share?",1
"My ex and I had an peaceful divorce. We co-parent our 3 children together and there haven’t really been many issues. My ex is getting married to Stephanie. I like Stephanie she has been great with my kids and makes my ex happy. My ex invited me to their wedding and I was happy for him. It was my day with the kids so it made sense for me to come was his reasoning. When I arrived at the wedding Stephanie thanked me for dropping the kids off and brushed me off. We had never had any issues before.

I explained that I was going to stay for the reception and she was very upset. I was confused because I assumed she knew I would be in attendance. It turned out she didn’t consider that I would actually accept the invitation. I told her that I was invited and since I took the 2 hour drive I would be staying for the entire duration. She didn’t like this response. Stephanie asked me to leave and I stood my ground. She went on to complain about my dress upstaging hers. My ex and former mother in law helped her to calm down and the wedding shortly began.

I thought that was the end of it, but later in private Stephanie accused me of trying to ruin her special day. She is convinced that I wanted to show off and make the wedding about my divorce. She said it was rude for me not to leave after the bride requested it because it was her special day. I told her that I am not responsible for her insecurities and once again reminded her that I have no interest in ”stealing” my ex back.

Edit: the dress is posted on my page and since this is a throwaway i don’t remember the random password i typed up. i will also be active on u/closureseekingex2",1
"My husband has been working really hard the last two years to advance at his company and he finally got the promotion he's been after. I'm really, really proud of him. His parents are too and wanted to take us all out to dinner to celebrate. My husband absolutely loves prime rib and there's only one place in our area that serves it so he picked that restaurant. Thing is- I'm not fond of steak. I'll eat it but very rarely. I prefer chicken or fish. I looked up the menu before leaving and right now they have a limited menu. The place had only one fish entree and two chicken entrees, and none of them sounded good for various reasons. I suggested that he pick someplace else so everyone can eat. He refused citing that we rarely get to go to this place but go to other places in our area regularly which is true, but those places have lots of variety so everyone can eat.

He suggested that I ask if they could prepare the fish or chicken without the marinades or sauces but I didn't want to be difficult for the kitchen staff. His next suggestion was that I order dessert while everyone else ate entrees and then when we were done, he would take me where I wanted so I could eat dinner while he and the kids ate dessert. So I opted to just not go because I didn't want to sit there not eating and not having a good time while everyone else was. My husband asked me to go so he could celebrate with the people most important to him. I told him no again and that he needed to get going before he was late. He did go but came back a little over an hour later with the kids and they all had to go boxes. He said he couldn't think of what to tell the kids about why I didn't go when they kept asking without lying or making me sound bad so he just got an order for them to go and let the kids spend some time with their grandparents talking in the parking lot. I told him he should had stayed but he said that I put him in a bad spot with the kids and that I knew he wanted everyone there and that I should've just gotten over my picky eating for one night. I maintain if he really wanted us to all eat dinner as a family then he should've picked a restaurant with a more accomodating menu.

AITA?

Update: Some of these comments were pretty harsh but a kick in the pants. I've apologized profusely to my husband and I am going to take him to that restaurant this weekend and buy him some camping gear he's been eying as a start to making it up to him and changing course.",1
"Hi Reddit! I’m not sure if what I’m feeling is correct and I need help. To make a long story short, there was a falling out in my friend group when my boyfriend-at-the-time was rude to one of my friends-at-the-time. My friend-at-the-time then told me I should not have to make compromises in a relationship. I told her I was okay with my compromises as she is okay with hers. She then told me she had no compromises in her relationship, but I then pointed out that her boyfriend lives two hours away from her and driving is a compromise. She then blocked me and we have not spoken for four months. This person was introduced to me through one of my good friends, after her and my good friend had recovered from a falling out that took a couple years for them to bounce back from (they used to be friends, did not speak for two years, and I met this now-ex-friend through my good friend after they were back on speaking terms). Now, my personal issue has come about due to FOMO; I’m wondering if I would be the asshole to tell my other good friends that I would be offended if they hung out together with my ex-friend without me? I totally understand hanging out one-on-one together and just wanting to see that friend. This ex-friend has made it explicitly clear she does not want to see me or have me involved in plans. But, I feel offended when I think about how my good friends have been my good friends for much longer than knowing my now-ex-friend. I feel like there is something different about this exclusive version of hanging out vs. a group of people getting together and still accepting other friends if they would like to be there. If my good friends know I’m hanging out with somebody, and we have each other’s locations, I am always okay with them showing up to my house when they ask to join the hangout. I feel like I might be the asshole for this, but I know no matter what I would be offended if my friends got together without me but made it known I would not be invited.",1
"So I (23M) have a small group of friends in the graduate program, and there is one particular inside joke we have where we say ""badussy"" for a lot of things, also putting ussy suffix on random words. It's something that is dumb but funny to us. 

I have another group outside of studying, and a handful of us said that same joke there as well. Then someone in the group, let's call her Regan, (33F) called me a different nickname relating to that, and I said I'd rather not be called that (my name with -ussy) at the end, but she still kept doing it anyway. Someone else, let's call him Jose, (25M) said ""OP, just don't say the joke around her, and she won't call you that name."" Regan did it less but still did it sometimes anyway. 

Last week Regan came up with a different name, that I'm probably not allowed to post on here, and again I flat out told her not to call me that. She said, ""I don't give a fuck 'OP-ussy,' I say whatever the fuck I want, and you're going to deal with it."" At this point I lost it and said, ""I can't control what you say, but if you continue to call me that after I told you not to, I'll know how truly inconsiderate you actually are."" 

Regan then snapped as well and said she never like the former jokes and was trying to hint at that, and only said that to frustrate me and make me stop. Jose added on, ""Yeah it's like a social thing you missed. We were trying to make you realize it and just stop making a joke so we won't say it to you."" At this point, I got super mad and told them that they should have just flat out told me what they were and were not comfortable with and I would have listened. Different people grew up with different social norms, so ""social hints"" are extremely relative and to next time just tell me straight up if she ever feels uncomfortable. Regan and Jose then laughed me off and stormed off and left the park where we were hanging out at. 

So AITA for not picking up on the hint or were they out of line for not just telling me what they wanted directly? ",1
"Throwaway, my daughter is an avid Reddit user.

I (48M) recently lost my wife to cancer a year ago. It was very devastating for me and my daughter, Emily (17F). Three months ago, I remarried to an amazing woman, Jess (41F). We’ve been working together for several years and she helped me out a lot when my wife was in the hospital during treatments.Things have always been tense between me and my daughter, as she has always been a ‘mama’s girl’. They’ve been getting more tense since Jess and her son, Eli (8M) have moved in two months ago.To give background, me and my daughter live in a 2B2B house. When it was just us, my daughter and I each had our own rooms. Now that two more people have moved in, Jess and I thought it would be best if her son slept in my daughter’s room. Emily originally did not agree with this, but eventually came around when I told her it was either share a room or take the couch. I thought this arrangement was okay, because once she turns 18 I’m expecting her to move out on her own.Other than the room situation, Emily has been hostile with Jess and Eli since they’ve moved in. I cannot understand why she could have this resentment towards Jess, who has done nothing but try to be a motherly figure for Emily.Now, we are planning a family vacation for me, Emily, Jess, and Eli. Emily and I had made the vacation plans together right after her mother passed as a way for us to mourn together. I extended the invite to Jess and Eli after they moved in so we could all feel like a brand new family. I originally booked two rooms; one for me and one for Emily so we could have our own privacy in the evenings. But Eli has insisted on his own room, so he can feel like a grown up on his first ever vacation. I told Emily about the new arrangement, and told her I could cover the cost of a new room for her, but only half. I can only do half because I am taking Eli to Legoland like he was hoping for this vacation. I am hoping that Jess and Emily will be able to bond while I bond with Eli and our family will be blended by the time we are back home.I expected Emily to be okay with this, because she is a lot older than Eli and more mature than him. Instead, she totally freaked out and went off on both me and Jess, saying she feels like not only has her mother been replaced in eight months, but she’s also being replaced by the son I have always wanted. I admit I have always wanted to be a boy dad, but that doesn’t mean I love Emily any less.I love Emily, and I really do miss her mom. But I feel like I deserve to move on and get on with my life and find happiness. Why doesn’t Emily want that for us?So Reddit, AITA?",1
"Before I met my girlfriend I used to be a huge gamer. Like after work I'd be on some video game relaxing. I used to play a lot with my friend, lets call him J. J and I met off of World of Warcraft back in 2011 and we've been best friends ever since. 

I met my girlfriend in late 2021 and she isn't into gaming like I am. When we moved in together my girlfriend expressed to me how she didn't like the amount of time I spent playing video games and felt as though I wasn't giving her enough attention. Ever since then I've done my best to be more attentive and it's meant that I haven't been playing video games as much. As of right now I will only play video games when she isn't around, busy doing something else or when she falls asleep. 

J reached out to me last week and he said he felt as though we weren't even friends anymore because I don't play with him. It's actually been months since i've been able to play with him, because it's hard to synch our times together. I apologized and told him I would try to do better. He asked me if we could hangout online this weekend and I told him I couldn't because I have things going on with my gf this weekend and I have plans next weekend with her. He said that this is why he feels as though we aren't friends because I don't make any time for him. 

I also don't know if I can talk to my girlfriend about making time for him because I know she will be mad if I said something like ""hey, I want to hangout online with J this Saturday at 8pm, are you okay with that?"" cause I know her answer will be ""no i'm not okay with that"".

"Throwaway

My college made the NCAA Tournament and its not a common thing for where I went to school.  I have a basement bar and so I invited my friends that went to the same school over for a watch party.  There were about a dozen of us core group members plus some spouses and kids.  We all went to the same school and half of us are season ticket holders of the basketball team.  We are pretty passionate fans.  If we made the Sweet 16, we'd consider going out for that. 

In the lead up I got a text from one friend saying he would be bringing his new girlfriend who I had never met before.  Which I was fine with.  When I host watch parties they are social events but we all intently watch and cheer on our school.  Everyone shows up early, we are all eating, drinking, and watching all the other games.  My buddy shows up with his girlfriend, but they are both wearing our opponents clothes.  Its a what the fuck moment for many of my friends and I.  1, our buddy went to school with us, 2, he should know better than to bring people rooting for our opponent around at an event like this.

I go confront him and say what the hell is this regarding his shirt.  He introduces me to his girlfriend and tells me she went to the school we were playing that day.  I tell him its dumb he isn't wearing clothes for the school he went to and told them I appreciate them showing but they should watch the game somewhere else.  He seems stunned, and goes I thought it'd be fine.  I said if it was a regular season game maybe, but not a Tourney game.  He starts argueing, but I just repeat it'd be better if they left.  He starts calling me an asshole and continues argueing.  I just lead them out of the house.  He sent me a few angry texts, but I didn't want people supporting our opponent at this party.  I'm aware I may have made a bad impression on his girlfriend, but was I the asshole?",1
"I (28F) gave birth to my daughter Alyssa when I was 17. My mom and I have always had a difficult relationship and not long after I gave birth, she kicked me out and I went to live with my aunt while she raised Alyssa. I went to college in another state after, and though I've seen Alyssa some since then, my relationship with my mom prevented me from being there for her. Since I graduated, I've managed to start a pretty successful business and my fiancée and I are currently in the process of purchasing our first home. I'm ready to be a mom now, and I really want to support my daughter. I had originally contacted my mother and told her that I was ready for Alyssa to come live with me, but she said no. Because of this, I've decided to file for full custody of her. I'm fairly well established financially, and my mother has had some trouble managing her money since Alyssa was born, so my lawyer is pretty confident that I'll get at least primary custody. When I told my mother about it, she was extremely upset and told me I was a complete asshole for trying to take away her kid, and that I had never wanted to be around Alyssa before. This is just not true, I've visited over the years and tried to send my mother support, but she's never wanted me there. I told her that this wouldn't be happening if she hadn't tried to keep Alyssa away from me all these years. I've talked to my aunt and my older sister about this, and they both think that I should let my mother keep Alyssa. I truly think she'll be better off with me. AITA?",1
"My sister and her husband adopted 15 year old “Jake.” He’s cool, he has his “issues” but he’s a good kid. 

The main reason my sister decided to foster/adopt is because she was told she couldn’t have kids. I was a bit worried because she tends to be a bit naive but she’s doing pretty well. Jake seems to really like her as well.
 
Anyways, my sister managed to get pregnant and revealed she was 6 months along. We’re all happy for her but Jake’s become a bit snappy. In my opinion, I think his attitude is understandable considering his background and I’m sure he’s just terrified. I figured my sister knew this and was working on it behind the scenes. 

Well she called me in tears last night saying that Jake came home high and started insulting her and the unborn baby. She then cried about how she doesn’t know why he’s acting like this and that he broke her heart. I was sympathetic but then I wondered, has she talked to him about any possible changes that may come with the baby… has she reassured him or anything like that? I asked her this very gently and she went quiet.

She then went “oh… oops? I’m an idiot, of course he’s scared. That makes so much sense.” I was a little shocked. I mean… she really didn’t talk to him … at all??? She kind of laughed it off and said “dumb blonde moment, my bad.”

Idk but that rubbed me the wrong way so I asked her if this was a joke to her. I then said “I hope you know Jake isn’t a doll you can throw away, he’s your kid now, you can’t have dumb blonde moments… and how on earth is this a silly “my bad” moment???” I won’t deny that I sounded pretty snarky but c’mon??

She got upset and said that it’s her first time being a parent and I can’t blame her for making mistakes. That she knows he’s her kid and that’ll never change and that my implications are incredibly offensive. She then told me to try adopting a troubled teen with 0 prior experience then insult her. I just hung up.

I might’ve been a bit harsh because all parents make mistakes but I feel like she should’ve known better just this one time. Still, she really does love that kid and I know she feels bad. AITA?",1
"Throwaway account, wife knows my main and I'm sure reading this would just piss her off more.

Last Saturday my wife's work had some event on. My wife asked me a few days before if I'd come and I told her no way, I hate her co-workers and I've been to one of these events before, they're dull as hell. She begged me to come, wouldn't stop asking, told me she really needed me there. Eventually I gave in as long as she promised we could leave at 10pm. (Started at 7)

Well Saturday comes and it's every bit as boring as I knew it would be. I mostly stick to the buffet and get my fill of free food as try to avoid annoying co-workers. Finally 10pm rolls around and I go find my wife, she's gossipping away to some woman, I listen for a few minutes then politely ask her for a word. We step away from the other woman and I tell her it's 10, time to go. She says just give me 20 more minutes, I'm having an important conversation with my supervisor. I call bullshit, tell get I was listening and it was just gossip. She says just 20 minutes she needs a good relationship with this woman. I tell her she has til the cab arrives then she can make her own way home. 

She comes out just under 10 minutes later, just before the cab gets there, some guy asks where she's going and she makes up an excuse about the babysitter.

We argue on the ride home and she says I ruined her evening, embarrassed her and forced her to lie to save face, I remind her I didn't want to go in the first place but I was still on my best behaviour, I just wanted to leave when she promised we would. 

When we get home she tells me she's sleeping on the couch tonight. I told her unless she wants to sleep next to me watching TV for an hour or 2 no she's not. She says fine then you stay here. Nope, it's my bed too and I'll sleep in it if I want to. So she grabs a bag and says she's heading to her mother's (where the kids are). I say cool see you tomorrow then. She tells me no I won't unless I'm ready to apologize and slams the door.

I really don't think I'm the one who needs to apologize here
1) her reactions were way outta line: dictating where I sleep, slamming doors, leaving the house
2) she nagged me into going to something I hated then broke her promise about leaving
I don't see how I'm in the wrong?
She came home the next day but has been frosty with me all week and keeps saying I need to apologize. I'm getting sick of it and think she should apologize now honestly.

So aita? Did I ruin her night? Or is she ta for her reaction?

Edit: damn autocorrect and not being able to edit the title

UPDATE: Alright y'all looks like the general consensus is ita, I'd just like to shout out to all those who noted that my wife wasn't an angel in the scenario either, even if you did get down voted to hell, there were enough of you that I decided to stand my ground on a few things.

So I talked to my wife, I told her I was sorry for escalating the argument and not just sleeping on the couch and making her feel like she needed to leave, that was uncool, I was pissed about the evening and let things get out of hand. 

However I'm standing firm that she shouldn't have pushed me on going to this, she knows how much I hate these things and that if I say I'm not comfortable doing something it's not ok for her to wear me down into going through constant pressure and guilt tripping. I never push her on things she's not comfortable with and I think I deserve the same in return.

Honestly I think I was never going to have a good time and it was doomed to end in an argument not just because I hate these things and didn't want to go but because I felt forced and that she didn't care how going made me feel.

She accepted my apology and also agreed that in future if I keep saying no she won't keep trying to force the answer she wants. 

So thanks I guess Reddit. Peace out ✌️",1
"I work as a security guard. I was scheduled to start working at this new store today, starting from 10AM - which I guess is when the store opens. I get there at exactly 10AM, and ask to place my belongings in the backroom. I was in the room for a few minutes max, and then came back out to man the door. However, in that time I guess many customers had already come in and one of the sales staff had to play security.  
On my lunch break, the manager of the store approached me and asked if next time I could come to a little bit earlier next time so that by the time I put all my belongings down I can be in front of the store at 10AM. I told her no, that if I'm rostered to start at 10AM then I will show up at 10AM, and that if they want me to come earlier then the store would have to arrange that with the security company. I'm not getting paid to come earlier so I really don't see why I'm required to.  
She got huffy with me and said that the sales staff aren't trained to be security, and with the popularity of the store every morning there will be people lining up waiting to go inside, and that I needed to be here earlier because of that. She said that it really wasn't hard to come a few minutes earlier, and that it wasn't fair to come ""just on time"". I know it's not hard to come a little earlier, but I feel it's more about the principle - if you want someone to come earlier then make that clear through the hours.  
I told her such and she just sighed and walked away. We didn't talk for the rest of the day.  


So AITA for coming into work ""just on time""?",1
"edit: I want to clarify two things. 

1. I am her dad, not sure why everyone keeps referring to me as her mother 
2. Everyone keeps telling me the grade due date is actually the post date. If I was allowed to I would post the link so that you could see that the calendar literally says ""December 19th: Grades Due From Faculty"" and ""December 20th Grades Posted"". She literally admitted to lying that they were due Sunday (today) so I'm not sure why people are so stuck on insistng I'm wrong about that  


I'm 54 and daughter is 28. She is home on break from grad school getting her phd. She's only home for two weeks because she says she doesn't have any more time even though she has a month break. That's been a big thing with her lately, she is constantly to busy to do things with us or help us out even though she does have the time.

I got my younger daughter a sweater and it turns out she already has it. I called my older daughter from work on Friday and told her she needed to run and exchange it for a different one. She said ok, she'd do it the next day. I said it needed to be done that day to get the best options and she said she was grading so she can't. I told her that it's not like she can't pause her grading, run out, and exchange it. She said she wasn't going to slow down her work and just said that I should do it when I got back from work that day. I said I was busy to and didn't feel like running out after a long day of work and she said neither did she. But she doesn't have a ""long day of work,"" she's sitting on her ass on her computer all day and doesn't even have scheduled hours to work, she can do it whenever she wants.

Today things really kicked off because I needed her to pick up an online order for a gift for my mom, her grandma. She again used the excuse of grading (she hadn't even started working yet, it was in the morning and she was drinking coffee and having breakfast.) She said that she needs to have her grades done by today but I looked it up on the website and she has until Monday evening so I called her on her BS, and she said she had ""other work"" due on Monday so she needed to get the grading done today (but wouldn't enlighten me on what this mysterious ""other work"" is). I said well tough, this needs to be picked up today so I can wrap it and I was going into the office so I couldn't do it. She said that if I don't want to do it myself, then it will be done on her own time. I told her with that attitude she can stay somewhere else and she said ""happily"" and packed her things claiming she didn't want to stay here anyway but was only doing so because I insisted. She left her gifts and said to not expect her for the holidays and she'll go to her girlfriend's family instead. I think it's ridiculous that she is throwing a fit just because she can't constantly live like she's the only person on the planet but my wife and other daughter is now furious with me. So I figured I'd ask here because my younger daughter is always reading the stories with me. AITA or am I correct that my daughter is self centered and childish?",1
"
(English is not my first language, so I apologize in advance for any grammatical errors.)

We'll refer to my husband, ""Josh"" (he isn't Penelope’s biological father), as well as my four kids as Oliver, Cath, Kate, and Penelope. Josh was unkind to Penelope in the past, which caused our separation. However, one and a half years later, we made the decision to attempt to mend our relationship because we truly loved each other, Josh was no longer unkind to Penelope in the past, and we had three children together. (To emphasize, Penelope was omitted because she is not Josh's biological daughter.) 

The issue starts right here: 
My other children wanted to watch, too, as Penelope had been watching TV for VIRTUALLY the whole day. Josh handled everything because I was working at the time. A short while later, I hear Penelope screaming violently at Josh, so I went downstairs to see what was going on.  Basically, this is what she told me:
Josh: P, stop staring at that TV, let your siblings watch.
Penelope: After I finish this final episode, they can binge watch it till they pass out on the couch.

Kate apparently began sobbing excessively because she wanted to see her show. So, Josh stopped Penelope from finishing her episode and told her that she may continue it later before taking the remote and giving it to Kate That’s when Penelope started yelling. 

Here's where I believe I am the a-hole:
Penelope said that since I, not Josh, had purchased the couch, they could watch on the floor. We genuinely believed she was joking, but she wasn't kidding. I told her, we are family, and families share things. Then she began ranting about how Josh had never treated her like family and that, therefore, they aren't. Josh became irate and said she had been watching on the television he bought while he kept silent. 

I told her that it was true, so if she really intended to play that type of game, then be it. She broke down in tears and dumped an entire glass of juice on the couch. Josh and I were both angry and yelled at her to go to her room. Now that her grandmother has said I was too harsh on her, I am starting to question if I was the jerk. Oliver advised me to put this here so that others could judge whether or not I am the a-hole. Thank you in advance for your response.",1
"My nephew said I should post here and that you folks could help ""set me straight."" 

I own a pizza joint in a Midwestern city. I don't give out personal details online so that's as much as I'll say. Before everyone went crazy about covid, my store sold a 16"" square pie, special grandma style. Now with the economy in shambles and everyone still freaking out about covid, inflation is through the roof and I have to either raise prices or cut back on sizes to keep my business going. That means I've had to modify the 16"" square recipe to a 16 x 10 rectangle. It's a 30% savings that just offsets my losses from inflation. 

Well now my business is being harassed by people angry about the inflation but they're taking it out on me, not the politicians responsible. I've had people order the 16 x 10 square and then charge me back through GrubHub, DoorDash, and all the other leech delivery services claiming I ""lied"" about the pizza because it's notliterally a square. I try to explain to these mopes that square is just a style and doesn't have to be literally a square from math class but I get charged back every damn time. 

Am I the asshole here? My nephew says I should think about it and ask you folks and you'd set me right. So have at it. Am interested asshole for doing what's necessary to protect my business?",1
"EDIT: Okay I had to log out for a bit since I didn’t see my thoughts enormous assholiness and was not ready for that response. I think I was just in too of a dark place to see how bad this post is and even if I got a lot of nonconstructive comments that hurt I got a lot of comments that really hit it on the nail with how bad it would be to follow through with this as well as giving me really sound advice. I am going to see a therapist because yea something’s wrong with my head and I need to figure it out. I will also try to join single parent groups like a couple of you suggested which I really think will help. I talked to my ex-girlfriend as well and just tried to sense how she was feeling towards meeting my son (didn’t want to put too much pressure on her) and I’m pretty sure that she hasn’t changed her mind and that’s fine. I can’t ask my mom to move out her because of my actions, don’t think it’s fair, she loves where she lives but she probably would move here for me nonetheless and I don’t want that for her. She lives in a rural area so I can’t move to her either with my job, but I am going to invest in a babysitter. Lastly I just want to say that I love my son and that i genuinely thought that him getting adopted by a stable family would be better for him when I wrote this yesterday but can now see how that can mess him up in so many different ways. I think I might have some sort of PPD that comes and goes and when I wrote this post I think I was at my lowest.

Thank you to everyone that took their time out to give me a thoughtful answer and to the people that reached out to me in private, I am really grateful.

TLDR at the bottom

So on the spring of 2016 I found out that my college girlfriend got pregnant. She wanted to have an abortion but as a christian I felt that this was against my beliefs (btw I’m not pro-life, I feel like the option to abort should be there for people that don’t believe what I do but this is what I thought was right for my child). I was graduating that year and already had a pretty well-paying job lined up so I felt that I could provide for my kid. In the end me and my girlfriend came to the agreement that the baby be born but that I would be a single parent since she did not want to have a baby this young. That fall the baby was born and after that she moved back to her home state (she went out of state for college) and I got my son. At the time me and my girlfriend were 21.

Fast forward two years and I just feel so tired and secluded from the world. My only friend is my son, between work and him I have no free time. All I do on my free time is go to the park with him, watch kids shows etc. My mom live kinda far away but she visits every few months and lets me have some alone time but it’s not enough. Also I basically have the same job I had when I graduated college with a slight salary increase, I have not been able to take any initiatives at work to qualify me for a promotion due to my parent responsibilities and a lot of people that started after me outrank me now. And I can’t date, like who wants a 23 year old guy with a kid.

I just feel unfulfilled and alone and it has started to take it’s form in a little bit of animosity against my son and I never want that to happen. I want to be a great dad that loves his kid but I don’t think I can be that, I’ve tried for two years. You always hear about this undying love you’ll have for your kid but I just never had that.

So WIBTA for putting my son up for adoption? I would have to make sure he actually get’s adopted into a stable family like I grew up in and not into a foster home  (don’t know how I would go about that though). The thing that makes me think that I am an asshole is that he has started to form an attachment to me and that it would be unfair on him to leave him and unfair on his grandmother that also has a good connection with him. But what makes me think I’m not an asshole is that I think that his childhood would just get worse the more lonely and unfulfilled I feel and that he’s better off with a more stable family. Please give me your perspective.

TLDR: I am a single dad that feels like he’s personal life is interfering with his ability to be a father, WIBTA to put up my two year old for adoption? 

EDIT: Throwaway acc for obvious reasons

EDIT: I feel like people are answering the question AITA for having a kid and then regretting my choice which I believe the entire world would agree that ITA, but I’m asking if in my current situation, as the asshole I am, WIBTA to put up my son for adoption now?",1
"Our parents were always very active people and encouraged us to be very active as well. Myself and most of our siblings thrived in this lifestyle, but one of our brothers hated it. I'll call him Tom. Tom hated being outside, exercising, heat, wildlife, etc... Our parents always encouraged him to at least try something before deciding, but they let him skip things he insisted he didn't want to do.

My brother I'm closest in age with and I wanted to do a snorkeling trip together. While planning, we decided to invite our youngest siblings as well, if our parents would pitch in a bit and were okay with us watching them. We didn't invite Tom (22) though, because we knew he'd hate this trip and we figure he'd be busy with post graduation plans and everything. In addition to snorkeling, we will also be hiking, rock climbing and free diving on this trip. All of these activities are things Tom expressly hates or even cannot safely do.

Tom heard about the trip from our parents and is hurt that we didn't invite him. We explained that the trip would involve a lot of getting up early (which he hates) a lot of physical activity (hates) and very little to no lounging and comfort (his main priories when vacationing). He said he could still come and do his own thing and ""meet us for dinner"" (we aren't planning on hitting any restaurants). I said if he wants he can book his own room on the same dates, but we know he gets really upset when he is woken up early, so we won't share with him because we don't want to deal with that.

He feels like we're bullying him and being dicks for no reason, but we aren't trying to do that. We just want to have a good time. He says it's ridiculous that our brother in middle school and sister with special needs are considered better company than him, which isn't what we said at all, but that's how he's interpreting everything. Were we assholes to not invite him?",1
"I 18m have a brother 16m, who’s currently doing his GCSEs and will be picking his A-Levels this summer. 

He already knows he wants to do something in computer science or software engineering etc and knows which universities he wants to apply for.  (None of them are overly competitive, couple Russel group but we’re not talking Cambridge or UCL here) 

For his three subjects he wants to pick Maths, Digital Technology, and Physics. I told him there’s no point doing all those hard ones. If he gets an offer the grades they want will be the same no matter what subjects he chooses. And as long as he’s doing one of the desired subjects (all 3 that he was going to do where desired) he’ll most likely get an offer as long as he gets good GCSE results. 

So he’s decided he won’t pick physics and is going to do one of those absolute meme subjects instead like moving image arts or performing arts or “Sports and leisure industry”

I feel like that’s a solid decision to make but now my mums having a go at me because she thinks that’s bad advice and he should strive to do the subjects he wants to do because he wants to do them not because he thinks they’ll be easy. And it’s my fault for telling him all this.

"My sister (Liza 24f) had a minor surgery this month and she had asked me (23m) to drive my nephew (Sam 8) to and from school for 2 weeks while she's recovering. She doesn't want me to use my motorcycle so I had to take her car whenever I take/pick up my nephew. (I am a freelance programmer so I have the time freedom). Well last Monday after dropping off Sam, I accidentally rear ended a fellow motorist. The light turned yellow and I thought they were going to beat it. I apologized to the lady driver and we exchanged information. 

After I told my sister what happened she got pissed at me for being reckless. I apologized to her and gave her the lady's details. I thought that was it. I continued to drive my nephew to and from school using mom's other car. Yesterday Liza called me and asked when I'll be paying for her $500 deductible. At first I thought she was joking so I laughed and said, ""that's funny, your kidding right?"". But she said she's serious. I said I was doing her a favor and the least she could do is thank me. We argued and then I hung up. I still picked up Sam after school and told mom I don't think I'll be taking Sam tomorrow morning. Mom being the kindhearted woman that she is told me she'll pay for the deductible and I should just continue helping my sister. AITA? It's 4:30 am right now and I am still thinking if I really am at fault and should pay the $500 deductible. I don't want Sam to miss school just because my sister and I are having a disagreement.

(We live in the same Suburb. Sam's school is 30 mins away during morning rush)",1
"A friend at work pointed me to this to get some more advice/points of view on my situation.

I (46F) am the mother to two wonderful children, Andrew (16M) and Nicole (21F). Nicole was very bright as a child and excelled in her classes, and she headed into college with a plan to get a Master’s at least. I never had to worry about her doing well or hitting milestones, but the last few years have been very surprising. She became a bit withdrawn in her teen years, more so than I realized until now, and after her first year of college she suddenly moved out from a relative’s home and got her own apartment. Then, after her second year of college (last May) she told me and her father (58M) that she was dropping out and might return in a year, but wasn’t sure, and that she was incredibly stressed and depressed and had been for years. It felt like it was coming out of nowhere. 

Last fall she got a full time job and started talking about how she was happy and finally in a good routine and that she loved working. I was glad things were at least going well for her now, but still hoping she’d return to college soon. One of the biggest recent bombshells she dropped on me though was a month ago when I drove to visit her. We went out for lunch, and we started talking about this friend (25F) of hers. Eventually, my daughter admitted to me that she was a lesbian, and that she and this girl had been dating since January and that she FLEW TO MEET HER WITHOUT TELLING ME OR HER FATHER! Mind you, she flew over 1,000 miles to see this girl that she had NEVER MET and had only called and video chatted with for a few months. I was shocked and angry, but all I did was gently scold her for not telling me, but that I’m glad she’s okay and that she had a good time with her girlfriend. I’m very new to this whole thing with my daughter, as I thought she was interested in men, but I’m willing to support her because I love her. 

The problem now is that she told me earlier this week that she intends to move within the next year and a half. She says it may be sooner rather than later because things are changing with her girlfriend’s living situation and she wanted to give me a heads up. I told her absolutely not, that she can’t move in with someone she’s only been dating for a couple of months, especially not when she’s moving several states away. All of her family is HERE, including me and her father and her brother, and her three living grandparents. I told her she’s too young and she can’t move that far away from us just for a girl. She told me that regardless of her girlfriend, she’s been wanting to move far away for years and that her girlfriend’s state was on a list of potential places. She said she loved being there when she visited and can’t wait to go back. She says I’m being unreasonable by asking her to stay and that she hates it here and feels like she “can’t be herself”.

Am I being the a-hole here? I don’t think she’s old enough or mature enough to leave.

Edit because someone asked- my daughter didn’t ask for money. She almost never asks for money, she’s like her father in that way. She’s almost completely financially independent. I have her on my health/dental insurance to help her out, my mother pays her monthly phone plan because she insisted on doing something for my daughter, and my daughters grandfather on her father’s side pays her car insurance, and my daughter goes to her father when she has car troubles because he has a lot of experience with cars. My daughter takes care of all her other needs on her own.

Edit- my child’s father is NOT my husband. We never married. We have not been together since she was born. I would have left him earlier had I not become pregnant. I regret being involved with him because he is why I was introduced and became addicted to drugs. I do not regret my daughter. Please stop calling me a homophobe. I support my daughter. I am just apparently ignorant to some things about being gay.

Edit- I am no longer talking about or answering questions about my addiction. Most of you are making baseless assumptions and disgusting accusations and I won’t entertain them. I tried my best to be a good mother and get clean. That’s that. I may not have been the best person to have custody of her as a child, but neither was her actively abusive father who stalked, abused, manipulated, and intimidated me the entire time I’ve known him.

Edit 3/24- I can’t keep up with the comments. I’ve also been banned from commenting because I apparently broke a rule. I’m going to try to talk to my daughter about all of this when I see her this weekend. I want to be a part of her life even if I think she’s moving in the wrong direction.",1
"We really emphasize academic excellence in our family. 

I have three kids (16M,14F, and 13M). My older son is taking 4 AP classes for his junior year and also is Vice President of his Science Olympiad team. 

My youngest son is a great coder and started an app development club at his middle school. 

My daughter, however, is exceptionally rebellious and difficult. This year, she ran away from home and was gone for nearly three days. She fell behind on schoolwork and got all Bs and  1 C when previously she only got all As. 

Every year before school starts if my kids get all “A”s their previous year I take them out to eat at a high end restaurant and gift them several hundred in spending money for back to school clothes. 

This year was no different except that this was the first time my daughter didn’t have all As. 

My wife was pressuring me to take my daughter too, but I was against it because this lunch was to reward my kids for getting all As. I didn’t get why I’d take the kid who didn’t get all As- it would negate the purpose of the celebratory lunch. 

I get that this year was hard for her, but she made it hard on us too. And I’ve been there for her, yet rewards are to incentivize my kids to keep achieving to the best of their ability. 

AITA? I ended up only taking my sons and giving them gifts.",1
"My daughter (13) and stepson (11) have not gotten along since my daughter moved in.

She had previously lived with her mother but I got default custody after her mother turned one of her 24 hour disappearing acts into a never coming back one.

My daughter and stepson go to the same middle school and were both running for student council VP. 

There was tension in the house and my wife told my stepson that if he won we could go out to celebrate. My daughter asked if this applied to her as well since he wasn’t her only competitor and my wife said of course.

The campaign got pretty stressful for the both of them. Then the votes come in and my daughter wins by 4 votes.

However, because somehow the one person who ran for treasurer this year dropped out because of grades, my stepson was offered that position. 

He saw it as a really pitiful consolation prize and was angry that he had to take orders from my daughter.

I felt very bad for my stepson and he and his mother (who is also very Type A), was very upset, even though of course my wife congratulated my daughter.

My stepson refused to be comforted by the fact that older kids get more easily elected because they know more people and his mother even offered to take her to her law office and give him some responsibilities, saying that was better experience than student council would ever be. 

My stepson then said “ please tell me you’re not going to rub it in my face by taking us to dinner now.”

My wife also looks really reluctant to go to dinner. 

I finally tell my daughter that we weren’t going to be going to dinner because her stepbrother was very upset by the turn of events and we need to take his feelings into consideration. And that I was impolite to gloat.

That all happened Friday. My daughter ended up crying and even now, Sunday night, she still is mad at all of us.

AITA?",1
"About three years ago my dad was injured in a really bad hit and run car accident. He broke just about every bone in his body, and left him paralysed from the waist down. Our relationship has always been really good, but I hate seeing him in pain and admittedly try to avoid seeing him because it just makes me uncomfortable. 

In November I’m getting married. I’ve been with my fiancé for 4 years and he and my dad get on really well. Naturally the discussion of who was going to give me away came up in the family group chat, and I kept silent after I realised my dad would be in a wheelchair. We always talked about him giving me away and having a dance at my wedding and I don’t want to be reminded of what could’ve been at my wedding. I messaged my mom privately and told her I want my uncle to walk me down the aisle as we’re incredibly close. 

She naturally asked why and I told her that my dad being in a wheelchair would add complications to the wedding. The walkway would have to be widened to accommodate his wheelchair and he wouldn’t be able to hold my arm or give me a proper hug. She was outraged, called me an ableist POS and removed me from the group chat. My aunt has since called me telling me my dad is absolutely devastated. AITA?

Update - I appreciate all the people who have messaged me offering me support, your kind words have meant a lot to me whilst rifling through a bunch of messages telling me to do horrible things to myself. Regardless of what you think of me, telling me these things isn’t okay. I’m going to call my dad tomorrow

Update 2 - can people please stop messaging me such horrendous stuff? think about what you’re saying. You may not agree with me or my life but you’re just as bad as I apparently am if you’re going round saying stuff like that to strangers on the internet

UPDATE - Not that I owe it to anyone but I thought I’d give you all an update. My boyfriend and I have decided to part ways and ive apologised to my dad",1
"I (44M) am a widow of a previous marriage and so is my wife (42F). She has a son (19M) from her previous marriage and I have a daughter (17F) as well. We dated for roughly 5 years before being married for 3 years now and our kids have known each other since the beginning, no major fights or weirdness besides getting to know someone else as a parent/guardian.

My son was a tremendous athlete in basketball and I used to play in college at a school I'm sure none of you heard of. Regardless, I know the ins and outs of basketball and when he asked me to coach him, I was more than happy to. Turns out that he was good, really good. Division 1 good. My wife is a controller and I'm a pharmacist, together, we make a very, very comfortable living, but are not rich. So when my son was getting scholarship offers for basketball, I realized we could pay for my daughter's college in full and neither of them would have any student loan debt when they graduate. A plan that I shared with my daughter, which I think was a mistake to begin with.

These plans changed when my son tried riding on someone else's motorcycle, with their permission, but with zero training, and got badly injured on a ensuing crash. He lost part of his hand and foot, not life threatening, but basketball ending. This happened last year and my son has been in a deep depression that we're desperately trying to bring him out of, but he feels like his entire identity got ripped away in the blink of an eye. He's been in counseling and prescribed medication but it has not helped thus far. Recently he confided in me that the pills he's on have unfortunate side effects with his libido to virtually zero interest and wants to stop them. I told him the important thing is that he's with us, but he can bring that up with his doctor next visit.

Fast forward about 2 weeks.

I'm upstairs looking for something in my room and I heard my daughter talking to her friends on her phone about college. The conversation turned towards her brother and she said she ""can't wait to be gone, I'm tired hearing (her brother) cry every day"" and saying his hand is gross I knew ""spirits"" in the house has shifted since he became injured, but I didn't think she felt this type of way. I was gonna talk to her later about this, but then I heard her say ""I heard him say that he can't even get it up"" while laughing.

At that, I was furious.

I stormed in her room, took her phone, laptop, car keys and TV out of her room. I told her she should be ashamed of how she's talking about her brother and he might do something permanent if he heard you talking about him like that.

When my wife got home, we talked about what happened and while she's proud of the way I stood up for my son, she thinks it's too far to also not pay for her college, since we could easily do so.

WIBTA if I don't pay for my daughter's college?

Edit: Fairly unanimous that this would be too far and I think I knew that, but I just can't calm down. Maybe I'm stunned that it was my own daughter saying it, but it's rare that I harbor something like this.

Also, many comments hinting that I'm alienating or neglecting my daughter are completely unfounded. The post was about my son's condition, so I talked about my son. Maybe my daughter feels less important or neglected, I can understand that, but it certainly not because of a lack of attention or love.

I accept it though, IWBTA.",1
"Exactly as the title says, my (F 29) best friend (F 35) is currently annoyed with me and not speaking to me because I told her (practically BEGGED her) to take my 3 year old godson to be looked at. Just so there’s no confusion, going forward I’ll refer to my best friend as BFF and my godson as GS. 

BFF and I are in a mutual online adult chat with 100+ people that I honestly haven’t been paying much attention to lately but on a whim decided to check this evening. The first message I see in the chat is from BFF stating “Eh my kid just yeeted himself down the stairs. So he has a fat lip and a shinner”. I immediately text her asking what happened and if my godson is ok. She tries to call me but I was using the restroom and texted her to let her know I couldn’t talk. I asked if she was going to get him checked out and when she said “idk” to which I responded “He hit his head BFF.” She then got annoyed with me and responded with a terse “Then why ask?”. There was a but more back and forth in which I pulled out of her that he fell down the entire flight of stairs and then again begged BFF to take GS to be seen. She responded with “I will talk to you later.” and hasn’t responded to me since. I’m freaking out a little bit and I’m really nervous for GS. But I also feel bad because I think BFF thinks I’m judging her. 

So AITA for telling my best friend to take her three year old to be checked out?",1
"I love cooking. I love food in general but trying new things is always exciting for me.

My girlfriend on the other hand, is a hot dog and boxed Mac n cheese type of person

When it comes to our weekly cooking I always try to get her into the process (she doesn’t cook) by asking her what she’d like and trying to cook things she’ll actually eat. This is a problem because she will almost always say my food is “too flavorful” “too spicy” “too much” when it’s really not. It’s just decent food.

Now the real problem arises in the fact that even when she comes up with something she wants - today it’s was “king ranch casserole” - I’ve never had it before so I’m happy to explore and try to cook it. That said, the recipe she shared was literally just 9 cans of crap - no real fresh ingredients.

I decided, okay - let me make my own recipe that uses real ingredients - using the SAME ingredients just fresh veggies instead of cans.

But then she decides to throw a fit because “I may as well just eat rice bowls like I always do” because “that’s not even what I wanted” and now I’m the bad guy for trying to cook us real fresh food?

Am I the asshole?",1
"It’s not a long story but I’m home in the US at my parents’ for the winter break and since I’m an exchange student I’m naturally staying at my parents’. I haven’t seen my friends and family in a while so I invited my good friend to play some video games and hang out at the house.

We had the house for ourselves until my mom came home from work at around 4pm. The weather here in Miami is good and has started getting warmer as the spring approaches. My mom likes tanning without her top on in our backyard which she did today. Now the thing is that you can directly see to the backyard that’s like 30ft away from the living room.

So when my mom started tanning my friend saw her and stared or looked (not sure which category a 5s peek goes into) at her for like 5 seconds which is a long time. I told him that he’s being disrespectful and that he can’t just be looking at my own mother’s body like that and told him to leave. 

Now he sent me a text saying that he was just surprised that she didn’t wear a top and was not being creepy or weird about it. I feel like a 5s look is more than ”just being surprised” but I’ve started feeling bad since I’m not sure if he is telling the truth and I was just being super harsh.

"My woman and I ran into car problems almost a year ago by now, and she had asked her mother to borrow her spare jeep until we were able to buy a vehicle. When we got the jeep the tires were worn a good bit and we told the mother about it. We ran the jeep back and fourth to work for about a month when the tires got really bad. My woman took pictures (through Snapchat) and sent them to her mother and said that they are getting really bad and needed replaced. We figured since it is still her vehicle and the issue was present before we started using it she would be the adult and owner of the jeep and replace the tires. Her mother said that since they got bad while we were using it that it is our responsibility to replace them. After a lot of arguing and fear of losing our jobs I caved and asked my dad if he could get tires through his work and I pay him for them. We came to an agreement on tires and the bill was just over $1200 for a full set. Every week I pay my dad $27 (that's the payment plan) for the tires. Well tax season hit and I got a decent amount for the year so I went out and bought a car, and gave the jeep back. We talked to her mother about giving me the tires since we are no longer using the jeep and again after a lot of arguing she caved and said she would next week. After almost 4 months now the excuse is still ""I'll get new tires next weekend"" every single time we ask about them. So am I the asshole for wanting to take her to small claims court and getting my tires back and possibly the money I've paid towards the tires so far?

So what I've learned is that I am the asshole for wanting tires back.

"Throwback because some of my friends are on Reddit as well. Last year, I (30 M) received news that an aunt whom I had never known existed, had passed away. She left me her house and a fairly large sum of money in her bank account. In her will she wrote that she and my late father, her only sibling, had stopped keeping in touch with each other over a ‘family dispute’ years ago before I was born. But she knew that my father had a son (me) before she moved away to another city. She never had children herself.

Anyway, my wife and I were beyond ecstatic about it. We decided to put the house up for rent. We wanted to handle this financial windfall wisely. On the other hand, when my brother (29 M) found out about it, he became really upset. He reasoned that since aunt had moved away before he was born, she had never known that I had a brother, thus deciding I was the only one to whom she would bequeath her possessions. He demanded I split the money with him.

Here’s the thing. History repeats itself. Growing up, my brother and I never got along well. He takes pride in his sense of freedom being wild and a troublemaker, partying hard, smoking weeds, going to rock concerts, spending weeks and even months traveling the world, never settling down in one place for too long. I, on the other hand, am a very organized person. I have a stable job which I love. My wife is 5 months pregnant and I can’t be happier. So excited to be a father.

Nevertheless, in a way I think my brother’s right. Aunt would have split the money between us if she had known that my father had another son. I didn’t want to repeat my father and aunt’s mistakes, so I split the money from her bank account evenly with him. But it wasn’t enough for him. He insists that I sell the house as well and split the money from its sale. Only then it would be *fair*, according to him.

I refused. I told him no. The house and money are legally mine. It was my name written on aunt’s will. My name only. I can’t change the past. It’s not my fault that aunt had never known he existed. He became furious. He asked how I would feel if I were him. He accused me of being greedy, money-hungry, avaricious, everything, you name it. He even threatened to bring the case to court. But I stood my ground.

Nowadays, I have started to feel kind of bad about the whole situation. Ignoring the fact that legally the house and the money are mine, maybe he is entitled to 50% of the house? Maybe selling it and splitting the money from its sale is the right thing to do?

Morally speaking, Am I The Asshole for refusing to sell the house and split the money from its sale with my brother?


UPDATE:
Whoaaaa didn’t expect this to blow up like this. Anyway, thanks everyone. Sorry for not responding quickly because time difference is a pain in the ass.
I think there are some things that I need to get straightened out. To those who say that I am being rather judgmental towards my brother because he *‘takes pride in his sense of freedom being wild and a troublemaker, partying hard, smoking weeds, going to rock concerts, spending weeks and even months traveling the world, never settling down in one place for too long'*, I have to admit maybe yeah I was being rather judgmental a bit. But I’ve never had any problem with that. It’s his life. He can do whatever he wants to do.

The only problem I have with it is the fact that because of his lifestyle, he always keeps running out of money. He doesn’t even have a permanent place to stay. And I am the only one he turns to whenever he has to deal with financial problems. I mean as his brother, I tried my best to help him and to always be there for him whenever he needed me. 

But then I got married. And my priority changed. But he stays the same. Still parties, travels a lot, smokes weeds, etc, which I find a bit irresponsible considering the fact that he doesn’t even have a stable job and only relies on me to help him and oftentimes support him financially. I have tried many times to knock some sense into him, to no avail. He can party hard, travel, go to as many rock concerts as possible, smoke as much weed as he can, he is free to do whatever he wants. But I have a family of my own to take care of now. I won’t always be there to get him out of trouble.

I have some reasons why I refused to sell the house and opted to put it up for rent instead. I’m saving it for later. Don’t get me wrong. I love my brother despite our differences. But he’s not the most reasonable person on Earth. He’s been spending the money I gave him partying and traveling again obviously. If I sold the house, and split the money from the sale, he would just do the same things over and over again. And by the time he has no money left, it’s predictable what he would do.",1
"For context: I (18F) live in Brazil, where we have a National Exam of Highschool to allow students to enter public college courses. It is a huge deal in here as most private universities are nowhere nearly as good as the public ones. For one to be accepted into a public uni is amazing and they are highly praised by their family.

I've always been an exemplary student. By that, I mean I was the top 1 in my class all years until the pandemic. Ever since, I've began to be heavily bullied, developed deep depression and lost contact with my friends, having to transfer to another institution in the very last year of school. I also had terrible OCD and anxiety. The past 4 years, I've been a nobody. I no longer had a personality or even basic motivation to keep going forward. I was a heavy burden to carry around. As expected, my grades also got way lower.

I have to admit I only finished school because the new institution was very comprehensive of my situation, as I couldn't even attend classes anymore without having panic attacks. I'm very thankful to them as I was able to conclude this nightmare. But the result of the National Highschool Exam wasn't out until today. As I've said, it is a *huge* deal, even though I've already decided to go to a private institution instead.

As expected, my grade was not very good. It was average. Not enough for the courses I wished to do. I was sad even though I saw it coming. I cursed a lot when I saw the result in the computer screen. My mother eventually approached me and said I should not be disrespectful. I told her I was very nervous and should be allowed to be frustrated. She then got angry at me and yelled ""well, you didn't get into college because you didn't make an effort! You didn't study, so you deserve not to go to a good university.""

I got very, very mad. She knows how much I've struggled the past years with my mental issues and how I swore to be better from now on, and yet she chose to act disappointed at me because I failed. I told her she was acting like ""a monster"" and went to my room. My mother followed me, shouting that I never respected her ever since I was young, that she only told me the truth and that she ""pitied my sad existence"". I basically told her to f off and then she left my bedroom.

Am I The Asshole?",1
"I (26M) have been with my girlfriend Kelly (25F). For almost 5 years. A year and a half ago, my friend, Maverick (25M) got engaged to his fiancée Brittany (25F).

I have been friends with Maverick for over 10 years. Maverick and I went to high school together and our families and us were very close. Maverick is in the military now and we don’t talk as much, but I still consider him a good friend.

When Kelly and I started dating, Maverick was dating a girl named Ashley (24F). Kelly and Ashley became very close. Maverick broke up with Ashley 2 years later and Kelly was sad she wouldn’t be seeing Ashley regularly, but still wanted to be friends. 

Very shortly (a few days) after Maverick broke up with Ashley, he started hooking up and then started dating Ashley’s roommate at the time. Kelly found out and called Ashley, and Ashley was crushed. 

A month after they started dating, Maverick had us meet Brittany. Kelly was upset that this was Ashley’s roommate and she FaceTimed Ashley when she was around Brittany to make her feel bad.  After this, Kelly was very upset with Maverick and sent him a series of messages saying she lost respect for him and some mean things about Brittany. I think Kelly  went too far and wasn’t happy that she got involved. Kelly did end up apologizing to Maverick.

Since these incidents 3 years ago, we have not seen Brittany again. We have heard from others that Brittany is controlling about who Maverick sees, and she has refused to see us every time they have been in town. Maverick doesn’t live in town anymore so I don’t see him all the time, but we have hung out 1-3 times a year when he visits our city. Kelly has seen him once since this incident and was civil and friendly to Maverick.

Maverick and Brittany announced that they are getting married about 6 months ago. I found out that their wedding is the same day as Kelly’s birthday. Kelly has been nervous for months that she wouldn’t be invited, but I assured her that Maverick wouldn’t do that. 

I got a save the date about 6 weeks ago. It was only addressed to me, but I didn’t think that was weird. I texted Maverick and asked if I had a date, but he didn’t reply. I used their wedding website to RSVP about a week ago, and I was able to enter Kelly’s name as well. Yesterday, Maverick texted me and said that he does not want Kelly at their wedding. He said that based on what happened with the girls that he and Brittany are not comfortable with Kelly being there.

Kelly is crushed. She wants to be with me on her birthday and has a tough relationship with her birthday. Additionally, we got into a very big fight 2 years ago because I went to a family wedding without her. AITA for not going to my friend’s wedding because my girlfriend isn’t invited?",1
"I (19F) am currently a freshman in college. I just got into a huge argument with my parents and I know that I could have definitely handled it better but AITA? 

For context I just finished my first semester in college. I have always struggled in school, not really grade wise but i struggle paying attention in class. I try to pay attention but my mind always ends up drifting to something else and before i know it it’s been 30 minutes and I haven’t listened to anything my professor has said. I struggle with many other symptoms of (what my ex therapist said was most likely) adhd or autism or both. I have been wanting to get tested because this has made turning in and remembering assignments really difficult for me, but my parents don’t believe me and everytime i bring it up they say it is because i don’t get enough sleep or i’m not eating right. 

So onto the argument. I was taking classes so that I could apply to switch from a biochem major to a marketing major. My request was denied because my grades didn’t qualify to switch. I admit i am in the wrong here. my parents pay for my college and I know that I have messed up. Because i have to retake two classes to get the grades required to switch my major. 

Since finding out that I was not able to switch my major i have switched up my lifestyle in order to make sure i can get the grades necessary. i have started going to bed and waking up early and i have created a complete plan of how i will make it up this semester and going forward. 

Today i was showing my parents my new schedule and explaining it to them and my parents kept commenting on my online class that i wouldn’t be able to do it and that i wouldn’t try hard on it and complete my assignments. this really triggered me because of how hard i’ve been working to show them that i am serious about school despite them ignoring my struggles with it. this created an argument. i said that i didn’t want to discuss with this anymore and i started to go upstairs and my dad said that i would need to figure out my own phone bill. i said that if my grades start slipping again j know it’s because i’m working to pay off my stuff and he said we will see if i even go back. at that point i left and i want to know AITA?",1
"Throwawy because my gf has reddit.

My GF Lauren has a great relationship with her boss Chelsea, actuallyreally friendly outside of work. They go to dinner or lunch together and discuss both work stuff and real talk.

Even though Lauren always looks very clean and put together, she also isn't a very professional dresser in my opinion, not the way an office lady usually looks. She rarely wears make up, keeps her hair in a short cut and does nothing to style it, and wears only pants to work, never a dress or skirt, and only button downs and blazers. I love her and I love that the work environment she's in let's her feel comfortable enough to dress like this. She likes make up, she just likes either to be barefaced or go for dramatic looks that aren't appropriate for the office. Rarely she'll put on some lipstick and basic contouring.

Those two facts together made me think that when she invited me to join her at a work dinner on Tues that it wasn't a formal occasion. I asked Lauren was she was wearing, she said nice slacks, a button down and a blazer, telling me that I would be fine to do the same, plus on FaceTime she had metallic eyeshadow and white eyeliner on, so I dressed in dark blue jeans and a plaid flannel button down.

When I showed up, I quickly realized not only was there more than just Lauren and Chelsea but I was the only person wearing jeans, not that it was easy to see that especially once we all sat down. One of Lauren's coworkers was wearing a polo and khakis though, which I felt was equal to my outfit. No one looked twice at my clothes and we all had a good time. It was a nonissue.

Lauren and I had planned on her following me home so she could stay the night with me, but when we got to our cars she said she didn't want to anymore because she was mad I didn't dress appropriately to dinner. I said I dressed just as appropriately as she did because there was nothing business appropriate about wearing white eyeliner. She just laughed in my face at that and told me to fuck off. I tried texting and calling her, but she just told me to leave her alone and refused to discuss the fight instead of just shutting me down.

Edit: No not all women need to wear skirts to be professional, but you match the formality of your boss in the work and Lauren is the only woman in the office that never wears a dress or skirt, contrast where Chelsea always does. No she doesn't need long hair to be professional but there needs to be some styling to it, something to give body or make it look less like she just ran a brush through it and called it a day. It wasn't a lumberjack style flannel, it was black and white and pressed nicely. I could have dressed it up with a jacket and in hind sight I would have. I don't get how it's bad to call a flamboyant face of makeup not professional, but I didn't mean it as an insult and I don't get why ""basic contouring"" was such a bad thing to say?

Edit: resounding yes. I didn't understand a lot of what I was expecting or how it appeared or what the implications were. I made connections between things that really aren't equal at all.

&#x200B;

Last edit: Thank you to those that helped explain my double standards and context about what I expected and how it wasn't appropriate or fair. A lot of people pointed out some mental processes and justifications I had used without thinking of it and the way my actions and words come across no matter if I meant it that way or wanted to think of it that way.

"So, I used to be married to Judy (36f) and we have a daughter Scarlet (13) together - fake names. Judy never wanted kids but I did and I assumed she did too. We had her and Judy completely changed, she wasn't caring toward Scarlet, they didn't bond and she blamed Scarlet for us losing our independence. About a year after, we had a divorce and she gave me everything. It did hurt me that she didn't even want to see Scarlet once a year even. She moved to Seattle months after, started running a business, got really fit, her cousin told me she even got laser surgery to remove her stretch marks.

Since then, Judy has moved to LA and divides her time between there, London, Mumbai and NYC. She has become a fairly famous influencer and socialite. I check her instagram every now and then and she's been at parties with celebrities all over the world and truly seems happy. To her credit, every time her financial situation changed, she would come back and get our child support agreement changed to give more to Scarlet. Every time she'd come, she would spend time with Scarlet. She even kept it the same even though my new wife makes a lot more money than both of us and we don't need it now.

About three years ago, she started calling more to talk to Scarlet. She would also come over more and every spring break, she comes for those two weeks. She phones every night unless she's in London, Mumbai or NYC - in which case she just sends a text. On New Years, she was at some celebrity's party but still took the time to phone. Now, I'm not saying that this makes up for anything but she has been a presence in Scarlet's life.

Well, we just found out that Judy's grandfather is very ill and he's going to pass away within a month, maybe early March at best. So, she's going to India for spring break for his funeral and has requested to take Scarlet with her. I'm fine with that, my wife is fine with that. However, Scarlet got really upset at the idea of spending two weeks in India. I pointed out her mom will take her to all the nice places, she'll get to see great things, meet that part of her family. But she said that it's not fair. So, I pointed out that at the very least, she can get whatever she wants out of her mom in those two weeks.

My wife overheard and said I was an asshole for telling Scarlet that it's all right for her to use her  mom for cash since she has barely been in her life. I pointed out I didn't say that but we argued and since then, I realize what I said kind of did amount to that. Was I the asshole?

Edit: Judy never told me she did not want kids. She allowed me to believe she did. If I knew she didn't, we would never have gotten married.",1
"I, 15F, have a friend who’s also 15F, let’s just call her Beth. We’ve been close since middle school and I used to even call her my best friend. However, more recently she’s been getting super annoying. This isn’t very out of character for her, as she’s always been the sensitive type but she’s gotten more out of control recently.  
  
Beth had been talking a lot about how her 4 year old pet, a bearded dragon, had died and how upset she was. At first I was more sympathetic but I’m genuinely getting sick of hearing Beth talking about it. It’s been a bit more than a week since it passed away (she hasn’t even told me how) and she’s still talking about it. She has been going back to school, but hasn’t even been getting much work done because of how gloomy she’s been acting.  
  
Now, this might be where I’m the AH. On Thursday I told Beth to shut up about the lizard and how she should be getting over it by now. (Keep in mind that this was in the middle of class) She began crying again and told me how much of a bad friend I’ve been during this time and how she just misses her pet.  
  
I wasn’t even being a bad friend, I was listening to her talking about it this whole time. I told Beth that, followed by telling her she was being Immature for crying over a pet that may as well be classified as an inanimate object. Beth got mad and called me selfish. That was really the tipping point and I told her that it was her fault it died. It was 4 years old ffs and bearded dragons are meant to live for much longer so it must’ve had something to do with how she cared for it.  
  
She went home early and when I got home, I checked and she blocked me on basically everything she had me on. I want to hear some other opinions on this so the next time I see her I can tell her and hopefully get things worked out.  
  
So, Am I the asshole?

"Yesterday I(33M) proposed to my lovely now fiancée(32F). I have been waiting for a while and wanted to make sure it was extra special so I decided to take her and a couple of close friends and propose at the lookout where we had shared our first kiss. However when the day came there was one problem. See my fiancée suffers from gout. She's had it her whole life and has learned to not let it slow her down ,which is one of the reasons I admire her.

 That day she was suffering from a mild flare up of dactylitis, which causes her fingers to swell up. She wasn’t having other joint pain so she still agreed she wanted to go with us. We took the incline rail up and while she was taking pictures over the lookout I got down on one knee waiting for her to turn around. Once she did I gave her my sappy speech and asked her to be my wife. She accepted but when I tried to put the ring on her finger it wouldn’t go all the way on since her finger was swollen. At the time she laughed it off and just said we’ll figure the ring out later. 

But later when we got back to our car she started ranting about how I had embarrassed her in front of our friends because the ring didn't fit and that I was selfish for proposing on a day where her fingers were swollen and hadn’t thought to accommodate her. I know she struggles with self confidence especially with her weight so I definitely feel bad. However I had been planning the proposal for a while and had my heart set on proposing that day I didn’t know she would have a flare up. AITA?

"Hi everyone, I’d like some input. 

My wife and I struggle to make ends meet. We strictly budget everything down to the dollar, without a lot of wiggle room. This includes our groceries, which we have a set $ amount we spend, no more. 

Recently our DD dropped the milk and spilled it. It was 5 days to payday and we’d already done our grocery shopping. My wife said she’d figure it out. I know she has a little money stashed for herself that she’s gotten from selling some of her clothes recently, so when she came home with milk and a bag of chips for the kids as a treat, I figured she must have decided to dip into that. Boy was I wrong. 

The next week I noticed our food was a little...higher quality. A couple of brand name things, even a roast on Sunday with asparagus. I figured she must have gotten some killer deals, but when I asked she said “oh no, I found a bunch of money off coupons.” Then she showed a few to me. 

They were those “Earn 0.07$ a gallon” receipts you get at the gas station. She had gone there and dug through the garbage! She said she got about 5$ worth of these receipts the first time when we needed milk, and went back the next week for more, netting about 30$ total. 

I was speechless. I asked her how she could lower herself like that. She replied that she did it for our kids. When I asked why she didn’t use her money she had saved, she said it was hers and she was saving it for something special. 

I’m so disgusted guys. I can’t believe she did this. I don’t even want to look at her. She on the other hand is mad at me, and says I’m an asshole for being mad, and for expecting her to use her saved money instead. AITA for expecting my wife NOT to dumpster dive?

Edit: OK! I am definitely the asshole. After reading all of your comments, I really thought about it. I talked to my wife, and told her I was sorry for the way I acted. She is annoyed but willing to forgive me. I was actually mad at myself. The reason we are struggling is because I was in an accident a few months ago. I slid through a stop light on an icy road. It has permanently affected my ability to work in the trade I’ve worked in for 15 years. I’m on disability through my employer but it isn’t even half of what I used to make. We are getting by, but it is tight. And I don’t know what we are going to do when it runs out. My wife is stretching every dollar (she takes care of the finances). I guess I was just mad at myself because I can’t take care of my family anymore, and lashed out. I’m going to give her a foot rub tonight. Thanks for the honesty guys. ",1
"When my son was in middle school, he was best friends with a girl named S,  who he started dating right around when he started high school. S had a poor relationship with her family, and was such a sweet girl so I was more than happy to include her in all our family activities: vacations, dinner, etc.

Around Christmas of their senior year my son told me that S's parents were kicking her out shortly after she graduates, and wanted to know if she could stay with us the next semester starts when she could find a place to stay near campus, and I of course agreed. However when the day came when she was supposed to move out, but my son told me he they are no longer dating, and he is dating another girl in their friend group (who was S's best friend). I asked him if S had a place to stay, and he said it was ""no longer his responsibility"". He described S as ""needy"" and thought being with her was ""just a lot of work"".

I told him we need to make sure she has a place to stay, but he refused, so I told him I would with or with out him. So long story short, he decided to stay with his father all summer, because she had no where to stay and he didn't want to be around her.

Well all that was four to five years ago, but all that time i've kept in contact with S and tried to be there when she needed me. Well she was graduating (and had no one to show up for it), so I of course accepted when she asked me to attend her graduation. However when my son later brought up his graduation I found out it was on the same day.

I explained that I wouldn't be attending, because S had no one else showing up to her graduation. He didn't know I was in contact with S and I think that just added to how upset he was. I tried to explain, he would have his dad, step-mom, aunt, step-siblings, and 2 sets of grandparents show up, and should try and picture things from her perspective. I couldn't get him to understand, even though I had also already promised to take him to dinner where ever he wanted (with as many other relatives as he wanted to attend) the day after.

Even though that was a while ago, he still hasn't forgiven me. I've tried talking to him, but our relationship has never been the same. AITA?",1
"Throwaway account for privacy.

I (33F) have two children, 4m and 1f.  My husband (Tom, 32m) and I decided early on that I'd be a SAHM, since I never had the drive to work full-time and I enjoy being a full-time mother.  Most of my friends and family have supported this decision.  One of my best friends, Zoe (32f) has been mostly supportive, although she doesn't really agree with it; she's a professor at a university but only goes to campus 1-2/week.  She's spent a long time building up her career and is very good at her job; I think she's a fantastic teacher.  Zoe and Quentin are very good friends of ours; if anything happens to my husband and I, we want Zoe and Quentin to take in our children.

Zoe and Quentin have been trying for several years to get pregnant, but haven't succeeded yet.  They've turned to medical assistance for help and are in the preliminary process, but Zoe has been sad about how long it's taking.  She doesn't intend on giving up her career after having kids, but will work from home until her kid(s) are old enough for preschool, although they have family nearby who will also help.  I try to be supportive of her during this process.  We were spending time together last week and she was telling me about how hard it's been to stay positive during this process, and I gently observed that maybe this was the universe's way of telling her that she might never be a biological mother but  is a fantastic mother-figure to her students.  She grew incredibly upset at this comment and said that medicine has advanced enough for her to still have a chance, to which I responded that nothing was guaranteed.  She accused me of being smug and condescending about having children while she doesn't yet, which floored me.  I was simply trying to prepare her for the worst in case it turns out that way.  Zoe called me TA left angrily, and since then Quentin sent me one very angry text to say that I should apologize, but that's it; we haven't heard from them since then.  Tom says I was just being honest and am NTA, and to give them time, but I'm not so sure.  I've never seen Zoe so angry, although I don't regret what I said.  So, AITA for what I said, or should I apologize?",1
"My husband thinks I'm in the right, but my niece helped me make this post on here to see what other people think.

I (52f) have three sons ages ranging from 13 to 20. My oldest son (20m) has a girlfriend (19f) that hands around our house a lot... It's a really small house and doesn't have a lot of space. She's a nice girl but gets on my nerves sometimes because she's always over. I really don't think she's right for my son, either. Our tapwater has a weird aftertaste so I order gallon water bottles and use them to refill a big glass bowl with a tap.

It is not cheap to get water and other groceries delivered, so I tell my sons, husband, and the girlfriend to be courteous of the other people who live here and not use up the water, as it runs out fast in our big household.

Yesterday, I caught her filling up her big metal water bottle with the jug water, and I calmly told her that other people live here, too, and she shouldn't hog the water all to herself. She was rather short with me and said something along the lines of: ""Actually, this water bottle is big enough to hold all the water someone should be drinking in a day. I'm not hogging water, I'm just trying to stay hydrated.""

I found her tone to be disrespectful and ordered her to leave. She scoffed and went back to my son's room. That's when I really got frustrated. I opened their door and told her she has to leave. My son got really angry with me and told me that my girlfriend didn't do anything wrong and why is it a crime for her to drink water? I explained that I order this water for our family to use, not leeches who hang around all day rent-free. My son's girlfriend got a little teary eyed and left the room and out the front door without saying anything.

My son told me that I was a major asshole and should have just minded my business. I think she's just wasteful and a brat. AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for all the comments. I have spoken to my son about the issue, and you all made me realize that it was deeper than just the water. I showed him this post and explained that it's not her, it's me. I think she reacted that way when I initially told her off for filling up the bottle because--and my son helped me realize this, too--I was never really nice to her to begin with, in the course of their three year relationship (in my defense, she only started hanging around our house a lot about six months ago because she got a license). 

We called her on the phone this morning and I apologized for my reaction to the bottle. I explained I didn't mean to make her feel bad about the water--it really wasn't that big of a deal, and I feel silly for making it a big deal. She apologized for having an attitude and explained how she can feel a little defensive around me sometimes. I told her and my son that I will work on my attitude. My husband still thinks she was being disrespectful but I explained that I'm the reason she felt the need to act that way in the first place. It's not my choice who my son decided to date and I need to respect his choice. I think she is a sweet girl, and I feel horrible for the way I have been treating her. Again, thank you to everyone for making me realize my mistake.

PS: I have looked into purchasing a Brita pitcher to see if that is more cost effective. My son's girlfriend now brings water from home--although I didn't tell her to do that.",1
"
English isnt my first language and im on mobile so im sorry for the grammar! (I have slightly edited the post because i realized i wrote it in a way which doesnt represent the situation in the right way)

So a few weeks ago I had a very stressfull time at school. I was working on several big projects in and out of school at once and a lot of responsibility, which i was too scared to turn down, as I am an overachiever. In my freetime optional hobby, i was tasked with completing a short cretive writing exercise. I am not very experienced within the area, but I have a few friends who do this kind of thing on their freetime. Lets call them Alexa and Ryan.

I first asked Alexa for help on the project several weeks ago, back when I still had a long time to get the writing done. Alexa agreed happily and so I waited. Eventually it was a week until the event which I had to have the writing ready for and Alexa stopped answering my messages about the issue. I became very anxious about this as I had told everyone at the event i would have alexa complete the writing for us, and I didnt want them to be let down. I also didnt want to put Alexa in a bad light in front of my project group and so i turned to Ryan. 

Ryan has similar experience in creative writing and is friends with people in my project group. At this point I only had around 2 days to get the writing done. Ryan said he would see if hw had time to complete the project for me and I thanked him for his effort. 

For context, this writing project was a poem which only had to be a few sentences long, but i have no talent when it comes to writing poetry, jut I was put on writing duty for the project and so was therefor responsible for getting this poem done. I then messages ryan later that night asking about the poem, and he said he was unable to help me, as he had to babysit his younger sister. I understood he was busy, but was confused about how he couldnt help me due to his sister.

I was dissapointed but understood, but decided to confide in Ryan about my stress. We have been friends for a decade and have used each other for support countless of times, so I didnt think much about this. I explained how much stress i was under, basically begging him to try and help me. Ryan responded ”ok” and i realized i had maybe gone too far. I made a joke about his response and he suddenly responded with: ”was i supposed to comfort you?”

This made me shocked, as I had never heard him talk like this. He proceeded to explain I was guilt tripping him into writing a poem and how I shouldnt traumadump on him without warning. I understand I mightve comw across as entitled or guilt trippy but I hadnt realized it, and so his response really hurt me.

Since this event, Ryan and Alexa have both unfriended me and have claimed that i have been a guilt tripping person and have said many hurtful things. I have been worried about my behavior ever since. So reddit, do you think I am an asshole for my behavior?


EDIT: I wanted to make an edit quickly, since a few comments made me realize my mistake. I tried to write this vaguely as I can’t remember if Ryan uses reddit and wabted to keep details private.

The project I mean is a theater production. My job is to be a writer/codirector for the play. When I signed up for this job, a poem was not included. Ryan showed interest in helping me with the poem BEFORE i asked him for help originally. He offered to help me after alexa started ignoring my messages. Ryan used to be a part of the thester group i am doing the production in and was going to be a part of the project before backing out last minute.  

Also a bit of background on me and ryan, as i feel the need to express how this situation had a lot of events leasing up to it that accumilated into such a big responsw for the both of us. We met in school and have been best friends for years. In our relationship we have been able to confide in each other freely, or at least that has been my viewpoint and ryan never said anything to the contrary. This is why I originally confided in him, which i understand now was a mistake. This conflict was the final straw for our relationship which had been on the rocks for months. He had started being mean to our common friends and talked crap about me behind my back. He also did this to our other friends, i didnt know until recently. Ryan and alexa have made up lies about me and my other friends, and some of them have been serious such as claiming our friend lied about being hospitalized (something which he has proof of) because he was ”too open about it”. 

Also my job was not to write the poem but to find someone who could and if i didnt find anyone, THEN write it myself. Actors saved me and covered it in the demo show, since we didnt have a poem at all in the end.

This is a very complicated situation, but I only wanted advice on this specific situation as I have felt a lot of guilt about it. Thank you for reading and giving feedback:)

EDIT2: Thank you for all the comments. I made this post to see if my behavior was wrong in this situation, as it is sometimes diffiult to check your own behavior due to biases. I have now gottwn the perspective tht yes, i was wrong in this particular situation. While I still stand by my opinion tht Ryan and Alexa are bad friends for me in the grand scheme of things, I could have still handled this much better and i should have left the situation with ryan when he said he was unable to help. Thank you everyone.",1
"For quick context purposes, I'm a recovering alcoholic. I've been sober for 4 years. I used to love day drinking -- basically waking up in the morning and drinking right away. 

&nbsp;

One thing that helped me kick the juice is drinking O'Doul's in the morning. It's a habit I haven't really broken, and with being said, I bring a 6 pack of O'Doul's into work every morning and drink them at my cubicle. For those unaware, O'Doul's is a non-alcoholic brand of beer.

&nbsp;

I have a handful of coworkers that find this offensive. I won't call out anyone individually, but I've heard comments like ""I wish I could crush a 6 pack of beers at work"" or ""I guess it's 5 o'clock in InternationalArt's world"" or ""The rest of us are working hard while InternationalArt's over there treating this like some sort of frat house party"". I've also been told I ""reek like beer"", and I've even heard people undermine my sobriety by saying I still have a problem and that ""drinking non-alcoholic beer doesn't make it any better"". 

&nbsp;

I was recently brought into a meeting with HR and notified that some employees had issued complaints against my ""behavior."" I was frustrated because no one yells at Diane for drinking 8 Diet Cokes a day, yet here I am in HR's office. I was politely asked by my employer to leave the O'Doul's at home. I'm having an issue understanding why this is a problem. AITA for drinking O'Doul's at work?",1
"I (27) am the middle daughter in our family. I have 2 sisters (Kelly 30) and (Rachel 25). We lost Kelly to cancer in 2019. It was the biggest tragedy she left behind her twin boys (7) and husband (BIL Joseph 30). He used to spend a lot of time at my parents to get help with the kids. Rachel then moved out and kept her distance for few months.


2 months ago we were at my parente house when Rachel and Joseph got up  and announced that they were engaged. to say that we were shocked is an understatement but my parents said nothing after Joseph explained that Rachel helped him in his darkest times and comforted him a lot since they were both connected by Kelly's passing. I just left with my husband as Rachel started crying after I called her disgusting to her face to do this to our sister.

When things calmed down I actually recieved an invitation to Rachel and Joseph's wedding while asking for my ""approval and blessing"" My husband laughed saying these 2 were legitimately mentally unstable to carry on with this; and I couldn't believe it either! I returned it immediately and refused to give my approval which caused Rachel to go on social media crying about how I mistreated her after she sacrificed her job and life to shelter her nephews and help them live stable life and make sure they don't get stuck with an evil stepmother who might abuse them. Basically saying she's doing this for her nephews to be able to grow up and stay close to family.


My parents visited to talk and started praising Rachel for all of her ""sacrifices"" and good deeds by looking after the kids and asked that I finally approve of their marriage and attend the wedding but I lost it on them asking if they ever thought what Rachel did was okay. What about Kelly? Would she have wanted her sister to take her place? My God....the kids, what about the kids? How do they even feel about this? Who's Rachel to them now? Auntie? Mom? Stepmom? All 3? And they think they won't be confused and angry their own aunt took their mother's place? If you're saying you're just trying to keep the family together the family is already divided and I won't be surprised if my nephews cut contact when they're old enough to do so. Mom said my behavior was disgraceful and argued I was wrong in most of the points I made and called me judgemental and bitter to decide to guilt Rachel for ""stepping up"" to take on a role of the mother and said I was selfish to judge my grieving sister and brother inlaw after I questioned the length of their relatioship cause if this was happening while Kelly was alive and sick then I'm speechless but if it was happening in the past few months then neither Joseph nor Rachel are thinking rationally. We went on for hours arguing then they left. I told my husband to block Joseph but Rachel reached out via SM saying I'm making her feel guilty with my stance and disapproval of her relationship and said I was making it hard for her and the kids when she's trying to bring the family together.",1
"My daughter, who just turned 16 years old, has always been a bit lazy and/or careless. She’s loads the dishwasher sloppily sometimes, takes a good five minutes to get ready to walk the dog instead of just putting on a coat and going, and she leaves a mess wherever she goes. When she gets super into something, it seems to disappear - for a year, (the year prior to when covid started to get bad and shut down school clubs and eventually schools) she would wake up at 5:30am four times a week to get to practice before school, and she’s just very active in general because shes engaged in two different sports several times a week. She can also stay up for hours when she’s writing a creative writing assignment or essay (she enjoys writing). 

However, the worst thing for her is waking up in the morning. Its always been so, so bad - to the point where I have to enter her room and drag her ankles out of bed, unless she has volleyball (not that she’s has volleyball recently, so it’s almost an every day occurrence). It’s horrible. She doesn’t get out even when she desperately needs to pee. Since covid started, she’s gotten so much lazier as well, to the point where she skips out on showering for days on end unless she’s going to the park with her friends, simply because no one will see her. She’s also behind in all subjects except one, geography, because she really likes doing it - she can spend 3 hours on one geography essay, but doesn’t touch any of her other work. That’s not normal. In every other subject, even the ones she loves, like history and English, she starts doing the work, and after five minutes she stops, leading to an increasing amount of phone calls home. Her grades have dropped down from all A’s and one B from when she was in school physically to several B’s, two C’s and only one A (yes, in geography). She has also started eating a lot more, to the point where I noticed her eating habits. She’s still skinny as a stick and only four and a half kilograms off from being medically underweight because she’s tall and naturally lean but I have definitely noticed an uptake, especially in junk food and soda, and she is acting noticeably less energetic. (I’m not starving her - she eats plenty, she just seems to have a fast metabolism and does a lot of sport). It’s like she did a complete flip from being energetic and easy going and hanging out with her friends every day after school (even then she tried to get away with as little work as possible when doing chores) to someone who is much more inclined to do even less around the house and much less schoolwork. She cannot organise anything as well, and procrastinates like it’s her job.

This is where I think I may be TA. This morning, it was the usual morning battle; I was telling her to get up, to which she at first ignored me and then told me she was about to get up. I snapped and told her she was lazy as fuck and that she needs to pull herself together, and that she was just like her father and her laziness not only terrifies me, but it’s going to be the reason that she fails in life. She didn’t respond. I thought about it later and I feel really, really guilty.

So, AITA for saying that? I feel bad, but I also feel like it may have been necessary for her to get herself together. She’s been acting even more careless than usual, though, which makes me think that I’m a huge ass for saying that, especially the comparison to her father. She has a step dad now, who she adores (more than me, I’m convinced). Her step dad also said that what I did was horrible and I should apologise immediately, but I just snapped. Thanks in advance for the replies, I’ll accept any judgement.

Edit: A lot of people said she has depression. I think she may be struggling, but I wouldn’t say it’s depression. She still seems somewhat happy; not as energetic and free spirited as she used to, but that’s to be expected when she sees her friends much, much less. She gets exercise because she walks the dog twice a day and runs around with him in the park, so she gets sunlight as well.

Edit 2: Some people are also suggesting ADHD. I really really doubt it. I mean, I’ll get her to take an online test, but ADHD is different. She just doesn’t want to do things, she wants to get away with as little work as possible. That’s just a fact. If she had ADHD, why would she have good grades across the board when in school (not online)? She consistently gets A’s and A*’s in almost every subject, and gets among the top 3 scores in her class in almost every test she takes. When she wants to be bothered, she is bothered, but only for things she’s very excited about, like volleyball or a rock climbing trip. Then, she has no problem waking up.",1
"My boyfriend who is Latino is visiting his family in his home country. His cousin who owns a spa mentioned being able to give a massage. He in conversation mentioned to me he will be getting a full body massage from her and I found this a bit strange because to me I wouldn't feel comfortable getting a massage from my male cousin as the idea of being felt up in that situation is uncomfortable for me. I'm beginning to wonder if it's a matter of my culture being a bit more conservative than his. In this conversation I out of frustration told him ""I'll just get a massage from a guy then"" to which he thought would be uncomfortable for him and said it's not weird for him because it's his cousin. He also said it would be weird if his guy cousin gives him a massage but not his female cousin that he ended up backtracking on after I pointed out the contradiction. WIBTA to draw a boundary with this? I think I explained my discomfort but he thinks I'm being dramatic about feeling weird.",1
"Our son is 22 and our daughter is 26. She bought a house in July. We know that moving into a new home always comes with unexpected costs, right after you've probably depleted most of your funds. So, for Christmas we gave her $4000. Our son we gave a few different gifts totaling somewhere around $800.

Our daughter had to work Christmas, but we did Christmas on the 26th and she stayed with us for the holidays from then until yesterday. Our son still lives with us, and today he told us both that he didn't want to say anything while his sister was here, but his feelings were hurt by the disparity in the value of the gifts. We explained that the gifts we got him were tailored to his interests, but his sister has just passed a big life milestone where money is more important to her right now than sentiment. He said it's still hurtful because it feels like we are more proud of her than him.

My wife got really frustrated when he said that and asked why he would choose the least charitable interpretation of our actions. He said that's just how he felt and he couldn't control it. I said that we didn't give her money because we were more proud, but because we had experience being new homeowners and knowing that something always breaks in that first six months and it's always expensive. He said that was all fine and good, but it still hurt to get a worse present and feel like an afterthought.

My wife asked if he expected us to get him four thousand dollars worth of gifts. He said no, but he expected the gifts between him and his sister to be equal. My wife said that's the same thing, and my son said it isn't. He said we could have given her the monetary equivalent of what we gave him. I told him that it isn't really fair for him to decide how much we spend on someone else's gift. Furthermore, cash is less personal than gifts, so giving her a cash equivalent to what he got would be her getting the ""worse"" gift.

He said we weren't listening to him, just justifying. My wife said we didn't need to justify anything, and he was being entitled. At that point he said he didn't want to talk unless everyone was civil and he went to his room. He skipped lunch (breakfast for him) today, and when he left for work he didn't say goodbye even though I was right by the door.

My wife is irritated, and my son is clearly resenting us. I can't really decide if we're in the wrong here. On the one hand, we should be able to give our money to whoever we want. On the other, I never want to hurt my son's feelings. Were we wrong?",1
"My wife (41F) of four years and I (45M) have a blended family. She and I both have a daughter from a previous marriage. Her daughter is 8 and my daughter is 7. 

I was raised by a dad who made a good salary but blew every dollar he earned. As a result I have always lived frugally and hate conspicuous consumption with a passion.

Now my wife and I are economically stable- she is a travel nurse and I own a contracting business. We have agreed that we would not raise our kids to be indulgent spenders. 

However, a caveat is that my wife and my stepdaughter are attached at the hip- she calls her the love of her life and her muse, as well as her fashion twin. My wife has recently started her own nursing agency and between that and her summer contract, she is making more than me for the first time. Despite her often arranging for my stepdaughter to travel with her during the summer or visit her office, she also feels a lot of mom guilt.

Therefore she is very susceptible to the dreaded puppy dog eyes. The puppy dog eyes convinced her to fork out money for membership to a mini golf place that my stepdaughter got bored of after two visits. And it worked today at the mall. We first went to get the kids new backpacks and then went across the mall to Bloomingdale's because my wife was getting interviewed by a local paper and needed something to wear.

When we were there we kind of split up because my stepdaughter squealed "" twins!"" and went to help her mom pick out clothes. I found a place to sit down with my daughter because I needed to answer a few emails. I come back to earth because my wife and stepdaughter had disappeared and my daughter said she saw them go down the escalator. We go down and find them at a jewelry counter. My daughter makes a noise of dismay as she watches them get handed two matching bags. 

My daughter asks if she bought something for her stepsister and my wife says "" no sweetie, it's just for me."" However, a look at her stepsister's face tells my daughter that she's lying and she starts saying ""What did you get? Can I have one please?"" My stepdaughter says "" it's called a tennis bracelet and I got it because mom and I twin."" My wife shushes her and says we should go home now. But my daughter kept repeating "" can I have one? I want one."" She then bursts out into tears. I tell my daughter to come with us, and when she doesn't I am exasperated and say "" Stop- you are acting very spoiled. A lot have less than you."" My daughter then stomps after us.

When I get home I find out the bracelets cost over $2,000 together and expressed dismay to my wife, reminding her of our no luxury policy for our kids. She says she knows but that it was the happiest she has seen her daughter and she has to go away for business soon and felt guilty. I feel like regardless of my wife's actions, I need to continue to teach my daughter my values. AITA?",1
"A bit of context:  I'm Filipino-American. My parents are both from the Philippines, moved here about 30 years ago, VERY intelligent and understand American culture. We are very much culturally Filipino. As any Asian culture, there is A LOT of emphasis on respect. In our family and extended family, it's almost imperative to greet each other warmly as well as well as saying goodbye to each other when leaving. Her mother had her very young (at 20) and my mother had me much later (in her mid 30s) so as you can tell, the family dynamics are very different. I am very close with her family.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 4 years now. She is American, born and raised.

I was raised to always greet everyone in the household and properly say goodbye and ""thank you for having me/having me over."" This is normal for my family. Honestly, for me it's a fucking no brainer. When we first started dating, she was having trouble grasping this, especially when it came to saying the goodbyes. Often she would just walk out and leave without acknowledging my parents. My parents pulled me aside and told me this. I thought OK that sucks but we can talk it out and I can make her understand. I know we are all raised differently and have different customs, so I pulled my GF aside and explained this to her. She was receptive and she began to greet them and say goodbye properly. Initially she was a bit cold/shut off to my parents but they gradually warmed up to her. Not that they didn't get along but she just had her walls up for some reason. I think she was probably intimidated. But almost 4 years later and they get a lot quite well now.

Last week, I noticed her grandfather was really in the need for a TV upgrade. It just so happens my parents have a old 40"" plasma sitting around so I asked if we could give it to him. They said sure. My GF and I went to pick it up from my parents, then dropped it off at her grandfather's. He was super happy and appreciative. Not long after that, my sister texts me and says that when we were there at the house picking up the TV, my GF didn't say goodbye to my father or thanks when she left. This pissed me off. First of all, it's super embarrassing and we've had this issue before, she knows better.

We talked tonight and I chastised her. How on earth could you go into someone's home, take something and not even say thank you? I told her I was tired of hearing it and being embarrassed. She retorted with, ""Well I'm tired of being nitpicked at. It's always going to be something."" She got defensive and pissed off. Apparently she said thank you to him, just not when we left. The talk did not end well. I just can't get it through to her head that this a big deal in my family. I wouldn't even dream of treating her parents the same way. AITA for calling her out?",1
"Edit: after further talking to my mom she is in disbelief. She had talked to my sister telling her she is willing to help but also will need to take care of my daughter. She also explained she isn’t able to stay up late/pull all nighters because that physically/mentally puts a strain on her.

 My sister doesn’t share her birth plan, as I did with her. I knew she wants our mom, yes, but to stay at her home and help out. To be with her all of labor and delivery, no, that my mom told me Thursday night. 

Yes, I knew my sister was pregnant . But it’s one thing to have a scheduled induction and another to naturally go into labor. The point being I would and am taking the time off, my mom will be by her side. 

I have my mom telling me one thing and my sister not keeping me in the loop of what she is thinking.

\_\_\_  
So yesterday I found out from my mom my sister is being induced Sunday to have her baby. I never heard a peep from her (my sister) on the situation and her plans.

Me, 37F, with a one year old, most likely my one and only as I’m single and I had her via donated sperm, and work full time . My sister late 40s, married, works part-time (>20hrs/wk), with a 21 yo daughter, having the first male child on both sides of the family.

She and my mom were at my labor and delivery. I had a serious complication after delivery where I needed 2hrs of surgery and blood transfusions. They were both there. Reminder I am spouse less and forever grateful they were there.

My mom takes care of my daughter while I work. My sister wants our mom with her at her labor and delivery, then to help with the baby for the week. Leaving me needing to take time off from a job where I teach special needs kiddos. I was always planning to take time off for when my sister goes into labor but I don’t think she really considers the position I’m in or even tries to listens.

I guess I am the asshole for asking my mom to watch my daughter a few hours Monday morning as it’s a new school semester. The kiddos have a new class they’re starting and we will be super short staffed that day. I’m asking 3 hrs. Holy shit she went into hysterical mode. Full on crying, shaking, “I don’t know my priorities”, I did the most offensive thing possible. F it I took the time off. Who care about the job that supports me and my daughter?

Could I find a babysitter? Sure. I will try. But I don’t want to leave her with someone I don’t trust. I’m very protective, her being my first and only. It took me 1.5 months to find a daycare that she will start in February. And I need to find a babysitter in 3 days? I don’t know …I guess I could have looked earlier but was busy with daycare searching, work, and then caring for my baby.

I’m just sad that I can’t talk things out with my sister. She goes into full rage, hysterical mode when her plans feel like it’s not going her way. I only wanted a grown conversation, to discuss the situation. But it’s her way or her way. It’s baby number 2 for her with a caring, attentive husband.

Maybe I am the asshole. But she knows I would and will do anything for her and our family. I asked for 3 hours and with that it placed a fracture in our relationship. This school year with family and work has been so stressful and strained I don’t know how to find the balance - I am trying my best.",1
"I (50F) lost my husband 4 years ago. I also have a 16yo daughter.

My late husband left me everything and told me to trust his lawyer. My husband had worked for 20 years as a doctor and did some minor investing so I inherited over 7 figures.

A year later, I decided to list our home of 12 years and received an offer too good to refuse. With the inheritance as well as the influx of cash from selling the house, I decided to move my daughter and I to Malibu because we always dreamed of a home next to the beach but my husband was exceptionally tight fisted and called homes there money pits.

We found a beautiful home by the sea. I never personally handled anything regarding buying a home before so I did not anticipate all the extra costs beyond the sticker price. 

But my daughter was so excited so I decided to go for it. My late husband's lawyer was furious at my decision so I decided stopped taking his calls. I ended up signing with a money manager who said that we'd be passively earning 90 percent of what surgeons earned per year.

But the money manager ended up tanking a lot of our investments. I took the dwindling money out and made my own investments which made it worse and long story short, because of all that I only have around $35k available to me now., not to mention our debts.

With the amount available to me, I am looking at only being able to pay 1 month of a mortgage/ upkeep and then I'm basically out of luck until my business gets clients. However, the place where we do have a significant amount of money is the fund my husband started for our daughter. With the money there, I could prevent our credit cards from being shut down, and not have to worry about the mortgage for many more months. 

So I ended up liquidating my daughter's college fund. I told her about it today and she was furious and said she cannot believe all her dad's work is gone. Shea slo said she won't be supporting me for retirement. AITA for trying to fix my mistakes and trying to keep our house?",1
"Despite trying to conceive for years and having no success with her husband every month, my sister (31F) felt like a supreme disappointment. Her head knew she was not at fault, but she was saying that not being able to give her husband ""the gift of children"", which is seen to most people as a wifely duty made her feel broken and not whole. 

Finally she consulted her doctor, only to be diagnosed with endometriosis. A simple surgery, which was scheduled for last week, was supposed to correct the problem. She was ecstatic. Only to come out of anesthesia and be told by the doctor that he is sorry but children would not be an option. 

As you can imagine, she felt devasted by these news. Yesterday I went to visit her to try to lift her spirits. I told her how incredibly sorry I was. But then I also added that being infertile may not be all that bad. Raising kids isn't all sunshine and roses. There is the added stress, expenses, sleep deprivation and time commitment. I told her to look at all the unhappy couples with kids, and that at least she and her husband would enjoy some extra freedom.

After these comments, my sister's sadness turned into anger. She started shouting at me and told me to leave her house. She had also informed our mother because she called me later to tell me that my comments were disgusting and I should feel ashamed of myself. I feel like me trying to help my sister only made the situation worse.",1
"Yesterday, my parents sat me (31 M), my two brothers (32M, 34M) and my sister (41 F) down to discuss their will. My parents informed us that they want to split it five ways, my sister gets 2/5 while the three of us brothers get 1/5 each. Their reasoning is that my sister ""sacrificed"" her childhood for our family so its only fair she gets compensated.

In our childhood, my father's business partner screwed him over so there was a period where we were broke and in debt. My parents had to work multiple jobs to keep us afloat, and my sister babysat us while our parents worked. All she had to do was feed us and keep an eye on us. We were pretty calm kids so all we did was play games and do our homework. It probably wasn't thrilling, but not exactly a tremendous hardship. 

I complained to my parents along with my brothers that its insane they want to give my sister 2/5 of the inheritance over that, especially since she's financially the best off out of all of us. She doesn't have any kids and a dual income with her partner. 

My parents said they're disappointed in us, and said we need to reflect on ourselves. My sister didn't say shit while my parents spoke, but texted us afterwards that she had zero intention of taking 2/5 but we were all assholes.

AITA for feeling like this split is unfair?",1
"Some background: My wife is a makeup artist, She always has those heavy makeup looks on which can be weird for me as guy sometimes, but she loves it and enjoys it so no problems there. though my friends and family tend to make funny, lighthearted comments on her makeup which she seems to take too seriously.


Now the situation, My 27th birthday was few days ago. we celebrated at a small diner with my guy friends and my wife. now my guy friends are brutally honest and make jokes and tease all the time, my wife knows how they are so no surprises there.

Anyways, My wife took a miute to use the toilet to get her makeup fixed as me and the boys were chatting. when she got back she asked me how she looked and before I could answer, My friend Austin responded by jokingly saying ""Damn, you look like you just got out of the cancer ward with that heavy makeup on your face!"". the rest of the guys started laughing and I just stared at my wife. she got very upset and started arguing with Austin about how awful he was. others joined in and there was so much comotion. I felt upset that they were fighting during my birthday celebration. I asked my wife to calm down and take a seat but she asked if I was okay with my friends making fun of her. Austin said ""come on It was a joke!"" I threw my habds up and said that I admit that my wife overreacted because really it was a joke, She lashed out on me and took an uber home. The party was cut short and when I got home we began arguing. I told her she overreacted and that she shouldn't take everything seriously knowing how great she always looks but she turned it into an argument about how I let my friends insult her, and how I should've defended her and her integrity after I basically ""forced"" thise guys upon her when she was the ine who arranged for this enitre celebration.

All I wanted was for her to say sorry instead of making excuses. She just couldn't do it. She got drunk and cried all night even when I tried to make it better.

"Long time lurker, first time poster, English is not my first language. I hope I’ll get some inside wisdom with this post.


My fiancee and I are getting married soon and her sister is her bridesmaid. However, SIL won’t come to the wedding if her boyfriend (Nick) isn’t invited or welcome. 
I don’t know Nick very well, but what I heard and know about him, I’m not very keen on having him in our wedding. 


When we announced that we were getting married, and before we invited anyone, Nick invited himself. That rubbed me already the wrong way. His reason was that he hasn’t been to a lot of weddings yet. For context, my wedding will be the first wedding I’ll attend, so his reason is not that strong in my opinion. He already tried to come unannounced to our home when my SIL was staying there for an internship she had and expected to be fine with us. In hindsight, I shouldn’t be that surprised that he invited himself.


Furthermore, my ILs don’t want him to be left at home (their home where he also lives), because they don’t trust him to be left alone there. So, when Nick comes to my home, I’ll have to keep an eye out, which will probably cause more stress on that day. 


For my fiancee, family is really important and that is why I’m thorn about this question. I know that it’s my wedding too, but my fiancee will be heartbroken, if her sister isn’t there because Nick isn’t invited. 


So, would I be the asshole if I didn’t invite him, resulting in my SIL not being there and therefore ruining my fiancee's happiness?


**EDIT**


Some people asked for a little bit more information way I don't want him to be there and what my fiancee is thinking of him.


My fiancee is on the same page as me if we're talking about Nick. She also found it quite impolite that he just invited himself even before we send out the invitations (still haven't send them). We did talk about not inviting him. However, her dislike of him is less than her love of her sister, and ""wants"" him to be there if that means that her sister is there. I still haven't made a choice in this matter, that's why I made this post. (We're still thinking about having no +1s, because of restrictions, so he'll be the exception in that case)


Yes, he does live with my ILs, however, he never asked and they never agreed. He just slept there one night and never left. He's also controlling, like my SIL has to go where he's going and the other way around, and she cannot wear ""sexy"" cloth (her words). I think he doesn't trust her to go to a wedding alone. My biggest reason for him not to be there is that he took stuff from my ILs and when confronted, he didn't make a big deal out of it.",1
"My wife had a baby ten days ago.

&#x200B;

Before she had the baby, she said she wanted to breastfeed. She still says she wants to breastfeed.

&#x200B;

Baby had poor sucking coordination in the hospital for the first day or two.. He did better on the bottle and we started feeding him formula in the hospital.

&#x200B;

At feeding times, I would suggest she keep up trying to breast feed, him and she would resist saying ""My milk hasn't come in yet"" or ""I'll breast feed him once we are home.""

&#x200B;

Now we're home and the kid isn't breast feeding well, so we're feeding him formula which I'm concerned will just encourage him to give up breast feeding entirely.

&#x200B;

Took her to a lactation consultant this week who said the kid may need his tongue clipped but also said she should be using a particular nipple shield. Bought the nipple shield. She decided after one attempt that the nipple shield doesn't work. 

&#x200B;

So half the feedings are formula only, half the feedings are 5-10 minutes of unsuccessful attempted breast feeding followed by formula.

&#x200B;

We also bought a pumping machine before the child was born so she could pump milk. She started using it a few days ago.

&#x200B;

The nurse instructions and every online resource say ""pump every 2-3 hours, 8-10 times a day, so your body keeps replacing milk and you build up more milk production."" They also say ""Don't be discouraged with low output for the first 2 weeks. Keep at it.""

&#x200B;

She is pumping on a less rigid schedule of every 4 - 5.5 hours and getting like 1/3 of an ounce per pump session and complaining that ""I have no milk."" She's only been ""at it"" for three days and hasn't pumped 8-10 times in a 24 hour period once and is averaging 6 times a day.

&#x200B;

Today she pumped at 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. when the baby woke us up, then slept until 9, then woke up and took a shower, got dressed, started making breakfast/lunch. At 10:45 a.m. I finally asked ""why aren't you pumping?"" and suggested ""I think you could have pumped at 9 a.m. when you woke up and then your body could be making milk while you're doing all this other stuff for an hour.""

&#x200B;

And her response is to cry and ask ""Don't you think i'm trying"" and my non-diplomatic response was ""No, I don't think you're trying because you're only pumping every five hours not every three."" I should have phrased that better, I admit.

&#x200B;

She still says she wants to breastfeed and wants to pump milk. She claims she doesn't want to just switch to straight formula, though I suspect that is what she wants. I think she feels like a failure because the baby isn't breastfeeding and the milk isn't coming and just wants to quit.

&#x200B;

I would prefer that the baby get the nutritional benefit of breast milk (as would she) and that we not spend $1,500 - $2,000 a year for formula when she might be able to pump it herself.  So I want her to keep trying on 2-3 hour schedule for a few weeks before she gives up.

"I (20M) am having a bit of an argument with my significant other (20F) and I would like to know if I’m being an asshole in this scenario. I am a university student in Florida, United States in my third year working g towards my bachelors degree. My girlfriend is graduating with her associate’s degree in 5-6 months and plans to get a degree in teaching soon after. We have been together for almost 2 years and are very deeply in love with each other. Our relationship has gotten to the point where we had mentioned getting engaged and talked about when we would like to get engaged. My girlfriend mentioned that she wanted to get engaged around 2-3 years when she graduates from college at 22 while I said that I would like to wait until til I graduate with my juris doctorate (law degree) which would come out to be at age 24 almost 25. While I have not applied to law school, I plan on attending law school no matter any other circumstance as this is my dream. My goal was to wait until I finish my juris doctorate degree before getting engaged as it allows for more financial freedom and also allows for my girlfriend and I to spend some time living together before we get engaged. She believes that I am not compromising and that I am trying to change her life while I believe that she does not understand my point of view. While I think she is rushing this scenario, I feel like I’m being a bad boyfriend and not compromising enough here. AITA for not wanting to rush?",1
"I’m currently staying with my in-laws. Before we came to visit my mother-in-law asked me what pregnancy cravings I was having because she wanted to make sure they had them for me. I mostly crave chocolate fudge brownie ice cream and they bought a lot of it for me.

I was eating it directly out of the tub since it never lasts more than two days max and nobody else was eating it as far as I was aware. My mother-in-law’s goddaughter has been here for a few days now too and she saw me eating the ice cream from the tub and told me I was being gross because somebody else could’ve wanted some and I should use a bowl instead of just eating it directly from the tub. I told her I was going to eat it all anyway and she accused me of being greedy. I started crying because we kept arguing over it and she was making me feel awful. 

My husband saw me crying and was furious with her. My mother-in-law has been trying to smooth things over between everybody but my husband is still angry at her and she’s still angry at me because she thinks I cried on purpose to make him angry at her.

"My (f30) brother (40) met his wife (38) in college, they got married 10 years ago and now have two kids (f8 and m6). I never liked her much because I’ve always felt she’s just with him for his money, and I’ll explain why. They both finished their degrees but she never got a job out of it, he did. He earns a good salary but she has never worked to contribute to their household. Then they had kids and she would use the kids as an excuse to why she couldn’t work, which is whatever, but my niece and newphew are in school now and all she does during the day is go to yoga with her friends, and get her nails and face done. Me, on the other hand I’m a single mother of a 3 year old and work as well. 
The other day we were on a family zoom call and brothers wife said “I’m so stressed right now” or something like that and it annoyed me so I said “I’m working and have a child to look after on my own what do you have to be stressed about?” Everyone went silent and my brother ended his call on the end. My Mom and Dad told me I was out of line but I explained that she is using my brother for his money so she can sit there and look pretty, they said they some what agree but it isn’t their business, well he is my brother and I care about him.
My brother sent me a text saying that until I apologise he doesn’t want me to around him, his wife or their kids. 
I don’t see why I have to apologise just because I told it how it is.

"hi ! so i know what the title sounds like &’ i am kinda conflicted on everything but please read the whole text

some context: i (18F) have recently got a cat (3M) in my shared dorm (2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, &’ a living room) in which my roommates were okay with &’ even encouraged me to get. i got her from a previous friend who could not take care of her. when i got her, i was told that she was spayed &’ had her shots. we needed to make a vet appointment due to an outside circumstance &’ when we went (jan 17th) that is when i was told she was not spayed &’ most likely didnt have her shots. that day i made an appointment to get her spayed but the earliest date they had was feb 29.

now here is where i am conflicted: she went into heat yesterday. my roommates were aware that this would be happening as i kept them updated because it is their home too. she was meowing &’ trying to sleep on the bunk bed &’ going up there at night. my roommate kept getting upset when she was on the bed &’ when she was crying so i attempted to calm her down which was successful until my roommate heard her meowing in the living room &’ went to pet her after i told her not to. after that my cat was following her. later on the night at about 1am i went next door to my friends dorm to go talk to them &’ got a text that i need to take the cat next door &’ need to go w her. i feel like i shouldnt have gotten kicked out of my room because i pay 1800/m to be there as well lmao

so can someone tell me; AITA for all of this ?

edit: she is 3 months, not 3, male. 

edit 2: the reason why everything is so extremely frustrating to the max &’ more than just “my roommate is mad bc my cat isnt spayed” but i was physically told to LEAVE MY PLACE that i pay for &’ am staying w my bf for the week. i shouldnt have had to physically leave the place i pay for just as much as she does.

"I (19f) is the second oldest out of my 8 younger siblings the first oldest move out. Some context I reticently had to switch rooms because of what my little brother did to my little sister. My third sister we can call her ( J ) and My oldest brother ( L ). Me and Mom along with ( J ), (L) and My dad had this talk we're ( J ) is supposed stay in the room where the rest of the younger kids are in to make sure they were watch properly (Which made no-senses because ( J ) never watched them she always ignored them until i gotten their). L was the only thing that changed because he was moving out of the house. 

Meaning i'd have a room to myself, I was really excited to have a room to myself because i could show off (my girls) without being shamed about it especially if i was doing it in secrete to surprises my Husband. But ( J ) was persistent on moving into the same room where ( L ) just moved out of. ( J ) kept on asking, asking for two days until my mom finial  gave up and agreed once J move into the room she started nagging at me about the corner spiders that are around the room and when ever she gets the chance to play any PS games she just ignores us when we need her to do basic chores. My mother even said it to me she didn't want J to move in the same room with me because my mom knows J will ignores us until she gets mad at us for making her lose at a game. 

 I'd thought i should add that My mom gets food stamps that are normally for the house and J. (Mostly meant for J tho. i say this because J will make an entire list of junk food for my mom to go get for her. My mom even told me since J had a serious beathing problem when she was an infant my mom will always be on J's side. But J isn't an infant anymore she a 17 year old girl, she coughs in her sleep but she still okay! Whenever J is with my mom she get's soda, chips, candy and brunch of other things that are not house necessity.)  

I feel i might be the TA In this part because I just woke up in the afternoon I called my mom because one of my brothers weren't helping the other one with their chore (Both boys share the same chore) and J answered the phone so i told J to let mom know that the boys weren't doing their chores than my grandma ask what day was it and i mistake it for it being Tuesdays than J, and I yelled it was Wednesdays  and it made my grandma confuses so I yelled at J to Shut up and go stuff her faces with food J hung up on me. Than my mom came home yell at me on how i was being uncalled for telling J to go stuff her face with food. My mom kept yelling at me ""You don't know if J eats or not."" (she does eat. J won't touch her food until it gets cold) I told mom it was the truth and she just doesn't want stop babying J after i said that i walked upstairs'  AITA?  

Edit: Its a bit confusing to understand but I hope I can clear it up . (J is 17 years old and who is also my third younger sister) and (L is 20 year old and who is also my older brother) When I was typing this post I was crying all over the place. But now that I'm slightly calmer I can see that I'm the TA",1
"My wife and I have a 16 year old son who I'll just be referring to as Jay for this post. Jay is a good kid, he does well in school, helps us with household chores and has always been a very happy boy. For the past few years he's been drawn to very androgynous/feminine clothing. He would rather wear a pair of skinny jeans and a girls sweater or long (almost dress like) shirts. He also grew his hair out a couple years back and, though it is kept short on the back and sides, it is a very obviously feminine haircut. 

I have also noticed when I've overheard him talking with his friends that they all seem to be calling him a feminine version of his name (Heath - Heather, Lawrence - Laurie, Jack - Jackie etc.). 

This does not bother me in the slightest. As long as my son is happy and not hurting anyone then I am happy to let him do whatever he wants to be comfortable. However, this is where the problem begins.

My uncle (Jay's great uncle) has to move in with us for a couple of weeks. He is getting construction done in his home and will not be able to stay there till it's done. He is very set in his ways. He's a very typical ""men should be out working and women should be at home with the kids"" type of man. We were never particularly close, a large part of this was down to his extremely outdated beliefs, but no one else can take him in and it is only for a few weeks. After that, we can go back to keeping him at arms length. 

I sat down with my son and my wife and mentioned that Jay should probably dress normally and just stick to wearing jeans and t shirts instead of his preferred clothing whilst my uncle is staying with us. I also brought up the nickname and asked him if he could ask his friends to call him by his real name in can my uncle overhears and starts asking questions. It was all just to avoid confrontation. He's already a bitter man, I don't want to give him any reason to complain. 

Jay agreed but I could tell he was unhappy. My wife thinks I'm being an AH for asking our son to change his style of clothing to accommodate my uncle. I think she was over exaggerating a little as it is only for a few weeks then Jay can go back to his other clothes. I just don't want the house to be tense all the time while he's here.

"For some context, my (24) friend (26) is from Colombia. We both currently live in North America. I’m not an economist, but a VERY simplified explanation is that the dollar gains value in Colombia while the peso loses value in North America. That being said, here’s what happened: I planned a trip for me, my friend V and my other friend L. L and I had talked about this trip for a while and I used to live in the city we wanted to visit for 6 years before moving, hence why she wanted to visit. I’m in grad school with V and she and L were already friends as well, so naturally we invited V to join us. We looked for hotels/Airbnb’s but ultimately decided to stay with my parents despite the fact that they live far away from downtown in order to save money on the trip. Our only guaranteed expense for the trip then became the cost of the rental car. About a week before the trip, V tells me she doesn’t think she wants to go anymore and that she feels she will spend too much money, that she can’t afford it, and that she’s worried it’ll be a mistake. I encouraged her to go. She ultimately agreed, and afterwards I joked saying “oh good because we need you to drive”. She laughed. We joke around a lot so I thought nothing of this in the moment, and she even, while laughing, joked back “oh wow ok so if I’m driving you guys need to pay for all my food”. We both laughed and started planning our trip. The first day was great but then V began to get very quiet and distant. She became very snippy and short with us and was ultimately unpleasant to be around. L was very mad, and I knew V was upset about having to spend money (we went out to eat but not at very expensive places, average $10-20), so I wanted to apologize and offer to pay for her on the trip. L discouraged me saying “you’re not her accountant, if she knew she couldn’t afford it she shouldn’t have come. She’s ruining our trip. You should give her space”. I decided to give V space during our trip, but still always invited her to go on our outings which she started to refuse the invites. The trip ended with us laughing and getting along and singing to music on the drive back. However, after we got back V wasn’t speaking with me. This is where I think I might be the asshole: I couldn’t think of anything to say to open a conversation with V, but I knew she would get money on the 15th of the coming month. I went to her and said “hey do you mind paying me back for your portion of the rental car when you get a chance?” Expecting her to ask “can I pay you on the 15th?” To which I would say “of course no problem”. She got very angry and handed me half and said “There. Now I only owe you half”. Things have been tense in class, and I’ve tried to apologize several times but she still won’t speak to me, it’s been about 2 months. AITA?",1
"Hi all,  
M13 (soon to be 14) here. As of my adolescent years, my relationship with my parents has grown bad. I don't try to cooperate with my parents because of past trauma and me simply not seeing any point of cooperating with my parents.

  
By no means am i a neglected child, or not have basic rights, far from it. I would actually say I am on the spoiled side of children. I have many privileges, like going to private school, having a phone, a laptop, a home computer, and a gaming console. I also do great in school. Throughout my elementary school and middle school years, I have gotten excellent grades, and i maintained a 3.8 GPA. As of this year, my last middle school year, I take 3 high school classes, and do better than the highschoolers in them.

My parents don't believe that I'm doing good at school, because I don't tell them most things. They always want me to ""try harder"", or ""be better"" when I don't want to try better. They believe that I should study harder, study more often, and get less distracted by things such as my phone, or video games.

In recent instances, they also believe my friends are a distraction to me, and that my friends are the bad person. Most recently I hung out with my friend until 10pm, took a shower, and went to bed, on a school day. (I did not notify them where I was going to be, and with who I was going to be.)

My parents say they see potential in me, when I don't see the potential in myself, and they don't show how they see my potential. They also want to guide me, and they want to show me how to do things in life, while I want to explore those things myself. In addition to that, they also want to know what happened when with who at all times. (sorry for complicated sentence.)

 I believe it isn't healthy for me to try and cooperate with my parents for an extended amount of time. My parents used to verbally abuse me when i was about 6-10 years old, and since then i have distanced myself and isolated myself from my parents. I remember misbehaving, or my mom getting calls from the teacher to notify that i had one or two missing assignments, and then her screaming at me for not doing better. I also clearly remember being called ""a loser"" and an ""idiot"" by my parents, very often. It is now a core memory of mine. Earliest I can remember this happening is when i was 7.  


I just had a talk with my parents 2 hours ago, about me not doing well in school. That is an absolute lie that they believe so much in, I don't even bother trying to tell them otherwise. They said that I would get all my privileges taken away, and that they would lock me inside the house and disenroll me from school. This has been a recurring event, and it doesn't include only these threats, but threats of physical harm as well.

So tell me, AITA?

"My wife Liz had a horrible childhood. She was and is extremely intelligent. She's practically a human calculator as well as being able to speak several languages fluently. Her talents came out when she was very young and she did extremely well academically, passing all her exams early and even getting university offers in her early teens. Her parents put a huge amount of pressure on her. They forced her to study constantly and refused to let her see any of her friends or even leave the house at all during some periods. 

Liz eventually ran away from home and lived with a friend's family. Unfortunately the scars from her childhood still affect her. With her mind and her academic achievements, she could do anything she wants. Instead she works at the checkout in a shop. She only ever wears plain clothes and never wears jewellery or makeup. Obviously it isn't my place to tell her what to wear, but Liz actively doesn't want to stand out. She wants to blend in and be as average as possible, the opposite of what her parents wanted. 

We have a daughter, Claire, who is 18, and we were both adamant that she would get a normal childhood. She's got her mother's talents. From her early school years she was always top of the class. Her teachers even offered her to move up a couple of years because she's so advanced, but she turned it down to stay with her friends, which we respected. 

Claire is a very outgoing person. She loves going to parties and spending time with her friends, and is a happy, bubbly kid. She's still a high achiever and has applied to an elite university to study mathematics. 

Like many girls her age Claire is into fashion and clothes and shoes etc. Yesterday she asked Liz for money to buy some new stuff, which resulted in an argument between them when Liz said she's asking too often (she bought a few dresses last week). 

Later Liz was still annoyed, saying that Claire takes everything for granted and that she doesn't understand how comfortable her childhood has been. I asked Liz if she was sure she wasn't jealous of Claire and if she doesn't wish she had the life we've given her. 

Liz got extremely upset and asked how I could say that to her. She stormed off, and when I went to bed, she was crying and told me she wanted to be alone.

"I (27, female) really care for my sister and my brother-in-law, BUT my ex from 5 years ago is his cousin AND friend, and he is invited with his new girlfriend. My sister, Mary (30, female), and my brother-in-law, Austin (29), got married last year. This is the first time since my breakup that we have an event where both of us are invited.  
My ex (31, male) and I (27, female) were in a 5-year relationship. Overall, it was good, and we wanted to get married, but we faced some troubles and ended the relationship in March. Two or three months later, he was already dating another girl. I was devastated because deep inside, I thought we were going to work through our issues. I have never felt more alone in my life. We not only shared a group of friends but also had a lot of family connections, like Austin.  
Now, nine months later, I am not fully healed, and I am still working on it. In two weeks, Austin will celebrate his 30th birthday with a big party, and people will stay the night at his lake house. He invited my ex because they are cousins and have been really good friends long before he dated my sister. When we were together, the four of us became really close and did everything together. But I know I am not as important to Austin as my ex is.  
Since his new girlfriend (they have been together for six months) is invited too, at first, I was going to attend. But when my sister told me, she said right away that I shouldn't get exposed to them together, and if my ex doesn't go, I should go. I was on board with this, but it really makes me feel that he is more wanted and loved than me.  
This is something that I always feared, that people love him more than me. (He is very outgoing and funny, while I am more calm and quiet, not that extroverted.) Since then, apparently, my ex replied that he is not going. But now I don't want to go. I don't want to feel like the second choice; damn, I even feel like the leftovers.

My sister was really angry when I told her and said that he will now miss two important people on his special day. But I felt like he didn't care at all whether I went or not.

I haven't sent my response yet but am I overreacting? Should I just go?""",1
"This happened three years ago and my daughter ""Mallory"" still resents us for this.  I'm asking now because my son is going to be starting the eighth grade next school year, permitting that schools will reopen again and this event isn't cancelled.  

At my kid's school, there is a big annual spring break trip to New York City and Washington D.C.  It's something that most of the kids, including my own, were looking forward to.  When Mallory started the sixth grade, she talked about wanting to go on the trip.  We said she could, so long as she got good grades and didn't get into trouble.

When she was in the seventh grade, her aunt Linda got engaged and set her wedding date for the following year.  This was going to include a big family reunion with all the relatives because Linda was the last of my siblings to get married (big fat Catholic family), many of whom we haven't seen in years.  Unfortunately, Linda planned her wedding to take place the same week as Mallory's 8th grade spring break.  

We ended having to tell Mallory that she couldn't go on the trip afterall because everyone was going to be going to the wedding instead.  Like I said, this was going to include a family reunion, and it may be the last time we got to see some relatives including her great-grandparents for a long time.  

Mallory was heartbroken.  We offered to take a family trip to New York, but she turned it down because she wanted to go with friends and not family.  Understandable.  

Cut to the week of the wedding a year later.  We flew out to New Mexico for the ceremony and crash at my sister's (not the bride's) house.  Mallory is still upset about having to be in New Mexico when all of her friends are in New York.  A few days before the ceremony was to take place, Linda called off the wedding.  

Mallory was furious.  I can still remember her blow up.  She screamed, ""so I missed my trip for nothing?""  and stormed off into the room she was sharing with her cousins and wouldn't let anyone in.  

It was a mess afterward.  I tried to cheer Mallory up by offering to take her sight seeing or go see a movie with her cousins, but she refused.  I gave up after she refused to go to the movies with us, saying that she didn't want to watch a 'dumb kids movie with a bunch of babies' (while she is the oldest of the cousins, the next nearest cousin in age was nine at the time).  Mallory refused to speak to us during the flight back.  To this day, she's still angry at her aunt Linda.  

I know Mallory was upset, but no one could have predicted that the wedding would be called off.  We have tried to make it up to her, but she has refused every offer.  I know she wants a trip with her friends, but that New York trip is expensive and many of her friend's parents were not willing to spend more money on another outing for the girls.  

Because of this, Mallory thinks I am an asshole.  Am I?",1
"TLDR: My daughter's (9) cat keeps pooping on the floor, and I'm considering getting rid of the cat.

Background:

Just before my ex and I separated, our 17 year old cat had to be put down. Our daughter (9) was devastated as she considered this quiet, old cat ""hers,"" as my ex and I each had our own dog at the time.

Two months later, my daughter and I moved out of the family home and several states away. I figured a low-key pet of her own, another cat, would help her through the transition of her parents splitting up, moving away, starting at a new school, etc.

In my search for a new cat or kitten, I had seen two kittens that I loved (because you can't get just one kitten). By the time I was able to get to the adoption center, one of the kittens had already been adopted, so I was resigned to getting just the one. My daughter and I went to the adoption event where she got to hold the male kitten I was interested in. It was a busy Saturday in a Petsmart with a dozen puppies in cages also for adoption, and the kitten was none too pleased, so he hissed at my daughter. She immediately was no longer interested in this male kitten, but I was determined to get him. There was a female kitten (sister to the male I wanted) that rubbed herself along the side of the crate and was purring loudly as my daughter placed her hand there. So, we ended up walking out with two kittens (cause you can't get just one!)

We've now had the cats almost two years. The male is undeniable moreso ""my"" cat, while the female loves my daughter. This cat sleeps with her at night and, in general, just hangs out with her a lot more. In therapy, my daughter says that this cat (and the dog she ended up getting post-divorce) really helps her feel happy when she is sad. This issue is that for the past 8 months or so, my daughter's cat will not use the litter box to poop in instead, preferring to defecate on the floor right next to the litter box.

At first, I moved a litter box to the area she was pooping (in the kitchenette). When that didn't solve the issue, I placed both litter boxes there. When that didn't solve the issue, I switched from pellet litter to Skoon (a pebble type litter). She didn't take to the litter change, so I tried Skoon's fine grain. Nope. I've changed litter two more times. She's still not pooping in the litter box. Mind you, she has always used the box, no matter the litter type to urinate. My last resort has been to tape down aluminum foil to cover the ground where she generally poops.

I am sick and tired of cleaning the floor every day, only for it to be shat on again in a few hours. It's absolutely disgusting and embarrassing. I told my daughter that I am no longer cleaning up after her cat and that if she doesn't stay on top of cleaning it up, the cat is going to have to go. I am at my wits end...

So, WIBTA, if I gave her cat away?


 *** UPDATE ***

Have y'all ever seen that meme that says if you really need advice on a topic, go to reddit and post a question, then follow it up with a comment from an alternate account with very bad advice on that question... because people love to correct rather than help? I knew y'all would pull through for me.

So, without further ado ... my kitty has a vet apt on Monday, and I'll update y'all with the results.


Other burning questions or topics:
● Why didn't I take her to the vet to begin with?
Well, I live out in the country, so there is a fair bit of animal husbandry that we attend to without immediately taking our animals to the vet. Because she was pooping on the floor and not peeing on the floor, my first instinct was to figure out if it was something in the home that was bothering her, ergo address the behavior.

Again, as everything ELSE about her seemed normal, e.g., eating, drinking, mobility, personality, and even ""poop pattern,"" my first immediate thought wasn't rectal pain.

Thank you to everyone who shared stories of their kitties that had similar problems and some potential causes. And special thanks to those who reached out via dm. I hope there is something the vet can do because Duck aka Ducky-doo aka Sweety Belle (as she is affectionately called) is an important member of our home.

● How many litter boxes do I have?
We do have three litter boxes. Two are close together, and one is in another room. She uses all three, as does her brother, but she only poops in one area of the house.

● Animal relationships 
Duck and her brother Raven get along about as well as any other brother and sister. They lay next to and groom each other, they leave each other alone, and they play fight... and Duck certainly gives as good as she gets. They are NOT declawed. They ARE fixed. They were both ADOPTED from a local rescue org. Duck gets along great with the other animals in the home (2 dogs). No one is watching her or bothering her while she uses the potty.

● Traumatizing my daughter
Ah yes... I actually had to give up two dogs when I was a kid, and it broke me. Have I thought, in anger, about giving the cat away? Oh, hell yes. But, despite destroying my house in all sorts of ways, she's the sweetest and a great companion for my daughter.

Yes, the cat is very much my daughter's cat, and if she ever heard me say it was my cat or even our cat, she'd be very quick to correct me. The language I used was to honor my daughter's relationship with her cat, not distance myself from a living being under my care.

● Definition of ""argue""
: give reasons or cite evidence in support of an idea, action, or theory, typically with the aim of persuading others to share one's view.
: exchange or express diverging or opposite views, typically in a heated or angry way.

Some of y'all need to go read a dictionary. There is a difference between providing additional context to a situation or answering questions/responses and trying to argue against taking an animal to the vet. Holy hell... go touch some grass.",1
"So my (41M) have a daughter (16F) and she likes reading. So when libraries were still open, she went and got like 15 books , and she *even* has a list of books she wants to read (30+ books on the list) and she even has access to a website so she can read.

I'd be totally fine with this, if she didn't spend the whole day reading. Sure, she still does chores,  but any free time she reads. I don't want it to affect her eyesight, but she doesn't even watch t.v anymore, and anytime not reading or doing chores will be spent talking to her friends. She is a very social girl and has lots of friends but I feel this is impacting her social and home life.

It's become and issue so much, that taking away her phone doesn't work. Her brother is becoming more easier to work with, since sometimes she gets zoned out and we have to shake her back to reality.

So we have this chore list/timings. Her brother (15M) does chores 2 days a week, while she does the same chores 2 days a week and I and my wife do the rest 3 days a week with some help from both of them. Everyone has to have their rooms clean by the end of the day, no matter what day.

So today was her day to clean the dishes, set the table, and clean the living room area, and help her mother/or me with cooking.

So she did only 2.5/4. She didn't clean all dishes and the help she gave wasnt satisfactory. It was rushed and I had to threaten her books to make her help her mother with less rushing.

When I found out she only cleaned half the dishes I told her to clean all of them, because she *forgot* and then while she was cleaning I took away her books, and put a small note on her computer that she's banned from those book websites.

When she found out, she went ballistic. Saying that it's so boring in quarantine, and that I'm being so mean to her. I told her she can talk to her friends or watch t.v, these books aren't everything.

She started arguing more and more literally pleading , and I told her fine, but she can only read an hour a day.

She told me I'm being unreasonable, and is now ignoring me and probably venting to her friends or something. 

She keeps saying to atleast let her read online, but my answer is the same.

My wife told me I should stop it, and that I should be encouraging her to read, not the opposite. I told her that she should take her chores more seriously and both my wife and son disagree with me, since him and my daughter are close.

I just need to know, aita?

{Edit}~

Alright, I read through...a few responses (going to watch Matilda today or tomorrow since so many people referenced it) so I gave her back her books, but have limited it to 3 hours and I think that's enough. She seems okay with it, my wife is still a little reluctant on it , I think she has more than enough time during the day for those 3 hours.

And I have allowed her access to online websites but told her if she does this again 1 hour ban is back. So yeah I guess I'm the asshole, I get that.",1
"I (32F) was on the bus with my 5-year-old daughter when we got on at a busy stop. There were no empty seats available, except for one near a person using a wheelchair (40M). I asked the person if they could move their wheelchair to another spot so that my daughter and I could sit together, but the person declined, saying that they needed the space for their mobility device.

I was taken aback and frustrated by this response. I explained to them that my daughter was very young and needed to sit next to me for safety reasons, but they still refused to move. I ended up having to stand for the entire ride with my daughter in tow, which was uncomfortable and tiring for both of us.

When I told a friend about what happened, they said I was being insensitive and ableist. They pointed out that the person in the wheelchair had a right to the space they needed and that it was unfair of me to ask them to move.

Now, I'm questioning whether or not I was in the wrong for asking the person to move. AITA for asking a disabled person to move seats on the bus for my child?",1
"AITA for saying a joking insult to a close friend?

To preface this situation, me and let’s call her Sarah, were in a 2-ish year friendship and became really close. We met at work and discovered we had a lot in common, thus would text/occasionally hang out outside of work. We texted probably every day.  We had our differences of course, but most friendships do and that was never really an issue. She’s 40 and I’m about to be 32, she is a divorcee with kids and I’ve never been married (still dating) no kids. 

Beyond our differences, we were really tight. I looked up to her a lot, despite always being wary of getting close to female friends. I felt like I could trust her and we had a playful relationship overall. 
She would tease me for being an introvert or grouchy and I would tease her for being extroverted and sometimes an air-head. 

One day, she texted me before work to warn me that the parking police was out on patrol (employees where I work are not allowed to park on campus thus police make their morning ticket rounds). I proceeded to ask her where the police were located. She responded with “yes”
I replied “yes what?” She then replied “the police are parked” which didn’t answer my question at all. 
JOKINGLY I responded “lol girl I swear you should be blonde 🤣”. 
That must’ve struck a nerve with her because she sent me this paragraph about how I was rude for insinuating that she lacked intelligence etc…
I then immediately apologized and told her I would never say that again. She then ‘liked’ my response and has given me the cold shoulder since, occasionally we run into each other but it’s awkward and fake.  I later heard from another coworker that Sarah announced that she was “avoiding negative people in life” and even criticized this coworker group chat we are all on for being “negative”, though it’s a chat of supportive people who exchange in typical work banter. 
In my opinion, my “insult” wasn’t really that bad, even though I’m aware it’s not nice either. Hence, joke. I’ve been told that and I thought we had a playful relationship like that. I feel like there are worse things people could say and not get this response.

"Throwaway. 51f, my son is 29 and he and his fiancé ""Jen"" have a 6 week old daughter ""Lily"" (she also has a 7yo son that is not mg sons child but I still consider him my grandbaby). I used to get along really well with Jen and told everyone she was like a daughter to me. But when she got pregnant, she started acting weird toward me. Like I asked to be in the room for delivery and she said a clipped ""no"" (despite letting her 7yo sons dads mom in the room for his delivery). No big deal, its her choice. But when I went to visit in the hospital afterwards she acted really put off that I was there. I figured she was just tired and left after 20 minutes to give her space. But then it continued.

I have stopped in to see everyone about 5 times since she had the baby and every single time that I walk in, she gets really quiet. Whenever I'm holding the baby she is hovering. She keeps snapping at me over small things. Like how I'm holding the baby (had her on her belly on my arm or sideways across my knees on her belly) because ""she's crying, obviously she doesn't like that so stop"". Or snapping at me for things I say to the baby (like when she starts fussing, I said ""you won't get your own way with me, you cant play me like that"" in a baby voice, trying to calm her) and she goes ""she's 4 weeks old, how exactly is she playing you?"" Then she got livid and actually kicked me out of the house one time because she picked up the baby for making the smallest of noises and I told her the baby was going to get used to being held all the time if she kept doing that and she said ""well it's a good thing she's my child and I don't have to listen to your crying it out bullshit"". Well, I went there on Thanksgiving and apparently it was her mother's first time meeting the baby and of course the baby was all smiles and loved her grandma. But when I got the chance to hold the baby, she immediately started screaming and was promptly taken from me. I feel very slighted. I asked my son if he would bring the baby to visit me without his fiancé because I feel like his fiancés attitude toward me is the reason why the baby screams every time I hold her. I definitely think she's picking up on the hostility. I don't know why she even dislikes me now but asking her currently would be pointless. He told me he absolutely would not bring his daughter to my place without her mother because he wouldn't do that to his fiancé (who has never been away from the baby thus far). I told him they were purposely ruining my chance at a relationship with my granddaughter and he said that wasn't true and that I need to stop ""pushing"" my old fashioned beliefs, which is the first time I've heard of this. AITA for expecting him to bring my granddaughter to me without her mom so I can have a relationship with her?",1
"This happened over Christmas period, my family and my wife’s brother’s (BIL) family were staying in a holiday house, and everything was going swimmingly.

For context, I’ve had a good relationship with BIL’s family, and he has a teenage son who has become quite flamboyant and developed a ‘camp’ voice (stereotypical gay traits) - this has been noted and discussed by my wife and her other family, but wife has previously mentioned no to say anything about this to BIL. BIL’s family are Christian, but not overly conservative, and certainly not anti-gay (as far as I can tell).

I’m sure you can see where this is going, but as the adults were talking over a couple of wines, the topic of being gay came up, and I asked how we might react if our kids were gay. I then asked BIL and SIL if they thought their son might be gay given his flamboyancy, and things got awkward quick - SIL walked out, and BIL brushed the comment away.

My wife said I was inappropriate and ruined the relationship and should apologise. I apologised the next day, and in laws accepted the apology, whilst commenting that it was inappropriate to talk about such personal matters and some things were best left unsaid, but things have been a little frosty ever since.

So, AITA for asking if their son might be gay?",1
"So let me clear this up, my mother and I got into an argument about my partner, she does not support our relationship. We argued for hours and hours and hours until I realized that we were going nowhere with the argument so I went to my room and shut the door. I am a very touchy person, physical touch is definitely my favourite love language. If I like you, I will hug you, hold you and etc.. I am also a big ""mommys girl"" so anytime my mother is near me, I go up to her and will hold her hand or just touch her in any way possible. But anyway after a couple of hours my anger begins to lower down, I was still angry but I still wanted to be near my mother.I go into her room and find her laying on her bed, scrolling on her usual Facebook cooking post. Sitting down next to her, I face my back towards her and start to scroll on my phone slowly heading closer towards her until my back was touching her arm. She then places her hand on my back and starts to rub it but I back away, not letting her touch me. The process would repeat, I would go closer, my mother would start to touch me and I would back away. Then she sits up and pulls me by the wrist, sitting me up as she gives me that evil mom glare. She then starts to freak out on me, screaming and raging in my face like saliva and everything splatters in my face as she speaks,""Why are you like this? Youre so complicated sometimes! You want to touch me but I can't touch you? It doesn't make sense, even when I try to ignore you, you just keep on coming back! Tell me (my name) please tell me, do you love me or not?!"" Immediately I burst into tears and lose my cool, I could hear a deep sigh from her which made me sob even harder,"" There you go again with the tears.. You always want to cry and cry when you're in the wrong I'm sick and tired of it!"" My voice shakes, my eyes were red and my nose was gushing out mucus, ""Mom, I didn't know you felt that way, why couldn't you just explain that to me, like the mature adult you're supposed to be?!""I feel bad for the words I have shared through the whole experience but I still don't know what to do. She just kept on shouting about how I was gonna become an adult soon and I'm acting like a toddler. It made me pathetic and useless, I ran to my room and shut the door. While in my room I could hear her on a call with my step-dad, she literally said, ""Yeah I'm sick and tired of this kid, watch her come to my room and try and hold me, I should've listened to my mother when she told me not to have children."" I'm not trying to seem like the victim here but I don't know what to do, I personally think we were both in the wrong but what do yall think?",1
"I m17 have a girlfriend f17, we have been together just like 6 months soon. Idk her family that well, but I have been over there sometimes and they all seem great. Her mom had her when she was 18 and I know that she doesn’t know her real father. So I think that is what is relevant to what happened.

We were going to a party this weekend and we were at my girlfriends house, when we were leaving her mom told us to take it easy and not do anything stupid and to call her. When we got out I laughed and said to my girlfriend “Not do anything stupid like getting pregnant”. I thought it was funny because her mom like took a stupid decision and got pregnant when she was our age, but told us to not do anything stupid and to take it easy. I don’t mean like it is stupid my girlfriend was born or anything I really love her, just thought it was ironic. My girlfriend did not find this funny and asked me to explain how it even would be a funny joke and I tried to explain but she just said that it wasn’t funny.

I thought it was fine I mean she didn’t say anything more about it during the party but she has barely texted me and when I asked her why she told me that she didn’t appreciate me joking about her mom in that way. I told her I did not mean to offend her but she must admit it was ironic of her mom to say that. She left me on read so I now feel like an asshole because she did not find it funny or maybe didnt get the joke. I could try to explain the joke again but idk if it would make it better or I could just apologize better. I did not feel like it was that bad but if it was then I will apologize. But please just help me see if I was an asshole or not.",1
"Longtime lurker here. Hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner.

So my wife (29F) and I (29M) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we’ve lived in our current city. We like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. We have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it’s become a great tradition in our social circle. 

Our friend James started dating his girlfriend Sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that Sarah was vegan. I thanked James for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. He agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. Everything was fine, until now.

During our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that Sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. My wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn’t push the issue. 

However, after the meal, James took us aside privately and told us that Sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. He added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it. 

My wife feels terrible that Sarah was so upset and apologized to her and James profusely, but I don’t agree that we did anything wrong. I like Sarah very much as a person and I don’t have anything against her dietary choices, but I don’t believe it’s fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners. For the record, nobody else has any dietary restrictions. AITA?",1
"I (31 F) recommended my friend, Joan (31 F) for a job opening at my work. Our field is related to offering online security services and such. However, we both work on the training section than doing actual programming. Anyway, Joan started a few months ago and she made a good impression. She's a hard worker and a pleasant person to be around. My boss is quite happy with her.

However, I've heard some comments on how she cannot be taken seriously because she's always so ""cutesy"". I started to pay attention and I noticed that she brings her lunch in a Sanrio character bag, that she put a pink floral patterned cover to her work iPad and that almost all her work stationery is ""kawaii themed"". I wouldn't say she's flashy but she definitely stands out in a workplace where everyone takes themselves way too seriously and it's mostly male-centered.

Yesterday, while talking about the upcoming week, I mentioned to her that maybe she should tone down her ""cute style"" since people were saying she couldn't be taken seriously and they were already not considering some work opportunities for her because of this impression. Joan was sad at first, but she told me she had the right to use whatever she liked as long it wasn't offensive or inappropriate (she definitely tones down her cuteness preferences when she goes to offer training to other companies). Then she told me I was so immersed in our toxic work environment that I was not seeing how unfair this was. I know our workplace is not the best, but you have to deal with it.

She said she couldn't understand how guys were allowed to have funkos in their desks and having The Avengers notepads but if she used Sanrio everyone lost their mind. Then she told me she was thinking of resigning because she got a better offer in a ""less-toxic"" work environment. I admit I got upset (because I recommended her) and I told her she was going to have the same issues wherever she went in the tech industry.

I wonder if I was TA. I am just trying to help her but she wouldn't listen

UPDATE: ok I hear you loud and clear. After reading all the comments I started to remember how  I've stopped from expressing myself after hearing snarky remarks from what I call ""the cliqué"". They are a bunch of guys who have connections in higher places and they think they own the office. In summary, they are bullies. I guess I reacted this way because I was projecting my own frustrations on Joan. I spoke to her and we are fine now. I apologized and I'm planning to send her some Cinnamon Roll themed cupcakes to the office. F\*\*\* everyone else! BTW,  I'm looking for a new job as we speak. I'm tired of this environment.",1
My boyfriend always sings along with his music that he plays in the car. And he gets really into it like with his whole body and trying vibrato and all that jazz. It’s not terrible but it’s very annoying. Even at 1am driving home from a night out he will belt out songs and I love that he loves it but it grates on my nerves so bad. I don’t like anyones singing but he particularly bothers me and when I ask him to stop he pouts and acts like a baby which makes it worse. Am I the asshole for just wanting the actual music that is professionally done to play and not have to act like I love his performances ?,1
"So my FIL, mid-70s, is a Vietnam vet and generally a very upstanding guy. He and his family are all known for storytelling so there are always lots of stories told at gatherings. They are very proud of their shared family history. 

One of FIL's favorite stories is to tell about the unbelievable coincidences he experienced, winding up stationed in the same places as his schoolmates from home during Vietnam. He grew up in New York City and went to a high school that was a feeder school for the college he & his friends all attended together. Then they enlisted together, went to boot camp together, and many of them wound up serving in the same or similar places around the same time frames. 

Last Christmas I was listening to this set of ""crazy coincidences"" again after hearing it for about 10 years, and I admit I was a little tipsy and it was really going on for a long time so I pushed back. I said it wasn't THAT much of a coincidence for them all to originate and end up in the same places, since they all had similar training, background, and timing, and were all enlisted at the same place & time. FIL and my husband, also tipsy, both got a little loud and defensive and proceeded to explain to me again, for at least an hour, about how coincidental it all was. I think I really offended them but nobody said anything about it again. AITA?",1
"So I’m fully aware this may be beyond this sub’s paygrade but right now I’m in this phase where I just want as many opinions as possible.

Anyways, we’ve been together 7 years, married for 3. We were both childfree when we met but slowly he’s shifted over to wanting kids. Our marriage over the past year has been extremely rocky as a result since we still love each other and don’t want to live without each other.

But our marriage counselor in recent months has been pushing us to find a resolution because things can’t go on without getting worse. My husband sat me down a few weeks ago to talk about trial separation. He feels that if he misses his chance for children he’ll only resent me years later and he’d rather separate now than cause more pain for us. I’m heartbroken to say the least. 

Recently I saw a friend and she suggested something I’m afraid to bring up to my therapist or our counselor because I think they’ll call it crazy. She says I should just tell my husband I’d be willing to have a baby if he promises to take over all of the childcare, from infancy to teenager. This way we can stay together, he gets his child, and I still get to live my life as I’ve always dreamed. 

I havent asked him yet but I’ve talked to my mom and sister. They said it’s feasible but they can’t imagine this system working out in the long run, and that I’ll probably get more people judging me for being an “absentee mom.” AITA for considering this option instead of separation?",1
"My girlfriend (25F) and I (29M) live in NYC and there's a popular app where you buy leftover restaurant food. Restaurants advertise ""surprise bags"" at a reduced price in order to reduce foodwaste. The customer doesn't know what they're getting until they pick the food up, but the cost at least 3x lower than the normal menu price. (EG if an entree is usually $24, the restaurant is allowed to charge $8 at most for it.) These are hit or miss - sometimes you get exactly what you want at a greatly reduced price, but sometimes you get something that you otherwise wouldn't have picked from the menu.

I ordered a surprise bag from a barbecue place that I was picking up on the way home yesterday. I texted my girlfriend asking if she wanted one but she said no, she wasn't in the mood for barbecue. However, there was an indian restaurant right next door that also had surprise bags available on the app, so she ordered one of them. The barbecue was $12 and the indian food was $10.

When I get home I unpack the meals to see what we got. I was psyched about my bag. Since I paid $12 I knew the value had to be at least $36, but honestly the platter looked a lot more expensive. This was a hit. (Keep in mind that we live in the west village, which is the most expensive neighborhood in the most expensive city in the US, so $36 for one meal is pretty typical.) There were burnt ends, ribs, pulled pork, baked beans, potato salad, bread, onions, and pickles.

My girlfriend, however, was  less lucky. Her surprise bag only had 6 different types of soup, half of them being variations on cauliflower soup. She was disappointed to say the least. She asked if we should share my barbecue and I said no, i'm hungry, I offered to buy you some already and you said no, so I'm going to devour it.

She got mad and called me the asshole. I told her if she didn't want soup she should have ordered something specifically instead of using the surprise bag app. I then told her to just order something off a food delivery app. She said she didn't want to spend the money (another bit of context is I make a lot more money than her and pay all of our rent, I know she's running a bit of a lean financial picture right now.) I then tell her that if she doesn't want to pay for delivery, I'll walk to the bodega on our street and can buy her something there. (Another bit of context is that we live on a 4th floor walkup with no elevator and she broke her leg in a car accident a month ago, so it can be tough for her to get around.) She says she the grill is probably off there and all she wants is a hot meal. I tell her she has soup.

Anyway, she thinks I'm the asshole. But in my defense:

(1) I offered to buy her barbecue to begin with, which she declined.

(2) she picked out her own food and I grabbed it for her on my way home

(3) when she wasn't satisfied, I suggested two solutions (either ordering something from an app or going to a bodega)

So, Reddit, AITA?",1
"My 23F roommate Rose 24F meal preps for her entire week of lunches and dinners. She always waits till late Sunday night to do all the cooking so often she'll leave the containers to cool on the counter overnight, because it is too hot to put in the fridge right away before she goes to bed. Two months ago I moved my two cats into the apartment, now in my household I don't allow them on the counters but if there is food left open they will try to get into it. I explained that she should be aware that the cats might try to eat her food or might knock it over if she leaves it out all night, but she brushed me off saying it was fine. I told her that it was only a matter of time before it happened. 

Well, it finally happened, I woke Monday morning to the kitchen in a mess because the cats had knocked over several containers onto the floor. I cleaned up and put the rest of the food that still looked fine into the fridge. Overall out of 7 lunches and 7 dinners, about half was ruined. When Rose got up I explained what happened and apologized. She flipped out on me, because she can't afford to buy more food for the week. Rose demanded that I buy more food because it was my animals that caused this, but I also can't afford to buy her more meals out of my own food budget. I told her I wouldn't be replacing anything because she was being irresponsible with her own food by leaving it out and I had already warned her that this might happen. She's still furious with me and some of my friends have said that I'm obligated to replace her food since it was my cats that did the damage.",1
"I (20F) have a brother (“C” 22M). For a little backstory, C and I grew up together with our grandparents. He got in trouble with the police once or twice. He also hasn’t gone to college, can never hold down a job, and is not financially independent. He also has Type 1 Diabetes and has a history of being noncompliant with it (approx. 3 hospitalizations a year). C has a habit of playing the victim in situations and will immediately throw a tantrum if he doesn’t get his way. He has caused a lot of drama within our family over time but because of the character limit, I cant get into details. In 2018, he decided to move in with our mom 2 hours away without telling anybody. When he left, there was a fight between my grandparents and my brother, mom, and her husband. C ended up shoving our grandma and things have been tense since. (I haven’t seen C since my high school graduation in 2021). I now go to college in a town around 4.5 hours away, so I visit home at least once every two months depending on my schedule. 

In January 2024, C decided to move back to our hometown and (from the kindness in their hearts) my grandparents allowed him to live with them. He constantly smokes weed in their house without them knowing, as well as it being illegal in our state. He has always had a rocky relationship with our grandparents and they told him that if he messed up again, they would kick him out no questions asked. Fast forward to February 15, C calls me and tells me his girlfriend (18F) is pregnant. They have only been together since he moved back (Jan 21) Because we’ve never had a good relationship, I tried to be supportive but told him to expect backlash from our family. C then asked me to keep it a secret. After we got off the phone, I called my sister, E 27F, to explain the situation and think about next steps. The reason I did this is due to the fact that we are very close and she is much older than me and knows how to better deal with it. We decided to keep it to ourselves for the time being to at least give C some time to get his stuff figured out. Since then, my sister and I have discussed our doubts bout the baby even being his (she has a bump at supposedly 1.5 months) but C doesn’t respond when I ask about a paternity test. 

I’m heading home this weekend, and I don’t know if I can keep it a secret from my grandparents any longer. I texted C to talk to him about it and he said it’s not my place. While I do understand that it’s his need to share, this is very likely to cause a major rift in our family and I don’t want to keep lying to my grandparents. When I told him this, he called me an effing B word and said he would disown me as a sister. It doesn’t bother me that much that he would disown me, but I do kind of feel bad since he trusted me with this news. 

My grandparents had to deal with the same thing when my mother got pregnant at 18, and got stuck raising two of her kids. I don’t want them to have to do it again. 

It’s important to note that he was happy telling me and wants to keep the baby.

"Hi all.  Throwaway account here.

Today, my wife came into my gaming room at our house and told me she was going to the store to make a return.  The store is only about 10 minutes from our house.  After about an hour I called her to see where she was, only to find out that she was hanging out with her friend.

When she got home (about 5 hours after she initially left the house) I told her that I was angry that she had lied to me about what she was going to do.  Her position is that she didn't lie to me because regardless of whether or not she told me that she was  going to hang out with her friend, she still went to the store to return the item that she was planning to return.  My position is that she lied because she (admittedly-) had already made plans to hang out with her friend but completely left that out when she told me she was going to the store to return the item.

We just had a big argument about the situation, with my wife saying she didn't realize she needed to tell me every single detail about everything she was going to do for the day.  I didn't want the details about every single little thing she was going to do, I feel like she should have just told me she was going to hang out with her friend instead of conveniently leaving that part out.

"I organized a family vacation with my ex-wife, our three kids, my wife, our two kids and my ex's husband and their son.

So 4 adults, and six kids (all boys BTW) from age 5 to 16 (5, 7, 7, 9, 14 and 16).

We arrives on Wednesday and are staying at a house by the beach. The four adults decided to go to dinner together and the number one rule was NO beach. Pool, video games, etc yes. NO beach. I said if they did then they're done.

We went out to dinner and I see two of my kids at the beach. The worst part was that one was my eldest (Chris) who was supposed to be watching the other kids. The other one was my 9 year old.

I was livid. I told my ex that I was sending them back home. She asked me what I was talking about. I said they're done with being on vacation. I'm going to put them on a plane and her parents can pick them up and we'll see them on Monday when we fly back. 

She told me that was crazy. My 9 and 16 are begging me to let them stay. I'm just waiting to see if I can find another flight.

"My younger daughter (Hayleigh, 28f) is marrying my older daughter (Jennifer, 30f)'s ex-fiancé (Sam).

Jennifer is mad at me b/c I'm going to Hayleigh's wedding. She says that, ""I'm condoning her bad sister's behavior as always"", but that's simply not true.

When the wedding was called off & we found that it was b/c Sam & Hayleigh were dating, I called Hayleigh immediately & I asked her to rethink the relationship. Not only for her sister's sake, but also because ""if he could do it once, he could do it twice"" & I didn't want her to get hurt. She reassured me that, that wasn't the case - that they were meant for each other & had known this for a long time, so I left it at that. 

I spoke to Sam, too. He apologized for any hurt he may caused, but said that it wouldn't be fair to marry Jennifer when deep in his heart he knew that he was in love with Hayleigh. They've officially been together for a little over a year now & they truly seem happy and in love. 

My husband is supporting Jennifer. He's disgusted with the whole situation & doesn't want anything to do with it. At one point he announced that he wouldn't be giving Sam his blessing or walking Hayleigh down the aisle.

I don't like the situation anymore than my husband or Jennifer do, but they don't understand that ignoring the reality of it doesn't make it go away. 

When he had said that he wasn't walking Hayleigh down the aisle, she was devastated. I asked my husband if he was willing to risk his relationship with Hayleigh by not walking her down the aisle. Jennifer accused me of trying to twist him to my side.

I told Jennifer that it's not about sides, it's about learning how to forgive. I've told her that it's been over a year now since her & Sam broke up, and she's been bitterly jumping from relationship to relationship because she's so focused on Hayleigh and Sam, and that if she never learns to forgive them, she'll never be at peace. 

She says that I don't understand that Hayleigh *purposely* stole Sam from her, & that she's been doing this since they were kids and I never noticed. I told her that she should have told me then. She said that I should've been paying closer attention & noticed it. I told her that she had to learn to let go of certain things in the past in order to move forward & that if Hayleigh did steal Sam, as she claimed, then Hayleigh did her a favor.

She didn't want to hear that, but it needed to be said. I also offered to put her on a three-way call with Hayleigh, but she declined. Then she gave me an ultimatum. She said if I go to the wedding it means Hayleigh was my favorite child all along and that she'll never speak to me again. 

I told her that I'm going to the wedding, just as I would've gone to hers if she was in that situation. She said okay & hung up. Later, my husband calls me from work telling me she called him crying.

**Edit**: 

I wanted to answer some questions here:

**Q**: Were Sam and Hayleigh having an affair, or did they start to date after the wedding was called off?

**A**: I'm not really sure. I never asked for details, and I'm not sure I really want to know either. From what I've been told, Sam came to Jennifer and told her that he couldn't marry her because he was in love with Hayleigh. 

**Q**: When I spoke to Hayleigh, why didn't I tell her she was wrong?

**A**: Because if she doesn't feel like she's wrong at the age of 28, then nothing I say will convince her otherwise. We've all known what's it like to be in love with someone that people we care about don't like. And how did that turn out? Despite warnings, we had to see it through to the end and suffer the consequences. Because I loved her, I still warned her, but it's up to her to make the decision for herself now.

**Q**: Why am I supporting Sam and Hayleigh's relationship despite the hurt it causes Jennifer?

**A**: I'm not supporting the relationship, I'm supporting Hayleigh. Not because of what she did, but because of who she is. That's my daughter, and no matter how much I disagree with her or Jennifer's actions, I carried them both of them inside me and my love for both of them is unconditional. I've supported and comforted Jennifer to the best of my ability, and I will be here to do so until the day I die, but that goes for Hayleigh, as well.",1
"I’ve been friends with K since about the 8th grade. I’m currently 33 and she’s 34. K is a little quirky and hasn’t kept many friends over the years (other than me).

In 2018, she got engaged to her long-time boyfriend. Within a week, she asked me to be her maid of honor (I accepted). We would send each other “Inspo” photos and I agreed to help with her dreams for her wedding. I was with her when she picked her dress.

Long story short, engagement #1 didn’t make it. A few vendors were booked, but they didn’t get to the point of a bridal shower or anything like that. I stuck by her, again, and supported the decision.

Fast forward to Feb 2023, she’s engaged. I met her fiancé for the first time in July. I heard plenty about him prior, we just never met.  The day I met the fiancé, K told me they were adding another bridesmaid to the mix, M. M knows both K and her fiancé for about a year and M feels like a younger sibling to K. Cool, no problem, added to the list.

In August I was browsing ideas for a bachelorette party. I texted my friend to verify the attendees (her cousins, + M), and then received “oh I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that.” She proceeded to tell me that she “didn’t want me to feel less valued,” so she asked if M and I would share the position. The message sounded like she had told me prior that M would be the MOH, but she hadn’t. I scrolled through texts to see if I had missed something, but I didn’t. Then she told me that because I’m married and I have a toddler, she figured being maid of honor would be too overwhelming, so she didn’t ask me. I was upset. I told her I would prefer to be a guest. I was hurt that she never had the decency to tell me about the changes made. I never talked to M - I never even knew she existed prior to July. Suddenly I was expected to share a title with someone she’s known a year, and apparently I was the last to know about this title swap.

Am I wrong that I thought I was the MOH since I WAS (definitively) in round 1? Shouldn’t there have been a conversation to ask me if I thought I could handle it? Am I overreacting? I was literally ready to put a deposit on the bachelorette festivities! I have the pictures of the bridesmaids and their dresses on my phone with their measurements and their contact numbers. I have pictures of the bride and her outfit and hair and makeup on my phone.  Did I ASSume? Or would you have done the same?

I was hurt (and I still am). After our misunderstanding, we didn’t speak. She reached out in October asking to meet up - I dodged her. She texted a “Merry Christmas” and I replied with similar civility. She said “I miss you. I’m so sorry.” I couldn’t respond, and still haven’t.

Today I just received an invite for her bridal shower. Up to this point, I anticipated sending a gift (whether I was invited or not) as hope for of best wishes and closure… but I did not expect to receive an invite. I don’t want to attend at all.

AITA?",1
"When my ex-husband and I divorced three years ago, my daughter took it fairly well. She (unfortunately) understood why, so it wasn't a shock, but of course it was still a major change. Our main focus was on doing what was best for her, so we tried to involve her as much as was healthy in what the new schedule would be. We settled on a flexible 50/50 and she took it in stride. The only thing she asked was to never have any new parents or siblings. I thought it was a weird thing to ask for as neither of us were even considering dating, but she was worried to the point of hysterics about it, so we agreed. 

A year and a half ago, my now-husband. My daughter met him and they got along fine, she met his kids and that was fine, and she's met probably too many of her father's female guests, so I thought she'd gotten over it. I was wrong. Late last year, we got engaged and started preparing to move in together, and she lost it. She went into hysterics that I was breaking my promise. She announced that she would not be spending the night with me anymore, and demanded to live with her father 100% of the time. I told her that was ridiculous and that the schedule was not changing.

Her father decided to back her, and is willing to fight it in court ""if necessary"". My lawyer says if it goes to court, it could go either way because she's over 12 years old, which is a last resort for us. 

I don't want this change. Her father loves her, but he's not really a responsible parent. He leaves her home alone far too much, and doesn't even try to supervise or put limits on anything. More so, my daughter is a child, and she shouldn't have the right to dictate how much she sees her parents.

I know I stupidly agreed to not remarry in that moment, but that wasn't a realistic thing to promise and she has to know that. My ex is on her side and thinks she should live where she's most comfortable, and agrees with her that I'm ""being irresponsible"". I don't think it's healthy to give her that much power, especially over something that was demanded when she was all of nine years old.",1
"I 23F have small boobs. You can’t tell if I’m wearing a bra or not in most tops so when I can, I don’t wear a bra as I find them uncomfortable.

My friend Kate 25F is getting married and asked me to be a bridesmaid. I accepted and then she texted me privately to ask if I could wear a bra for her wedding as she doesn’t want me to  flash someone. 

I tried explaining to her that, the bridesmaid dress she had picked out had full sleeves so you wouldn’t be able to tell as the material is also very thick. 

Kate got really mad at me and my sister said maybe I should just suck it up and wear a bra. 

I just find it to be a weird invasive question as you literally can’t tell if I had a bra on in the first place or not in that dress, and I’m sure no one over there is staring at my chest.",1
"I am a college student and my sister in in High school, she is sixteen and I am nineteen. We are close and she often does ask me for advice. 

She asked me for some advice two days ago,  she looked very sullen, sad and pretty withdrawn so I was ready for something important and serious and she told me that her best friend had come out as bisexual to her and her family. 

I asked her if her friend was alright and she told me that she was doing well and her family had accepted her but she was feeling fucked up about it and had kinda avoided her friend for a week.

Honestly, I kinda lost my patience with her and told her that her friend coming out was not something she should be depressed about and she was being very weird about it and should just talk to her. I have friends who have been ghosted by their friends after coming out and it seems to be something that still hurts them. I told her that she get over herself and talk to her and not to be one of those people who thought coming out meant she had a crush on her or something like that. 

She did seem take it well for some time but she has been avoiding me ever since and blocked me on all social media which is pretty odd from her tbf. She has never done this before so I am wondering I did something stupid here. 

I feel like I dismissed her feelings because I thought it would be about something far more serious but her feelings are serious and I should have been less judgmental and snappy about it.",1
"I 22F used my boyfriend's car with permission while he is away traveling and accidentally scraped the side of it on a low wall.

I am a student and need a car sometimes and I'm grateful he lets me use his.

I took it to a shop which would do a good job and got a quote, and my mom is willing to lend me some money to fix it. I could get the car fixed before my boyfriend comes back.

I am considering not telling him about the incident as a couple of months ago I backed into a bollard and he was very angry with me about it even though I paid to fix it.

I am scared he will react badly and not be understanding like last time. I am careful and I'm not a bad driver and this isn't something that happens often.

The car is a couple of years old and it is not an expensive one.

WIBTA if I never told him and he never asked?",1
"My gf is in the food business. She works 8-12 hours a day running her own small business. Due to her job, she does a lot of cleaning and dishes. She takes Mondays off to recover and usually spends most of the day on the couch watching television. 

Most nights, I cook dinner and prepare our lunches/breakfasts. 

Yesterday (Monday), I got home from work and she said she just finished a peloton ride and then sat on the couch. I asked her if she’d mind helping me make a salad or prepare some vegetables for dinner. 

She said she was tired so I just dropped it. We’ve argued about these things in the past and I didn’t want to argue after my day. I put in some headphones and got to work. 

The entire time, it ate away at me that she was okay not contributing to any of our meals. From my perspective, she was leaving me on an island to do this for us. The rest of the night was frigid between us.

We had a chance to talk this morning and I expressed to her that it feels like she’s leaving me on and island when she turns down my requests for help. She stated that she wouldn’t be made to feel bad because she’s just tired. 

To me, it’s not about the salad. It’s about a willingness to be there with me after a long day and preparing something together. I sacrifice at least 1 weekend day to help her (this week it was 1.5 days) to help her sell her products. It just doesn’t seem fair that I’m an asshole if I don’t help her with her stuff but she won’t meet me halfway about cooking dinner. 

AITA?",1
"Throwaway because too many of my friends know my main account.

My fiance has a brother who's seven years younger than him. LB has started going to therapy fairly recently, mostly for PTSD from his military service but he also talks about his family.

A couple weeks ago, LB sent my fiance pictures from his vacation in Hawaii with his girlfriend of about six years.My fiance's rsponse was something like ""Looks like a great honeymoon. Did you tell mom and dad yet?"" He also sent the ""All the Single Ladies"" video.

So after they had come home, LB texted my fiance that he'd shown those messages to his therapist and she agreed with him that he's toxic because of always telling him what to do and turning everything into a joke, so it was best if they not talk.

Since I also like joking about serious things, I suggested that my fiance send LB the video of Britney Spears' ""Toxic"". He also thought it was funny, so he did it.

Now LB has him blocked on basically everything, their mom called to yell at him, and I feel like it's my fault even though my fiance doesn't blame me in the slightest.

"Was at lunch with sister (33F) and our mutual friends. Asked friend (“J”) if she wanted extra ticket to attend last minute sporting event with me that same night.

"Ok so after I (28M) got kicked out of my apartment I needed a new place to stay. My sister (24F) is living at her friends house and says they are cool with me crashing for the summer. I only need about three months anyways. When I show up the place is a MESS and even worse the room I was suppose to take is a dump ground for my sisters stuff. The kitchen is cluttered and disgusting. The bathroom is cluttered, moldy, and stinky. I decided to stay anyways because hey free rent. Over the course of the past month I have been cleaning and decluttering everywhere I could. I cant believe her friend puts up with her actually I can she is also responsible for the mess. I have thrown away countless cups, plates, canned food, candy, pasta, coffee, tea, hair accessories, cheap rings, sandals, Tupperware, trash, clothes, hats, countless socks etc. I know it sounds like this stuff could have been donated but all of her clutter comes from cheap dollar stores. They both love having me as a roommate because they think I am handy. I am. 

Slowly my sister has been noticing her stuff missing. She has questioned me and even called me asking if I have seen her shoes or whatever. I just deny seeing it and say I only throw away expired food, duplicates, or broken stuff. I am able to get away with throwing stuff out because I only do it on trash day. lol. Yesterday I messed up though because I forgot it wasn't trash day. I had filled the trashcan with a bunch of my sisters clothes and I was to lazy to take the trash out. She rarely uses the kitchen trashcan anyways since she doesn't clean up after herself. I was wrong and she noticed. I came home to an emptied out kitchen trashcan in the middle of the kitchen and she demanded I explain my self. I simply said that I had a ""trash box"" and a ""good box"" and that I emptied out the wrong box while I was decluttering the laundry room. She didn't buy it. I am doing her a favor and her friend a favor but they just don't see it. 

AITA?

Edit: Okay people I am the asshole. After reading many comments and arguing with yall I see it now. I still need time to think about what to do next but I for sure need to apologize and offer to replace everything.

What I have learned:
-I was essentially stealing
-They didn't ask for my help
-My actions make hoarding worse (not sure if its full on hoarding but i am not helping)
-They are doing me a massive favor not the other way around
-I am a guest

Detail I left out: 
-I have no job.
-I got kicked out of last apartment because landlord wanted her daughter to move in closer to her
-I am sleeping on the couch because thats the only space available for the moment",1
"I (29M) have one flaw that my girlfriend (29F) really hates. She rear ended someone the other day and I was in the car and couldn't stop laughing. She got mad and said I probably saw it coming and intentionally did not warn her and that it was embarrassing for me to be laughing in front of the other driver.

I have always had this issue and the same thing has happened before when she had a different minor accident, when we were in college and she failed a course etc. I do not do it on purpose and it only happens in the moment, afterwards I do comfort her and sometimes feel bad for her. If I think back about past events though sometimes it does make me laugh.

This happens with other girls as well sometimes with my friends and when I see women struggle to park or something.

I have a harmless addiction of also watching videos online of girls failing at things, crashing their cars etc.

I do not believe any misogynistic things or think that women are dumb or anything at all. It's just something I cannot control in the moment and that I wish I could.

AITA here given that it is something I can't control?",1
"I’m (f15) learning how to drive in my sisters (19) car. My sister and I have very different standards of cleanliness. Her room is always messy, she has no problem rewearing clothes, she sleeps with our dog, she doesn’t wash her face, and she only washes her hair like once or twice a week. 

I knew she eats in her car because her booster seat thing had sesame seeds in the holes and I sometimes see fast food wrappers in the car but I can just take off the booster thing and ignore it. 

I got home the other day and she was eating in her car and there was food everywhere. It was disgusting. When she came inside, I told her to stop eating in her car because it grosses me out. She said it’s not my car so not my choice but I told her I drive it almost every day. 

She told me she has 25 minutes to eat and get to work after class and her work is 15 minutes away from her school so she’s gonna eat wherever she wants and if I have a problem with that I can buy my own car. I told her I can’t work if I can’t drive and she said that’s not her problem. 

She hasn’t been letting me drive her car because “apparently it’s disgusting” and she’s been kinda bitchy to me so I wanted to know if I was the asshole for telling her not to eat in her car",1
"In my school we’re all pretty close to each other. So pretty much everyone knows everyone and we all look out for each other. No one sits alone or anything like that. But there’s this girl in our class (17F) who is very secluded in a way. Like she only talks a lot to 3 people and with everyone else she is just much more quiet and even sits alone if they’re absent.

The thing is we all have asked her many times about it because we think she is socially anxious or autistic or something so we want to be nice and we are already understanding so we want to help. But she denied that she is and just said once that she is not good with crowds.

Today some younger guys called for her at lunch and she sat with them (both of her other friends were absent and one was sitting with us). It rubbed us all the wrong way, like why is she so nice to them but so cold with us when we did nothing wrong. I talked to her after class ended and asked her why she is so distant and I was honest with her about us finding her rude. I told her if she clarified to me why she is acting this way I can help. 

I also told her I know that no one prefers to be alone so I just don’t understand.  She looked mad and told me that if I think really hard I would get it. I’m just upset about her reaction and I guess I could be an AH for not beinh gentle. So AITA?",1
"(I am using a throwaway for this specific post only)

I (18M) am a long time friend of girl in my school named Hannah (18F)

All throughout high school Hannah has mentioned many times before to me that she's not physically attracted to men and finds certain intimate things completely gross, she had a boyfriend briefly last year and much as she liked him romantically the reason they split was because she avoided any sort of physical contact with him, I had already taken this as a clue that she might not be straight.

anyways there is a new girl in our school and she is pretty nice, so I was chatting with Hannah later in the day via snapchat and she kept talking about how she found the new girl very attractive. and made very specific comments about the new girl that I found pretty interesting, this isn't the first time either as she has made specific comments about many of our other girl classmates to me over time, at that point I made a comment that I think she is a lesbian in denial and cited all the reasons I listed above. She got  upset and started going of about how much she hates the lgb community as a whole (keep in mind that she does that pretty often) then she got angry and ghosted me, keep she isn't acting like this because she is shy or anything, she is genuinely in complete denial about this.

In my mind, it was like pointing out something obvious that she might not have realized about herself. I also thought that it was a joke that we could all laugh about, because we're good friends and we always tease each other, I didn't realize this would set her off lie this.",1
"If my husband is busy at work, he’s pretty much unreachable unless you call his assistant who will only put you through to him if it’s a serious emergency that needs his immediate attention. It’s only since we found out I’m pregnant that he’s made it so that I can call him directly and he answers no matter how busy he is.

A few days ago, my brother-in-law came over because he wanted to speak to my husband. I told him my husband was still in Germany but he should try calling him since he said it was important and couldn’t wait. He told me he had already tried calling but hadn’t been able to speak to his brother. 

He asked me to call my husband for him since he knows my husband would take my call. I told him I didn’t think it was a good idea because he was in meetings all day and he would think something bad happened to the baby if I called him. My brother-in-law kept pressuring me to call and made it seem like it was this huge emergency that couldn’t wait so I called my husband for him.

My husband is now angry at both of us but mostly at me. He said he told me when he set this up that I was only supposed to call him in an emergency and that I had abused it by calling him for his brother. We interrupted his meeting and I think that’s contributing to how frustrated he is. He told me if I did it again, things would have to go back to the old way because I couldn’t keep interrupting him when he’s working.

After 4 hours,  I decided to call the phone repair shop because they hadn't given me any updates and was taking longer than expected.  When I called, they refused to give my phone back until the next day.  Thinking that it was more serious than I thought, I waited until the next day. 

The next day, I went to the repair shop and asked for my phone. They refused to give it back, and that was when I lashed out. I screamed at them to give it back, and the worker tried to explain that he couldn't fix it. He ended up handing me my phone, and when I turned it on, the damage was worse. The screen didn't turn on at all and had cracks and scratches all over the place. The camera was also scratched up and everytime I open my phone, it wont open all the way (I have a Galaxy Flip 4) I screamed even more at the worker, and he didn't even apologize.

"Before I let the good people of Reddit give their two cents, I want to let you all know: this is a petty disagreement. Barely enough to be considered an argument, if even. Regardless of the results, neither of us are going to “run for the hills” or anything dramatic. 

We have a convenience store that’s a 5 minute walk from my partner and I’s house that is great for snacks. We decided to take the dog with us for this quick trip since it was time for her to go out anyway, but had to leave her tied up outside once we got there. Note: it was approx 50° with a slight breeze. 

We went our separate ways inside the store to get what we wanted (more efficient that way). I was browsing for all of 5 minutes and was finishing up when I saw him in line. I figured he would just wait for me at the register, but when I was ready about 1 minute later (*literally* less than 60 seconds later) he was already handing the cashier his card. I was a bit annoyed because we came in together and we usually pay together. By the time I reached the till he was practically out the door. I had to get his attention to let him know I still had to pay for my stuff when he tried to hand me his card, but I declined. It was my turn to pay for stuff (I would have paid for his stuff if he had waited), so it wasn’t about the money. 

When I asked him why he didn’t wait he replied with “I wasn’t thinking about it, I wanted to get to the dog so she wouldn’t be alone”. That’s fine- I’ve felt the same way in the past if she’s been waiting a while, but when I do, (and if I think partner is going to take a while) I find my partner and let him know my stuff is at the register, I’ll be waiting outside (and hand him my card if it’s my turn to pay). I told him I thought it was a little rude that he didn’t wait, asked him why he couldn’t just communicate with me, and that it kind of felt like he forgot that I even came with him. He got annoyed that I was annoyed and about the whole situation so now we’re both just irritated. So, AITA? ",1
"I know the title may seem confusing, but trust me, it will all make sense later on in the story. So I (17M) am a senior in high school and am currently interning as a student aid for my cooking teacher that I had last year. Today, the class got to make cinnamon rolls from scratch, and due to me being the student aide and having quite a lot of my friends that I have known since middle school in that class, my teacher usually allows me to help them out. So, for this group I was in today, I was with my one friend (let's call him James), and 2 other people (due to 1 being a male and the other being a female, I'll refer to the male as Kyle and to the female as Sarah). Now, Sarah had been suspended for the prior 2 weeks due to her getting in a fight with somebody at school, so she did not participate in helping us bake the cinnamon rolls as she was completing makeup work. Kyle, on the other hand, made some contribution when it came to making the dough; however, he didn't wash any of the dishes like James and I did before preparing to make the dough and filling, or even help with cleaning up. So, when the lunch bell rings, James and I stay behind to wait for the cinnamon rolls to be done while Sarah and Kyle leave for lunch. They come back after lunch to the cinnamon rolls not being done. Soon, the bell rings and Kyle says that James and I should package his cinnamon rolls for him and Sarah, and that I should meet with them after dismissal, due to the cinnamon rolls not being fully done yet and needing about 15 minutes left to cook in the oven. Keep in mind, our sink is filled with dirty dishes that we had to clean, and Kyle just left James and I to do the work for him, and every time we've had a class period where we cooked food, he basically would only help a little bit with the cooking, but not wash the dishes and just leave the mess for James and I to clean up. So after 15 minutes pass, and the cinnamon rolls are finished, James and I begin to split the cinnamon rolls we had into portions to see how much we'll be giving to each group member. However, James and I were thinking that due to Sarah not even being a part of our group today, and Kyle not even bothering to help us wash the dishes, clean up the sink and the table, or even put the stuff away, we simply wouldn't worry too much about being able to give the cinnamon rolls to them. However, we decided to be generous and give them 3 each. Now, after my fourth period, I had to go to my after-school program (which I have every day) and I tried to find Kyle and Sarah, but couldn't. Eventually, I thought that I shouldn't really give them this as they didn't necessarily deserve it. So, I instead gave Kyle and Sarah's cinnamon rolls to my friends. I kind of feel like a jerk for doing that as I could have simply kept them, brought them home, and found Kyle and Sarah tomorrow at school to give it to them, but at the same time, they never really contribute whenever we have these days where we cook, especially Sarah. So, AITA for doing this?",1
"I'll be blunt and short. I'm a schizophrenic. It sucks. Now, I just found this out about a year or two ago after moving out. I've had symptoms all my stupid life since childhood, but the cause was always ""you watch to many scary movies"" or something along these lines. My mom thought for whatever fucked up reason I was some sort of psychic or something. My hallucinations were ghosts or some shit. 


First thing I did when I moved out was go get tested. Surprise surprise, this isn't normal. I grew up thinking this was normal, alas it is not. I've been thinking I'm sort of messed up indigo child or something else like my family said, no, no, no it's schizophrenia.

Here's the thing, my family has had a recent baby boom. My sisters both had babies and my brother has just had a little boy with his baby mama. I guess they did genetic testing which led to the discussion of genetics. Then the jokes started ""Well I just hope they don't turn out like their aunt"" my mom joked. I spouted off that what I do have, you probably fucking gave me. I refused to elaborate and now I'm getting texts about how my family needs to know so they can test their children to make sure they're healthy because they're assuming it's something really messed up because I won't tell them. 

I feel like it's my business alone. Besides, I don't think you can test for it while they're babies. They're making me feel like an asshole because if I don't tell them they're gonna have to do all these expensive test. Well my logic is if someone had at least googled my symptoms they'd have a vague answer and I'd have been treated ages ago.

Edit: I've decided to tell them, but only on the condition they keep their mouths shut to our parents.  If they don't agree to that, then they're on their own. I feel like this is a reasonable boundary, but I will tell them when the babies get older either way. It's not fair to the little ones.",1

When she moved in with me, she didn't initially help towards the mortgage, I didn't ask her either, business was good and money was flowing so I didn't care. She did split all other costs. She isn't an evil person, has a good heart and cares for me. All other aspects of our relationship is either good or normal. Any subject revolving around money has a high tendency of triggering arguments. She does have a job, makes her own money, high-end 5 figure.

After (1-2 years after) some talks she decides to help me out with half of the mortgage. But, she had mentioned its not fair for her to give me rent money because I will put it towards the mortgage and build equity and she gets nothing in return. I thought this was semi fair / unfair statement, but given you are with some one you care and plan to start a family with.. why not come up with something that benefits her as well.

I decided to give her back the principal amounts she has paid in the event house is sold. A contract was written in 2020, but never signed, she didn't follow up, I didn't, life moved on.

As 1-1.5 years ago, her income and savings took a hit, she wasn't able to continue helping with her share that would goes towards the mortgage and ultimately the principal of it be available to her incase the house was sold.

Not much I could do, I carried on paying the full share, but still honoring (verbally) the contract for the payments made to me, I still am as of writing this.

Recently she mentioned that she is having a lawyer look a the contract (We're in 2024 now), and I had to pause and mention the following:

I don't think its fair for me to continue the contract since I am owed money and since 1-1.5 years ago I have only received 2-3 payments, so around 8-11 possibly pending. I have no benefit here, I am giving you principal back on amount paid if house is sold but I am not getting consistent money and cash flow from you. For me to honor a contract on irregular payments made to me going forward makes no sense.

"I (29M) recently went to my friend’s (28M) birthday party. For the sake of simplicity, I’ll call him Luke. I met Luke in college and we have been fairly close friends ever since. I wouldn’t say he’s my closest friend, but we’re close enough to where he invited me to his birthday party. 

He knows a decent bit about my history, but i really don’t like to talk about my past that much. I won’t get into the details but i do suffer from PTSD and used to cope with drugs. To put the entire story into a super oversimplified sentence: my dad is a dick and I used to have a coke problem. However, I can say that I am now completely sober and have been for a year. Luke doesn’t know all the details of my past, but he does know that i used to be an addict. 

I hadn’t had any close calls for a while until last night when i went to Luke’s birthday party. I was told it would be a “small hangout” but when arrived, it was a *party.* probably 30-40 people at the peak, loud music, and enough alcohol to feed a village. Luke was always the type of guy who liked parties, so this wasn’t a huge shock. Everything was fine for the first part of the night, That was until i saw out of the corner of my eye, some people, including Luke, sitting around a table doing lines. The whole party was starting to gravitate in that direction, and i could tell that this was about to become the sole focus of the rest of the night. 

Now i want to clarify, i have no issue if those people want to partake in that. Do whatever you want, it’s your funeral. What i did have a problem with, was my “friend”, inviting me to his party knowing damn well that there was going to be drugs and that I was a recovering addict. I had managed to stay clean for so long, and it was literally a few feet away from me. This was my worst nightmare. 

I blew up at him, I pulled him to the side and screamed at how stupid he was and how shitty it was of him to do this to his supposed “friend.” My screaming drew the attention of a lot of the crowd and Luke looked horribly embarrassed, but i stormed out before he could respond to me. 

I went home, and went to bed, but when I woke up i had a catalogue of texts from Luke saying how he didn’t think it would have mattered to me because i had been sober for so long, and that regardless it was out of line for me to explode like that because it “ruined his birthday.” He keeps saying that if i didn’t like it, i “should have just left and not made my addiction everyone else’s problem.” 

to me, it felt like a huge violation of trust. I had confided in him that i had drug problems and he failed to consider me or even warn me beforehand that this would be happening at his party. I haven’t responded to anything he has said yet but I am still absolutely pissed at him.  

so, AITA for yelling at my friend at his birthday party?


Edit: someone advised me to add this- Luke is the one who brought the coke. I saw him pull it out of his own backpack and pass it around the table.


Edit 2: Hey, just wanted to say thanks for all the verdicts and opinions. Unfortunately, in light of the events discussed in this post and all the discussion happening in this thread I’ve had some dangerous thoughts resurfacing so i am going to log off for a bit for my own safety. I am planning to reach out to Luke in the coming days to try and clear the air but i do not intend to continue to remain being around him. Once again, thanks for all the replies, see you later.",1
"So the wedding is coming up soon and I really do not want to go. My anxiety is playing up and ever since they (BIL and fiance) announced the wedding date (Valentines Day) it's just making me feel worse. It's the only day of the year that my mom will babysit for us to go out for a fancy meal and relax in a posh hotel spa. I genuinely look forward to it but this year Husband will just get blackout drunk and I'll end up being designated driver for his family all evening (happened at other BILs wedding).

This pregnancy is making me feel a little nauseous sometimes but I'm not throwing up or anything. If it was anyone else's wedding I would just tell them I was busy but because it's my husband's brother and he's the bestman and our daughter is a flower girl it's not like I can politely refuse.

So WIBTA if I woke up and pretended to throw up all morning just to sit at home and binge Netflix on my own? Atleast I'd get a break from the kids for a few hours and husband wouldn't get so drunk and I wouldn't be a free taxi",1
"
My (M17) older brother (M26) passed away 3 weeks ago in an auto accident. It was devastating for the entire family though he was low contact with them for minor disagreements. His girlfriend was the one devastated the most, She didn't eat or take a shower for an entire week. My parents took her in last week because she could no longer afford rent for the apartment she shared with my brother.

Here's the situation, before my brother passed away, I think this took place a month ago. He confined in me his problems with his girlfriend and said he was planning on breaking up with her next month (Jan) I thought that was too much for his girlfriend since she'd always been the one to try to work things out but my brother had issues.


Seeing his girlfriend depressed to the point of losing weight and hearing her break down crying multiple times a day, I decided to sit down and tell her what my brother was planning on doing. I didn't just dish it out on her, I just told her what he told me but she reacted in a very negative way, She had a break down crying and screaming at me. My parents came rushing asking what was happenning and I told them after my brother's girlfriend rushed upstairs. My parents berated me saying I should never have said this to her seeing how breaved and struggling she was. I explained that I felt bad for her and didn't think it was fair for me to hide this important truth from her. They told me i had no right and this was not a good timing...also said that I just made it worse and tainted my brother's memory for her and confused her even more. I got punished harshly but my friends agreed I did the right thing since my brother's girlfriend's situation is just tragic and she needed this piece of info and I was right and considerate to give it to her.


I really think I just let her know this because I felt guilty for hiding the truth from her but I might be TA for what I did.",1
"I (48F) met my husband 8 years ago, and his daughters (aged 19 and 13) 6 years ago. My husband divorced their mother 13 years ago. My husband has told me the full story about the divorce, and while I won't go into detail as it's a long story, it wasn't amicable and it really drove a wedge between him and his daughters, particularly his oldest.

The other main thing that has gotten between my husband and his older daughter is that she is on the spectrum and has very little social awareness. Pretty much every time I see her either I or someone else has to get on her about time and place, as she has a tendency to talk about things that aren't appropriate.

The divorce is what she brings up the most when it happens. She seems to get a kick out of telling family members and friends stories about her father in which he is the bad guy, and while they are true stories a lot of what she tells people is exaggerated. 

I've asked her several times not to discuss her childhood or the divorce during family events, as I don't want our extended family or friends to view my husband in a negative light.

A few weeks ago, during a back-to-school party after winter break, I overheard her telling her stepfather a story about a time her dad was intoxicated. I stopped her and told that we had been over this and at this point it felt like she was doing it on purpose.

She started to make all kinds of excuses, such as her stepfather asked about it and she wasn't making it up, and I told her it didn't matter and that she shouldn't be talking about it regardless.

She walked away from me (which she tends to do during confrontation) and her mother came up to me about 10 minutes later and laid into me for yelling at her daughter. 

She told me she agreed about the lack of awareness and time and place, but that I apparently need to let her handle it because she's her mother and I barely know her. (Which is false, my husband has visitation and has the entire time I've known them).

I'm honestly not sure if I was wrong. I've talked to her about it so many times so I feel like it was at least partially warranted, but I'm curious what others think. AITA?",1
"24F So my fiancé (27M) really wants a cat, and I understand, they’re nice pets. But I grew up with a cat and he doesn’t so I don’t really think he understands how hard it can be to take care of one. He said that it’ll be so easy because they just use the bathroom in the litter box and don’t need much attention. But I know it’s not that simple. 

For background, he knows he would have to take care of it most of the time because he’s unemployed and looking for work. Meanwhile I’m constantly busy because I’m trying to get through nursing school. I’m just afraid I’ll end up having to look after the cat a lot more than he will. That’s how it was with the fish we used to have. My fiancé forgot to feed it multiple times. 

Friday night, before he went over to play poker with some friends. I found this to be the perfect opportunity to have some of my friends over (as my fiancé doesn’t like my friends). Him and I had a little argument about the cat again before he left. He insisted it would be easy and he would clean up after it and everything but I just can’t believe him after the fish. And he tries to say that cleaning up things like vomit really isn’t that bad when I know how gross it can be. 

So here’s where I might be the AH: my friends and I were drinking and watching movies and I’ll admit, we drank a little much. I was complaining a bit about my fiancé and so the argument was on my mind. Eventually I started to feel really sick and I jokingly suggested that I throw up on the floor and make my fiancé clean it to he actually sees how gross it is. My drunk friends actually encouraged me to do it so I didn’t go to the bathroom and ended up vomiting on the hardwood floor in our apartment. Nobody cleaned it up anticipating that he would clean it up to understand the struggles of having a pet. I know it sounds a little ridiculous but it was drunk logic. 

The next morning when my fiancé came home he was furious and screamed at me for doing such a nasty thing. I felt a little bad but at the end of the day that’s the sort of thing that happens when you have a pet. You come home to vomit on the floor. And again, he comes from a place of not really understanding that’s a part of having a pet like a cat. I really did want him to clean it up. He yelled at me calling me crazy And honestly, his refusal to clean up I think shows he’s not ready to take care of a pet. 

As of now he’s really not talking to me and I know this sounds weird but both of us are being so stubborn that none of us have yet cleaned the vomit as of today. He’s been out with his friends most the weekend because he’s so mad. But I really think he should step up and show he’s ready for that sort of responsibility. 

So Reddit, AITAH?

Throwaway account because it’s embarrassing 

Edit. After reading the responses, I see what I did was *probably* over the top and I should clean it. I told my fiancé I would clean up this time and apologize for making the mess and hope we can talk about the cat situation. He said that he would forgive me this time if I flashed my tits (they are D cups). I flashed him and we are moving on. ",1
"So my husband’s bday was last saturday. We also had friends (a couple) come in from across the country that friday. Initially we were planning to go to a steakhouse for his birthday and as a get together. But unfortunately, he unexpectantly had to work so he couldn’t make it. I asked our friends if they mind a last minute change to a fancy sushi place (all 3 of us love sushi, husband prefers steak, and doesn’t even like raw fish).

Anyways, it was definitely fancy. We did omakase with bunch of a la cart. The total for the 3 of us was over 1k.

 We celebrated his bday the next day at that steakhouse.

I didn’t tell him about the switch because I didn’t want him to feel left out. Later he was asking if we were ok with eating steak twice in a weekend. So i had to tell him we had sushi. Unfortunately, our friends were really excited to share about our experience (their first time to omakase). He didn’t say anything more about this but in private, he said I essentially celebrated his bday without him. I asked him what did he want me to do with friends across the country staying with us for just a weekend? Go to mcdonalds? So was I an AH for doing a “more fancy and expensive” dinner without my husband on the night of his birthday because he couldn’t join?

Edit:

I didn’t tell him bc he was called into a horrible case and his patient died and he wasn’t even on call. But also i didn’t want him to feel left out (despite it was no one’s fault). Felt guilty enjoying life while he was going through the wrenches.  He can’t even tell me exactly why he felt upset. He’s not mad.

Took them to omakase bc they never had it. Fyi, (not that it matters imo), i paid for both dinners from my personal leisure fund.",1
"Context: its been a really long day and getting home prepping my food. Im in a not so bad mood, but very very tired. We have guests over and my responses are very short, but ive exhausted my social battery all weekend. I dont hate the guests, i just usually have a resting bitch face when im dead tired. While prepping my food for the week, my wife takes notice and starts bitching at me for acting the way i am. I literally cant think of any situation, and tried to talk to her but she just thinks im the worst person and asshole and bumps me aside to get outta the convo.",1
"This is the first time I’ve had drama with my best friend since HS Trenton (both 27M). I’ve known his wife Chrissy since college and during their wedding I met Becca who was the maid of honor (28F). Really cool person, she has a 6 year old who she brings to Trenton/Chrissy’s when I’m there so I’ve gotten to know Becca well. 

Recently I broke up with my GF and I was hanging out more at Trenton’s because Chrissy is pregnant (with permission). Chrissy suggested that since I don’t have anyone to do things with right now that I should get closer to Becca because she likes to try new places too. Becca is fun, easy on the eyes and would provide great company. We made plans to check out a new brewery and I was clear that it was as friends.

We texted back and forth a few times during the week leading up. Saturday comes and 2 hours before she calls franticly saying her kid was having a meltdown because of her dads parents and was sick so she had to cancel. I told her it was all good. The next week we didn’t talk as much and Chrissy asked if I was gonna give the friendship another go. I said maybe. 

On Monday, Becca called me apologizing and asked if I wanted to check out the brewery Friday. I said absolutely. Literally 1 hour before she calls me almost in tears. Saying babysitter canceled and asked if I’d be okay waiting for another hour. She was going to take her kid to her parents who lived 30 minutes away and then would meet me. I told her I wasn’t gonna wait around another hour because the whole point of this was to have friends to do things with. I had been bailed on twice, so I was gonna go. 

She offered to have me come to her place and she’d make us a drink on the back deck and we could hangout there for the night till her kid went to bed. I said that wasn’t the kind of friendship I was wanting and it just felt like our schedules were not aligning. I wanted a friend who I could do things with consistently. My time is valuable and two weekends in a row I made plans that feel through. I said maybe there was too much baggage here. She apologized and said she wanted to make it up to me. I said there was no reason to do that. We could just be casual friends like before. But if she ever wanted to hangout late night when she has more time then she had my number. That was the end of it. Well starting on Monday Chrissy has been pissed at me. I stopped at their place last night she had comments for me. I told her my side and she said I knew Becca had kids and that things would pop up. I said I knew they would, but I don’t my time being wasted. While Becca was cute her lifestyle is not something I’m into. So we could go back to the way things were. Chrissy kept going at me in a way I’ve never seen before. Me and Trenton gamed last night and he said she’s still mad. But thinks it might just be pregnancy hormones. AITA?",1
"I (29F) have been with my fiancé (34M) for over a year now and together we have 3 kids. Two from his preivous relationship and one from mine. We have been learning how to coparent but it hasnt always been easy. For context, my fiancé LOVES to cook. It's his passion and he has always done majority of the cooking, espically dinner, ever since our first date. His two kids, (4 and 6) also love majority of the things he makes. My son(8), however, is a very picky eater. I know its partly my fault for not knowing how to cook and for being a single mom for so many years I just used the easy way out.

Well, when I met my fiancé and saw how bad our diets were (lots of chicken nuggets and ramen) I really wanted to make it better. However, the changes have not been easy for my son. There has been a lot of complaining and nose turning at the new foods for the last year. And Its not always anything fancy, even spaghetti he refuses to eat. This is where things got fustrating.

Tonight, my fiancé was going to cook enchalidas for dinner and my son, as ususal, didnt want it and asked for nuggets. My fiance basically threw up his hands while prepping dinner and has now said that he will no longer cook for this household because he is tired of his food be snarked and pushed away. He says I can do what I want for my son and I but he will no longer be disrespected. I am extremely upset and all I see is red. Granted, I know he doesnt have to cook for me but I have fallen in love with his food and I feel so damn fustrated. Am I the asshole or is he right?

EDIT: I dont just let me son be a complete uncontrolled brat to my fiancé. If he whines or gets bratty he is punished or grounded. Every meal, I hype my fiancés food, hoping he'll want to eat too and that sometimes works! And even if he doesnt take much, I make sure he tells my fiancé thank you for cooking. And I'll make him apologize if he says something disrespectfully. I do realize my fiancé is coming into a situation he didnt create.",1
"A few years ago, two close friends of mine got together. He had been in another relationship a few months prior, but according to my information there was no overlap.  
  
Nevertheless, over the next few years, his ex reached out to him numerous times, trying to get closure. She also started reaching out to his new girlfriend (that she knew from before) and his best friend. Begging for answers.  
  
In time I pieced together that he ghosted his ex without a word. I felt this was appalling behavior and I told him as much. I told all three of them that I felt she deserved answers. None of them stepped up.  
  
I’m not in contact with any of these people today, but I still sometimes think of that ex girlfriend. Apparently it was as recently as last summer she reached out to try to get some answers.  
  
I wrote her a letter, and I wanted to ask opinions here, would I be the asshole if I sent it? If I do, am I just stirring the pot? Do you think she would appreciate the opportunity to get answers?  
  
*Hello X.*  
  
*I have been thinking about you regularly for the past few years. My heart has gone out for you, for how A and G treated you.*   
  
*I know you’ve been reaching out to both A, G and J regularly, for information. If you had reached out to me I would have answered your questions, but you never did.*   
  
*The story as I thought it was, was this: you moved away in the fall of 2019, and you and A's relationship ended, somewhat fizzled out if A is to be believed. In the spring of 2020, A and G became a couple.*  
  
*Throughout the years, all three of them have mentioned in passing how you’ve been trying to reach out and get some information on things with A, which made me in time put two and two together that he probably just ghosted you, without ever having a formal conversation with you about your relationship. Basically, that he just hopped from you, to G, without a word. This is behaviour that I’ve always felt was appalling, and I was very clear, whenever it came up, that I felt you deserved better.*   
  
*I was clear with A, which never answered anything. I was clear with G, which absolved herself of any responsibility, just saying that she felt this was A's thing to deal with, and I was clear with J, saying to him that if I were in his shoes, i.e. if you had come directly to me and asked, I would have been honest with you, as I don’t think it’s right to let a person sit with all kinds of unanswered questions and thoughts.*  
  
*I’m not sure I’m doing the right thing by sending you this. I don’t feel this is my business, really. But I still think about this, and if you do too, and need some answers, I’m willing to answer what I can.*  
  
*Know that I feel you deserve better than the treatment you got from them. It never felt good, standing on the sidelines and hearing your pleas of communication go unanswered. Which is why I’m sending this now.*  
  
*Take care.*",1
"My former partner and I own property in Ireland. It's where his father is from and it ranks within both of our respective top three favorite places. It was his dad's engagement gift to us. He and I ended up ending things based on circumstances out of our control (distance and timing aren't always kind) but we're still close friends. And we still co-own a vacation home in a foreign country.

The one rule we made for the property was that new flames aren't allowed to be taken there. Both of us have always respected this and it's not something that comes up much since most of the trips either of us take there are family vacations where both of us are invited alongside siblings and parents. It's not exactly being used for romantic getaways.

I have been seeing my current girlfriend for eight months now. I'll be going back to Ireland this summer with my best friend/co-owner and his brothers, and my girlfriend expressed interest in tagging along. She has never been to Ireland and wanted me to play tour guide. I told her that she was technically ""banned"" from the house we would all be staying in, but she was free to get a hotel if she wanted to join us. I thought it was all very lighthearted. She had heard me talking about the trip for a few weeks now and had only just begun expressing interest in attending, so I didn't think she was serious.

It has turned into a big fight between us where I'm being called an asshole for even considering going someplace that she is ""banned.""

"I (F, 23), have a friendship within a group of 5 people, 4 of us are friends from high school, and one we know from church. Members of our group, let's call them James (M, 22), Brad (M, 23), Lily (F, 23), and Susan (F, 27). We first met when we were in high school, then we went to the same church and got to know Susan because she is older than us so we don’t go to school together. When we graduated from high school, I, James, Brad, and Lily moved to another city for college and work. Lily, Brad, and James work together. Two years later, Susan joined us move to our city to work with as Lily as well, then after a few years of working, Susan resigned to work elsewhere. When we were together in this city, Lily had a much older boyfriend than her, let's call him Joe (M, 38). Joe is very possessive of Lily and this is one of the reasons for the rift in our group. Recently, James and Lily had a misunderstanding, but because of that, Joe forbids Lily from being friends with James again. I sided with James, while Brad sided with Lily and Joe because he worked with Lily, replacing Susan. After that, our relationship became strained, but one fine evening James called me and told me that it turns out Joe, who is very possessive, is ch**ting on Lily with Susan. Susan eventually became suspicious of the presence of me and James who knew about her aff**r, so she became hostile towards us. Currently, she is getting closer to Lily, Joe, and Brad while I and James still keeping this secret. Initially, I wanted to tell Lily that Joe is actually ch\*\*t on her with Susan, but Lily is currently blinded by her love for Joe so I am confused about how to tell her, and even if I do tell her, there is a high chance she will still forgive Joe and their relationship will continue, although Joe will definitely forbid Lily from being friends with me as well. So currently, I feel like I won't tell Lily about this fact anytime soon. AITA?",1
"I (F20's) was driving home from work this afternoon when I almost hit a little girl. The road where my work is located is a busy road with many side streets. I always do 35mph (the posted speed limit) and set my cruise control, as I'd done this afternoon. I was not distracted or impaired in anyway, I was watching the road and fully following traffic laws.

There was a car in front of me. The girl who was around 11 on a scooter was scootering up towards the main road from one of the side roads. She almost didn't stop for the car in front of me but she did. She watched that car go and waited as the car going the opposite way beside it passed. She didn't look in my direction as she scootered into the road. Though I saw her I didn't expect her to scooter in front of me so I slammed on brakes though I stopped about a car and a half's length away from her. She jerked away and ended up falling backwards into a shallow ditch. I pulled over and ran over to her. She was crying but I think it was more fear than injury.

I made sure she was okay physically, she said she was. I then set into her on how dangerous her actions were, what was she thinking, why didn't she look both ways, if she didn't understand traffic safety then she shouldn't be on a scooter on a busy street. She cried. I told her that I wanted to speak to her parents because honestly she should have known better and if she didn't know better then they aren't parenting properly. She wasn't wearing a helmet or pads and she had EarPods in so I assume she was listening to music, but if she was she wasn't by the time I got to her. 

She took me to her home where I spoke to her parents and told them what had happened and asked why they were letting an obviously ill-prepared child ride anything without teaching her safety. The girl told her parents that she had just made a mistake but that I was being ""really mean"". I told her that she should be grateful that it's me being ""really mean"" to her and not a doctor telling her parents that their child was dead. I asked her how she thought her parents would feel if I'd hit her, how I would feel. I told the parents to either teach her properly or keep her off the streets.

The dad told me I was a dick and I shouldn't be telling people how to raise their kids. The mom said I was overreacting and that I was probably driving too fast or dangerously. I have dash cam so I'm not worried about accusations on my driving, I was 100% following traffic laws. The dad told me to get off their property before he called the cops. I told him to go ahead and I'd show the cops the dash cam video and I assume that any cop would fault the parents for letting a child run around a busy street without supervision or proper safety lessons. They slammed the door in my face and I went back to my car and went home.

Was I an asshole?",1
"I'm a big fan of Gatorade, and I have a specific reason for buying it. I have low blood sugar and dehydration issues, and my doctor recommended that I drink Gatorade to help keep my electrolytes in balance. However, I'm also neurodivergent and its hard for me to change things up and try new flavors, so I only buy the red kind as it's the only one I like.

Yesterday, I went to the grocery store on their stock day, and I saw that they had a fresh shipment of Gatorade. I was so happy, because I had been running low at home. I grabbed the bottles of the red flavour and put them in my cart.

As I was walking away, a mom with two kids approached me and asked if I could spare a few bottles of the red Gatorade. She explained that it was her kids favourite flavour, and that they were out of stock at their local store. I felt bad for her, but I explained that I needed the Gatorade for my own health reasons, and that I couldn't spare any.

The mom got really upset and started to yell at me, saying that I was being selfish and that I should think about others. I tried to explain my situation again, but she wouldn't listen and kept telling me I could just take the blue Gatorade instead. I just started to ignore her after a while, and eventually, she stormed off.

Now I'm wondering if I was in the wrong. Should I have given her some of the Gatorade, even though I needed it for my own health? Or was I justified in keeping it all for myself? AITA?


Edit:: I should clarify since this is coming up in the comments- I didn’t really want to go into specifics but here we are…. No, my doctor did not recommend specifically red gatorade for this issue. He recommended gatorade. The red gatorade is needed because I deal with  OCD and have issues with change to my routine and trying new things… it can be debilitating to deal with panic attacks induced by such a “small” problem and can remove my focus from my process of treating the bigger problems with my OCD, so I have chosen (at the advise of a therapist) to allow myself to stick to this small routine and avoid further disruption during my process of getting better.

EDITING AGAIN: Thank you everyone for your comments… I am going to stop replying now as this is getting really overwhelming for me. I guess the consensus is that I am TA, I suppose I will accept that.

I wish my food aversion was something I could just turn off but I can’t and its a process to work through these things for me. I hope people in the comments can understand that I am not trying to intentionally be an asshole and take things from other people, I just have a fear of not being able to keep the little things in my routine and that feeling trumps a lot of things for me. If you don’t struggle with OCD be grateful…

"My sister and I our visiting our two nieces who are 6 and 8 for Thanksgiving. My sister picked them up from school and apparently my younger niece wanted to go to the park to play and my sister agreed to take them. When they got home, I was watching cartoons on YouTube and my older niece wanted to watch with me. My sister said wanted both of us to come to the park, but I didn't feel like going so I said that my older niece could stay home with me if she wanted to. My sister (who is in medical school btw) said that kids need to get at least an hour outside a day, so I said I'd take my niece outside to play with chalk for an hour. 
After my sister and younger niece left, I took my older niece outside to ""draw our feelings"" on the sidewalk with chalk. She drew a TV and a Switch playing Minecraft. I drew a jellyfish. We sang a song together and complained about how annoying sisters can be sometimes. After an hour, I said it was ok to go back inside and my niece ran inside to the TV. I showed her some funny animations on YouTube which she loved, and I played Animal Crossing.
When my sister and younger niece got home, they told me how much fun they had had at the park and I chatted with them for awhile. My older niece didn't respond much to what my sister said because I think she was still a little mad at her. I played a few boardgames with my younger niece and sister and then they went outside to play hopscotch while I stayed inside to watch YouTube with my older niece.
After the kids went to bed, I was talking with my sister and our oldest sister (our nieces' mom) and she mentioned that she would like for my oldest niece to watch less TV and do more things that are active and use her brain. My sister agreed, but I said that my niece had used her brain at school and had seemed tired so probably just didn't feel up to it.
Here's some notable context. My sister does not like watching TV. She does not own a TV herself and hates the TV being on for any extended period of time because it gives her a headache. It was the a Friday right before a long weekend and I knew the kid's Dad was taking them on a surprise trip to the trampoline park the next day. My older niece suffers from anxiety and insomnia, which I also struggle with and relate to. 
Am I the asshole for letting my niece do whatever she wants instead of forcing her to make healthy choices?",1
"I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Nursing. My grandma and grandpa gave me $800, my dad gave me $400 dollars, and my mom hasn't given me anything so far. I probably come off as entitled with this question but I feel like I could have gotten more. Last year my brother graduated with a bachelors in business administration from an online school and got 1000 dollars each from everyone. And no offense but he doesn't have a job or anything, just sits at home. I want to move out and start working as a nurse but 1200 dollars doesn't really give me a good chance at doing that. AITA for expecting more money just because of how much my brother got?",1
"My daughter Rose (9) is a very advanced reader. She’s in 3rd grade (8-9 year olds) but reads at a 9th grade (14-15 years old) level. 

Despite her advanced reading level, the only books she wants to read are the I Survived series and the A-Z mysteries. Both of these books are far below her reading level so I told her it’s fine if she wants to read them in school but at home she has to read things closer to her level. 

I’ve taken her to bookstores and we’ve looked through the young adult section but she refuses to read any of the books. She says they’re all boring and gross. She always asks to get books from the children’s section but I’ve said no because they’re too easy for her. 

Rose has started sneaking books home from school and when I started taking those away, she stopped reading in general. Now Rose has pulled away from me and her teacher is recommending that I let her read whatever she wants. 

Rose’s dad (my ex) found out about this and tore into me for not letting Rose read books for kids her age and offered to send her books but that’s not the problem. I don’t have a problem with Rose reading but if she’s going to read, she should read something close to her level. 

Now everyone’s mad at me so I wanted to know if I was the asshole",1
"My (55M) wife of two years (31) is very unhappy with her life because she feels like there’s never anything fun or important to do.

She did not finish college and feels too old to do so, so jobs are also out of the question. 

So it is no wonder that when her sister said she wanted to start her own boutique and take my wife on as a business partner that my wife’s moods started drastically shifting upwards.

Starting a boutique is rather costly and it’s been tough to get investment on their end because potential investors are saying that there’s too many boutiques. 

But I believe in their passion and think that this if it worked out would be a good chance for my wife to feel like she’s doing something meaningful.

I’m not terribly liquid right now, but it will be another 4 years before my daughter goes to college, so I ended up investing $30,000 from the fund that her late mother and I put together.

I told her and she was furious with me and kept trashing my wife’s business idea saying it was dumb and she was dumb.

AITA? It’s not like my daughter is going to college soon but right now I really want to make my wife happy and not go into an early midlife crisis because she feels powerless in her life. 

She said herself this was a chance for her to do something important for her life.",1
"

My pregnant wife (26f) and I (35m)are really struggling at the moment as I lost my job and my wife had to quit her job as she’s suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum. We’ve used up our savings and currently are living off our credit cards but I’ve got a job lined,starting in march. My wife is very close to her sister (31f) and a few days ago she confided in her that we are struggling. Her sister has never liked me but has always been polite to me. She has always kept me at arms length despite my attempts at trying to foster a warmer relationship. 

A few days ago my sister in law came to visit while I was away and she was appalled at the state of the house and the lack of baby supplies, as the baby room was bare bones and we hadn’t bought many baby things. When I arrived back home she had given me a lecture on taking better care of her sister and scolded me for not getting ready for the baby. The next day she came back and she had bought things for the house and the baby. My wife also told her that we had to sell her car to pay off some bills and rent. Again my sil had to show off and she bought her a car and to top it all off on sunday she sent her 50k and then texted her this - “This is your money and your baby’s. Do not use it on that man. If you need more tell me and I’ll send more. And remember wherever I am there’s a home for you.”

I feel like her sister trying to make me look like a failure and I expressed that to my wife. My wife and I argued and in a fit of anger my wife said that I only feel like a failure because I’ve been failing. She has apologized since but I still stand by telling her to return everything as I feel like accepting her sisters so called generosity is a way to manipulate my wife into thinking I’m bad husband.

Edit: Okay I get it I’m the asshole. I’ll apologize to my wife and sister in law. It hurt but thank you for the brutal feedback!

"My wife and I have this ongoing debate. where she would ask for a snack when were watching Tv or whatever. And let's say she ask for tea and a rice cake with nutella (which she did  today) i told her that iwill bring her the Nutella jar ,a knive and the bag of rice cakes, she would then say never mind then i want nothing. so i did make the single Nutella rice cake and tea. But in my mind i dont understand what is so wrong with bringing the whole thing, if she want more or if i want some its there... its been a on going thing. not just for the rice cakes, but with snacks in general,  Its an issue if i bring the whole thing instead of just one or a few unless she specifically ask for the whole bag.. She used grilled cheese as an example.. said if i asked fora grilled cheese will i bring you a block of cheese and a loaf of bread... i pointed that it was a bad exeple but to her its a perfect exemple.. so which is it i am wrong here?",1
"I (23F) just got out of a long-term relationship with Mike (24M) of 2 years. We did mid-distance so we never got to see much of each other. There was mis-communication and I ended up cheating on him with a friend. He found out via a mutual friend so he called it off. I know what I did was wrong but this isn't about that.

Mike left a few of his things at my house and asked me to visit him or at least meet me halfway to drop them off. I refused. Why should I travel for hours to drop his things off? He also said that because he spent so much money visiting me toward the end of our relationship (though-out we travelled 50-50 but I could never find the time to go to him so he came to me and said **he didn't mind**) that I should be willing to do this. I still maintain my position and told him I wouldn't be travelling. Then he asked me to mail his things to him but because of the value of the items, I refused as I don't want the blame if they get lost in the mail. 

I was venting to my friends and they said while it's understandable I don't want to travel and see him, that this is a selfish thing to do. Especially when he is asking me to mail them and cover the cost so I don't need to travel. So AITA?",1
"I (F26) was talking to one of my grandma's friends yesterday and during the chat, we brought up my aunt, A, which eventually led the conversation to my uncle, J.

J and I don't really get along, he's humiliated me several times in front of friends and family for being autistic (he hates when I behave like an autistic person in front of him).

Anyway, grandma's friend mentioned that her son used to work with J, and he once got in a heated argument with him at work and J only shut up when the guy said he knows his dirt and that if he said anything, J’s marriage would be over. I was confused by this, as I've known J as kind of a jerk but never heard anything about him being unfaithful. 

That story has to be at least 3 years old, J has another job now (he was fired, idk why). She added that J used to “try to have sex” with pretty much every woman who worked under him. I was so shocked I barely had any reaction to this and didn't ask her to elaborate.

I thought about it for a bit and decided not to do anything about the information I've been told, as I have no way to prove it and I know my entire family would turn on me if I made such an accusation with no proof. I feel awful about it bc I'm really close to my cousin and aunt and I know they deserve better than J (even if the accusation isn't true).

I'm not sure how I'll be able to keep this from A and my cousin but I feel I have no choice. I'm asking if not saying anything would make me the asshole bc if I were in A’s shoes, I'd want to know, and hiding this from my cousin makes me feel like I'm betraying her.

More information in case it is needed: 

A and J have been married for approximately 30 years.

J goes on a lot of “business trips”

A is a great person who's kind, caring, and beautiful, and J is… not. He's not ugly but since they got married he really let himself go while my aunt has always been encouraged to hit the gym and make sure she stays good looking forever.

They have 1 kid (F21), and J has more than once bodyshamed her, and been controlling about her food intake (he's yelled at her for eating sugary things several times to my knowledge)

J makes a lot more money than A and she's a bit financially dependent on him for that reason. I’ve witnessed J screaming at A, their daughter, and their dog multiple times, and when he gets drunk he is even worse.

I suspect J has Intermittent Explosive Disorder (I have a degree in psychology but I'm obviously not diagnosing him, it's just a suspicion) and/or another disorder but he refuses to get help as he doesn't believe in therapy (A even told me once J didn't believe depression existed until his daughter got it).

I've never witnessed J being unfaithful but when talking on the phone with female coworkers or literally any woman outside his family he usually calls them sweetheart, darling, and all of those demeaning names that men sometimes use when talking to women they don't respect. 

So, WIBTA if I don't say anything to my aunt and cousin? I'm willing to accept any advice people are willing to give me about this situation as well.",1
"My BIL (24) moved with me and my husband (his brother) after he broke up with ex girlfriend due to infidelity. I've cleaned and prepared his room for him and he's been staying with us for few days.


His ex girlfriend showed up while I was alone at home and asked me if I could go get my BIL's ship model for her. I asked why and she told me he gifted it to her so it was hers. I went into his room, looked through his closet to find it then gave it to her. She thanked me and left.


BIL got home and then before dinner he rushed out of his room asking if we anyone saw his ship model. I told him his ex girlfriend showed up and asked me to get it for her since she said he gifted it to her. He was shocked initially, he then went off on me saying she was lying, that this ship model is worth over 2k and that it's a family herilom that he inherited from his dad. I asked him to please calm down and not raise his voice at me when he's a guest at my home. He told me I had no right to enter his room let alone go through his stuff then give something of high value to his ex. We got into an argument and my husband said that I messed up by going into his room in the first place. I reminded him that this is my home and I don't permission from anyone to enter any room in the house. They both gave me the cold shoulder and BIL started complaining about having to go through hell to get the ship model back and mentioned police saying what his ex did was theft and basically blamed me saying I ""technically"" helped her by touching stuff that isn't mine without permission.


I think they're being harsh and unreasonable. But AITA?",1
"I (60) just found out my DIL is seriously rich. I mean millions of dollars rich. Actually my first son found out and told me.

I have five children, two older daughters 40 and 38 before meeting my wife and have three more kids. M(35), M(30) and F(18).

Only my son M(30) is married with a son. All my other children still rely on me pretty much for everything. We are not rich and we are all managing.

My son got married two years ago. I should have suspected my DIL is rich due to the type of wedding they had. My DIL's family paid for the wedding and my family was not asked to contribute anything so I never took notice. She is an only child so I thought her mother just went overboard for her. 

They live in my DIL's house and after the wedding my son hardly visits. He never bothers me with his issues so I also never bothered with him. I saw him drive a new car but I thought it is from work, maybe he got a new job. 

My first son somehow found out my DIL is very rich and told me. I invited my  second son over and asked him. He said they are doing okay but if his wife is rich, that is his wife's money and it shouldn't concern us. 

I told him that she is my DIL and practically family and she much help the whole family if she can afford it because that's what family do. He told me they signed a prenup and she has done more than enough for him. He showed me how much he earns monthly and says that he is doing his best with his income to take care of his wife and child, he doesn't have any to spare. He asked me to stay out of their business.

I called my DIL over and spoke to her. I didn't ask her for any financial help but I told her the family is straggling. She empathized but did not offer any help. 

In the past few days I have discovered a lot about my DIL's family. My DIL is a simple lady and nothing about her shows her wealth. I wonder why my son is not helping us out. 

Now my other children are coming over to talk about their brother and complaining about their issues, fees for their children, rent and others. No one is asking but there is tension. 

AITA for asking my son to help his family financially?",1
"I (26M) have a 5 year old child with my ex (26F). We share custody of him through verbal agreement. We split time pretty equally between both parties and things have been pretty smooth for the most part. She got a new bf almost 2 years ago now and it was a weird transition but i believe for the most part i been pretty welcoming and cooperative with the whole thing since he is involved in my childs life as well. They have another younger baby now as well. For the most part we are all on the same page when it comes to my son and he's a cool dude i dont have a problem with him. 

&#x200B;

A couple months back now, my ex and I involved my child in sports and hes been doing taekwondo. On her days she or her bf take my son to practice and on my days i take him. Things were smooth. There were boundaries and we didnt really interfere in each others days with my son since he loves to spend time with us both. Things started getting a little rocky however a couple weeks back when her bf decided to join the same TKD my son did. Again me trying to cooperate said no problem, you guys do what you think is best on your days i trust you. I wont lie, it felt a little intrusive for some reason but i feel like its something i just have to deal with as a single dad. Things again took a nosedive when on the day i was supposed to take my son to practice my ex's bf took him instead since he was going there now too. I got upset and said since it was my day i felt like they stole that day from me. I talked to her bf and i told him that as cool as he was i didnt really want to go see another grown ass man practicing next to my child on a taekwondo class that i pay for but that on my ex's day with my son he was more than welcome to take my him to practice if she wanted him to. 

&#x200B;

Forward today, my ex messages me and tells me that my son is getting a promotion to yellow belt this Friday and that her bf is also happening to test for his belt on the same day and same time. Keep in mind, this is falling on my weekend. I told her that i feel i needed a little space to experince son and father things with my son without any interference and that i felt a little suffocated. She said its a public space and her bf can be there too as well. I told her i felt my boundaries as a parent were not being respected and i told her i didnt want him there. We went back and forth and got into an argument about it. I dont know if being too possesive with the time im supposed to spend with my son or if im not being inclusive enough with his now other side of the family, his step-dad now, technically. We're friends but i dont want to be best friends with him. Certainly dont want to share my time with my son with him since he can see him on the days my son is with his mom. AITA?",1
"I'm a first grade teacher and my daughter is a preschool teacher. She's a second year teacher. She was a teaching assistant for a year while she got the credits required to teach. Her school opened a second location with one classroom and she currently runs the location from 12-6:30 every day. 

When she started working at the school, I noticed she was running to the dollar tree or Walmart to grab little things for her classroom like hair ties, stickers, beads, and string. She said she didn't mind because it was all cheap and made her job easier. Then when she got her own classroom, she really started looking on next-door and buy nothing and shopping for her classroom more often. She got 24 outfits to store in her class (3 in each size from 2-5 for boys and girls) in case the parents forget to send new clothes, she has a box of pull ups in case a kid has an accident and doesn't have a spare pair of underwear, she has extra snacks, she has extra jackets and socks, a pack of combs and brushes, extra nap bedding, and bins of what she calls ""stalling activities"" (easy things she can pull out when she needs to stall). She even has halloween costumes in case one of her students doesn't have one and she gives away the blankets and jackets if she thinks a student needs them. 

I told her that all of this is excessive and she should leave it up to the owner of the school to get these things. She said the owner says these things aren't necessary but they don't cost much and they make her classroom run smoother. I told her that if the owner says it's unnecessary, don't get these things and let her see how the class runs without them. I told her I don't spend any money on my classroom and that if my principal isn't willing to buy it, the kids don't need it. She says it's different because I work at a $30k+ per year private school and she teaches in a more lower income community but I still told her it's not her responsibility. I also told her that her buying stuff for her classroom makes all of us that don't look bad but she doesn't care.

She's upset with me for being pushy but I'm just doing what's best for her. AITA?",1
"I (34F) am 13 weeks pregnant with our first child. My husband (33M) was doing some dumb stuff yesterday, and just generally be inconsiderate. He's human, I get it, but it doesn't make it okay.

Dumb stuff includes: coming downstairs at 11:30 asking me ""whats for lunch?"" when he bought ham sandwich ingredients the night before. I said ""the ham sandwich stuff but I have a 12 oclock deadline that I cant miss, so go ahead and make the sandwiches, but dont forget that you have to cook my ham fully before, cause of the baby"". I get done with my deadline stuff around 12:05, I go into the kitchen and hes out back with the dog, he's already eaten and he hadn't made my sandwich cause he was scared he wouldnt do it right (his words not mine). \*sigh\*

So I got mad because...... well because he made a bad call, and now Im pregnant, and starving, and he's full, and he didnt MAKE ME MY SANDWICH.

It all sounds dumb, which I get, but it was inconsiderate so I was mildly mad at him.

Anywho, we're also already fighting because he's a mandated reporter and we have concerns about the kids next door, and something happened this morning that made us call CPS (yelling obscenities, etc etc), but he just didn't sound super worried over the phone with CPS, and CPS has decided not to pursue an investigation of our neighbor.... and I honestly think it's because my husband was very monotone in his call and he didnt really SOUND worried. I think if you're worried, you need to sound worried but he believes that he needs to be factual and unemotional. Again, different perspectives, I see his but I believe I'm right.

So basically every interaction yesterday was us fighting because of different things.....

After the lunch debacle, we were fighting and goes ""I dont know why you're acting all crazy! Where is this all coming from?""

........................

...........................

So I basically snapped, and said ""You have NO IDEA what a crazy woman is like because you've basically only dated me and I'm rather level-headed.... I'll show you crazy!!"".... So I haven't really spoken to him since, I slept in the guest room, I ate dinner separately, etc etc....

I'm really pissed off, and he's said he was sorry after I told him he was being a turd, and I said ""I dont accept your apology, you called your pregnant wife CRAZY, what were you thinking?""....

Note: this morning we talked for a second and I said ""I still dont accept your apology, I dont think you understand how badly you messsed up by calling your pregnant wife crazy?"" and he said ""I didn't.... I dont think it was that bad of a thing to say!"" So now Im IRRITATED AGAIN!!!

So, AITA for giving him the silent treatment because not only was he kind of a jerk yesterday, he called me crazy, and then doesn't think it was that big of a deal??!?!?!?

Update:So I read through a MILLION YTA's and quite a few soft YTAs.... and then some people were in the middle.He went out to run errands at lunch and brought us back lunch and so we sat down and discussed it. I told him that the world o' reddit has determined that I'm the AH because of the reasons you all mentioned below. I apologized for being irritated with his tone with CPS. I told him that he was right and being rational and fact-based was the best tactic and I took my frustration with CPS out on him and that wasn't fair. I said that I felt that the sandwich thing was inconsiderate and I asked him to not worry about making it incorrectly next time because as long as the ham is cooked, I'd rather an ""incorrectly made"" sandwich than to go hungry longer than necessary.

He then apologized for calling me crazy, clarified that he wouldn't be offended if someone called him crazy, but he sees that it hurt my feelings and invalidated my feelings, and he didn't mean to do that.

I think we've resolved the problem, and I do appreciate everyone's perspectives..... except the people who said we're gonna be neglectful parents because we had one bad day/afternoon. I don't appreciate that perspective because it jumps to some pretty unfair conclusions.

Thanks everyone!

Update 2: Wow, holy moly.... I've decided to stop responding to everyone because you guys are SERIOUSLY getting critical of a fight between two people who have been together for 11+ years. Some of you guys understand where my frustration initially came from and it was understandable, and acknowledge that I overreacted. I wholeheartedly agree with that, and I apologized. Some of you believe that marriage is the same as roommates, and that's unfortunate. We make each other meals when we make our own. If he's working on something, I'll make him food and have it waiting on him when he's done, and he does the same thing. This is a normal way that our household runs. Some of you believe my husband is some moron who doesn't understand how to do simple things like making a sandwich, and I reject that. He's an incredibly intelligent man who dropped the ball on lunch. He's allowed to make a mistake but I'm not going to pretend like he can't figure out a solution to a problem. He is brilliant, and he can problem solve. This man knows about heating up meat to a high enough temperature for his pregnant wife to eat, he knows how to make a sandwich, and he knows he was supposed to make lunch. He literally just had a brain fart. I wont apologize for being irritated and you guys are all wrong if you think I should apologize. He said he was going to do something, and didn't do it. I'm not sorry for being irritated about that. 

Either way, I appreciate everyone who didn't severely criticize me and saw the truth of the situation, and offered sincere advice. ",1
"I (37M) work for a small tech company, my local university has a partnership with our company and invite some of us to judge a game jam competition where students have 3 days to make a small game in groups. I was one of the judges.

There were a lot of groups that were mixed gender, some with just guys and 3 groups with only girls. 2 of the girl groups dropped out the first day as they felt they could not get their idea done.

When I passed by the work area of the remaining girl group, I saw that they were making really good progress and I complimented them on their game, said it was looking really good and mentioned that the other girl groups dropped out but it looks like they are surviving. One of the girls got upset at me and said I should not be complimenting their project in a way that implies it is good work for a girl project.

She was visibly cold with me for the rest of the competition and glared at me. And I think she complained to someone because, later I got a message from a manager about making sure I was sensitive about the lack of women in CS.

I still gave their project a good score as it was really good and my 3rd favorite. They ended up winning and my 1st and 2nd pick came 2nd and 4th respectively.

AITA for complimenting their project?

EDIT: Ok I get the point, I will be more careful next time and I kind of get it, however it was not my intent to make her feel that way. I thought I was encouraging them. It never directly said something like good work for a girl.",1
"So I've been with my girlfriend for just under a year. We don't live together yet but we plan on moving in together around April (I'm finishing renovations in my house). She has a daughter (14) from a previous marriage. I don't really interact with her daughter that much, we'll say hi to each other etc but we've never actually spent any one on one time. On Tuesday my gf called me and asked if I could pick up her daughter from school and take her to lunch because she had to stay late at work. I was free so I agreed. I decided to take my bike because the weather was pretty decent (it was cold but it wasn't raining). So after I picked her daughter up we went for some kebabs and afterwards her daughter asked me if she could ride around with me for a bit before I take her home. I didn't know she was into motorcycles so I thought that this might be my opportunity to ""bond"" with her. So we drove around on some countryside roads for about an hour and then I dropped her off. 

That same evening my gf called me and she was furious that I picked her daughter up from school on my bike. I told her that she never said I couldn't use my bike. We had a small argument and she called me selfish and irresponsible. But I still think I didn't do anything wrong. AITA here?",1
"Ok so I actually feel horrible about this idk why I said it but I've been really stressed.. and I wasn't thinking clearly before I spoke 

So My [algebra II H] teacher usually says the hw wasn't due until the day of the test and we'd get full credits up until then(in a week) so I didn't do it one day and he called my parents to tell them I'm falling behind. (I'm one of the best kids in the class on test grades) and my parents got all pissed cause apparently he said I was failing another class [AP Seminar] (there were only 2 assignments and one had been mistakenly put in as a 0) but he didn't care to ask my other teacher before calling. 

He does stuff like this to every kid and is known as the worst teacher in school.
He gets mad at kids for working on homework for his class during the class period, he picks favorites and doesn't let kids retake a test when they miss the unit, and he uses his personal trauma to trauma dump in class for math ie. *Long ass story* ""so there's most likely a high *probability* she died of cancer""

Anyway so ff to today

He's starts talking in class about how he assigns so much hw because we only teach the class in a semester not a year.
So here's how it pans out

 Me: so if you say you add all the extra homework because we only have one semester, then why doesn't the homework go more in depth/explain new aspects to the topic instead of being just a repeat of what we did in class?

Teacher: well some kids don't always need to do the homework, so I guess if you have good enough test scores then you don't have to do it. The grades aren't weighted in favor of it anyway

Me: so you're saying the hw doesn't actually matter?

Teacher: yes

Me: so them why do you email everyones parents the second we don't do it?

Teacher: that seems like a conversation to be had not in front of a class.

-----end of convo, whole class was quiet and eventually some kids started laughing.

Also to be clear I've emailed my counselors hundreds of times asking to be switched out of this class but we ""can't switch if we don't like the teacher""

"I work for maintenance at my complex. 

This girl just moved in for a job in the city. She randomly appeared with a dog, so I looked her profile up in our system and noticed that she did not have a dog on the lease. 

The dog seems good and he doesn’t bark throughout the day. I just felt like it was wrong for her to bring a dog without putting the dog in the lease, quite frankly cheap. 

I told the leasing office and they have noticed her to get rid of the dog or put it on the lease. She used to greet me if we crossed paths, but now she turns the other way or ignores me. I know the leasing office told her that I notified them. AITA for letting them know that she brought a dog?

Edit: Ok. I have read almost all of these responses and I get it. It was a creepy thing to do. I didn’t think further into it. I should’ve put myself into her shoes before writing about this because if I was a woman and a man did this to me, I’d be creeped out as well. I have learned my lesson and will refrain from doing any of this from here on out.

Edit 2: I think this is really getting out of hand. I do not have any interest in her and was just curious since I kinda know which dogs belong to which owners. I know I made a mistake and I won’t do it again.",1
"A friend James of mine is having a destination wedding in Cancun in January. I’m also engaged and getting married later in January locally in the city I live in. He’s invited me to his destination wedding in Cancun, and I’ve noticed there happens to be an event in Tulum (close to Cancun) which I might enjoy organizing my bachelor party around. The Tulum event is on a Wednesday, and the wedding would be on a Saturday. Would I be the asshole for making the trip do “double duty” by going out early, having my bachelor party in Tulum, then attending his Cancun wedding three days later?

Possibly helpful additional context: this is a slightly more recently made friend, known him about a year and a half or so. We have a couple of mutual friends (who I’ve also only met recently) but not a lot; the invite list for my bachelor party would mostly be people that don’t know James, so I don’t think there’s any concern about mutual friends being forced to choose between the two events, and if the like one mutual friend that might possibly be interested in both could only make his wedding I’d be fine with that. I’d be fine with holding off on making any bachelor party related social media posts or sharing any pics until well after the wedding if that was his preference. I assume it would mean James himself couldn’t attend, as I’m guessing he’d be busy getting ready for his own wedding, but by the same token I doubt he’d have been able to make any destination bachelor party I did anyway, whether in Cancun or elsewhere.

My fiancée seems convinced this would be a serious breach of social etiquette, regardless of any practical concerns. I’ve had a hard time nailing down exactly why from her, beyond just some “stealing their thunder” line of reasoning? Obviously I’d ask my friend if this was ok with him, and if he wasn’t I could nix that idea, I’m not hard committed to it yet or anything, just seems like a convenient way to make the destination wedding trip do double duty in a spot that would be fun for the bachelor party anyway. Before I even bring it up with him though: regardless of this particular grooms specific feelings either way, would it in general be widely seen as bad social etiquette to have a bachelor party like this in a city close to a friends destination wedding earlier in the week? And second theoretical question: if this is ruled acceptable for grooms and bachelor parties, would it also be acceptable for brides and bachelorette parties?",1
"My wife (35F) and I (35M) have been together for 10 years, married 5. We grew up completely different. She's the only child of a surgeon father. Her mother died when she was 2 and it was her and her father for most of her life. He remarried when she was 17. He's wealthy, sent her to private school, paid for her college, and when we met a decade ago he was still paying her rent, even though she had a solid job. I come from a poor family. But we both have pretty good jobs and make around the same amount of money now.

She is such a daddy's girl and it's been affecting our relationship. Anytime she wants or needs something, she goes to her dad first. And sometimes it's about things I could help with. I work in tech and back when we started dating she was starting grad school and she asked her dad ""what laptop should I get""  I told her I actually work in the field (which she already knew) and could easily answer that and get her what she needs and she just kind of shrugged. Okay fine. These little things have happened throughout the last decade. But, there have been bigger issues recently.
Last year, she decided she needs a new car. I disagreed. Her car is fine and she works from home and barely drives. She was adamant, though. About a month later, she tells me she's getting a new car. I told her we need to make these decisions together and we share finances and this is a major purchase. She says, ""oh, my dad is buying it. He said we can just sell mine and get some extra money."" I told her it's kind of ridiculous to ask her dad to buy her a brand new car when she has a perfectly good one and we don't need it anyways. She got upset and said it's not that big of a deal and her dad doesn't mind and that the car ""wasn't that expensive anyways."" She said I'm overreacting and that it's okay for her dad to do nice things for her. She got a brand new 2022 car completely paid for by her dad. And we sold her old one. 
Now, we are buying a new house. We've finally narrowed it down to two options. We were discussing it last week and my wife says ""oh I don't think house A is good my dad said he think we could do a lot better in our budget."" Before she talked to her dad, she LOVED House A. So, I got a bit frustrated and said it didn't matter what her dad thought because this is our family's home and he won't be living there. She got angry. We started arguing. We both said mean things. I called her a spoiled brat and said she needed to grow up and she got upset and slept in the guest room and has it's been a few days and we have barely spoken. She said I was ""so mean"" to her.




UPDATE: wow did not expect this to get so much traction. This was mostly a late night stream of consciousness and I realize I left a lot out, of course. I DID apologize to my wife for the name calling and we both agreed we have some issues to work through. Here's some more info for context and to answer some questions I've seen asked: 

1. We could have afforded the car on our own. We do well for ourselves. I was not worried about not being able to afford it. I just did not understand the rationale of buying a brand new car when you have a perfectly good one. Her old car wasn't even that old. It was a 2019 and had pretty much all of the same features her new one has. It didn't make sense to me. Also, we have a toddler and it's actually harder for her to get him in the new car than the old one. She also barely drives. I mean, seriously, the car sits in the garage 90% of the time. She has even said before that she hates driving. Sure it was free but I guess it's more about the principle than the car itself. But, she got what she wanted so whatever. 

2. We've been together 10 years - has it always been this  way? Why did I stay? --- valid points. And something I could dig deeper on. No answer right now other than I just fell in love and didn't want to leave. 

3. Do I have my own daddy issues? No, not really. My dad and I are fine. My parents are still married. We were very poor growing up and my parents were undocumented, and that was a very stressful way to live but my family made it work. I live on the other side of the country now so I don't see them as much but we talk and visit regularly. 

4. My father in law is a nice enough guy and for what it's worth, he also says his daughter is spoiled and has made comments throughout the years about it. Obviously I didn't need to call her a spoiled brat and I recognize the difference in her dad saying it and me but I am not the first person to say it to her. I KNOW THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT. 

5. I recognize I have my own issues due to poverty, trauma and all of that. I have been to individual therapy. That is a forever ongoing process. 

6. The house: All of the reasons my wife gave me are just matters of personal preference, like ""my dad says we need a bigger kitchen,"" ""my dad says we need a bigger backyard."" He is also convinced we will have more children even though we said we so not want anymore so he also said we need ""more rooms for more kids."" Nothing about safety of the house, the price, etc..just things he personally doesn't like or would have different in his home. Also we've been looking for over a year and he has given his thoughts many many times throughout the year. So, I'm not saying she shouldn't ask him for advice. Also, no, he would not be paying for any of the house. 

7. My wife has never been to any type of counseling in her life. When I suggested grief counseling for her after I started my own she looked at me like I said something ridiculous. Her family is very skeptical about therapy. So, I'm not sure if I will get her to do marriage counseling but we will talk about this further. 

8. Finally, my wife is a funny, creative, and beautiful woman. She's a great mom. She makes everyone laugh. I do love her despite what the post may make some of you believe.

Thanks to those who sent me thoughtful messages. They provided interesting perspectives. ALSO THIS NOT A FULL PICTURE OF EVERYTHING. I'M JUST NOT WILLING TO SPEND ANYMORE TIME WRITING IT. IT'S A LOT.",1
"Understand that my gf is on the spectrum while i am neurotypical at best.  Sometimes she does strange or questionable things that i cannot understand why she would do that. So i usually tend to question her on alot of the things she does and its something that i do with most people. And its usually pretty simple things like “why do you always carry so many things in your bag” “why would u walk over there instead of over here” “why are you doing this versus that”. There is zero judgement they’re just reflex questions. But she says that she feels like im criticizing her. But i dont understand why she doesnt just stand firm in whatever she’s doing. Its not like im saying what she’s doing is wrong im just wondering why she does what she does. 

Most of my friends and family would stand firm in whatever their doing and brush me off by either saying idk or because i want to. Since im questioning simple stuff. And ill accept that and move on. But my gf is convinced that im criticizing her. Aita?

P.S…Everyone thinks im a guy 😞. Im 21 f and my girlfriend is 20 f. We’ve been dating for 11 months. Im not your ex husband or ex boyfriend or an incel.

On other news thank you everyone for the feedback some are aggressive and some are so helpful. ❤️ Everyone mass downvotes my comments so im deleting them and just leaving the post up.",1
"I recently gave a previous coworker a reference and they got the job. I'm training them this week. I wanted to eat with my coworker at a nicer restaurant than we normally do, so we went to a Chili's.

We only get a 45 minute lunch break, and another coworker from a different building wanted to tag along. To save time me and the trainee ordered together online... But there is no dine in option. We figured we'd just choose carry out and then sit down with our other coworker.

When we came in the waitress sat us and asked what we wanted to drink. The trainee and I ordered water. The other coworker got a lemonade. When the waitress asked us if we were ready to order I explained two of us had ordered ahead and we wanted to sit down and eat with our friend.

The waitress looked at me like I had insulted her, so I tried to explain but my words definitely failed me, I said ""It isn't my fault the website doesn't let you choose dine-in"". She got pissed and ran into the backroom and yelled out angrily ""What's the name?"". A different person brought us the food and had us pay on the spot, noticing they seemed upset I decided to give a 22% tip which was the biggest you could give on the quick tip menu.

I can then hear the waitress very clearly from the backroom swearing about those two fucking guys ordered online and said ""It's not our fault dine-in isn't an option!"" She then ignores us and keeps going into the backroom to complain. At this point I asked my friends if what I'd done was super inappropriate, one of them said no and the other said it's not wrong but it's definitely weird.

We decided maybe she doesn't get a tip from online orders and decided to give a cash tip also. I tried to flag her down, as she is totally ignoring us now. She goes into the backroom again and I can hear her say ""Great now I have to serve these assholes."" I explain to my friends I simply cannot sit here and eat now, she's totally uncivil. My trainee had no problem with leaving early, and the other friend was a bit disappointed.

She comes over and tries to politely ask what we need, at this point I politely explain I didn't realize what we did was such a huge problem, I placed a 20 bill on the table as a tip and said me and the other guy who ordered online will leave. She acts like she doesn't know what's wrong.

I tipped 22% + 20 for a 20 dollar lunch.
AITA?

Okay, I'm the asshole and won't ever try to eat inside a restaurant without sitting down. I did try to make it right which I would've done if someone simply explained to me why it was wrong. I just wanted to eat chilis for lunch which I didn't have time for if I didn't order ahead.",1
"I (24 female), want to confront my Grandma (86) because, one, nearly every time I have conversation with my Grandma, she mentions my weight and it is the answer for everything. I'm tired after a long day at work? Wouldn't be if wasn't fat. And that goes for everything I might complain of.   
Not motivated to do a certain task? It's cause I'm fat.  
Am hungry? Woulnd't be if I wasn't fat.  
I'm in pain cause I lifted something heavy? Wouldn't be if I wasn't fat.  
  
And two, I have questions that burn on my soul, like why does she seem to favor my aunt over my dad?  
My aunt gets the money for a new car, wich wasn't necessary to get from a to b, and a very expensiv tour with a ship, wheras my dad had to pay his chare when my aunt, Grandma and he went the next year. Then my dad needed a new car 'cause it would have cost way more to repair the old one, withhout the garantie of succes, then to buy a new car and he needs it to get from a to be.  
My dad gets gifted about half the money needed but in the same breath my aunt also gets the ammount x that my dad got. Seemingly without a reason. And that was just one example of many more. And I don't understand why.  
  
And third, I want to ask her why she seems to hate my mom. I know my mom isn't always easy. She is a very direct woman, knows what she wants and how to get itand is often very busy, but is also the best mom I could ask for.   
Sweet, carring, loving, loyal and always there for me and the rest of the family.   
But every time my grandmy is with my mom, my mom gets criticized. Not direct, but through indirect comments like ""I would never cook this much/little food."" Or ""Seems like ironing clothes is your hobbie."" Or to my dad ""She (my mom) starred at me with cold eyes!""   
Funnily enough, it wasn't my mother staring at her with cold eyes, it was me. Because I had a long work day and I was tired and just wanted some time with my parents (not living with them anymore) and my grandma occupied my dad with something that, in my eyes, was unnecessary.  
  
My dad thinks I'm an A-hole if I do this because grandma suffers from dementia, but I feel like I need to ask this questions now, because I don't know how fast she is going to lose her memories and these questions have been burning on my mind for a few years.  
  
So: WIBTA?",1
"So last weekend I needed to go to the shop to get some food for a bit of lunch and dinner. I was also aware that one of the tires in my car was a bit flat and that my local petrol station had a free vend pump for filling tires. Great I thought. I can go round, fill my tire up and get some food. Two birds one stone.

So I drove up to the petrol station, parked in the free air parking spot, filled up my tire and went into the shop to quickly grab a baguette and a small lasagne. Probably took me around 5 minutes to stroll round and grab my bits.

As I leave the shop I discover that someone has parked behind me at the free air vend spot and has completely blocked my car in. They have clearly stretched the hose from the pump out and are filling their tires. Seeing this I think to myself that there is no need making a fuss and I just walk past the man to my car. I get in and just stick the radio on content to wait the few moments it will take for him to top up his tires. 

As I do I look into my rear mirror and see that an older gentleman has now approached the man filling his car and has said something to him. Something which seems to garner a response that involve several gestures to my car. I didn’t hear the conversation up I imagine it went something like this:

Older Gentleman: Hello sir, I want to inform you that the spot you have chosen to leave your vehicle is not actually considered valid and if you look closely you will see you have actually blocked that other car in.

Man With Car: I see your point sir but you see this clown parked his car here and then went into the shop denying access to this amenity for other vehicle owners

Maybe not exactly what was said but I suspect the general message wasn’t far off. After this conversation the older man walked off in a different direction and the man finished filling up his tire and left, allowing me to also leave. 

So that’s the story but let me provide a couple of added details. 
1. The petrol station in question operates a 1 way system where the air pumping spot is the last one before the exit, so if someone wanted to fill their tires and then call into the shop they would effectively have to leave the property and return. 
2. The air pump doesn’t specify anywhere that the user is only permitted to use the spot for the duration of the air pumping activity.

So I ask you the question, am I the asshole for pumping before purchasing? Is man with car the asshole for blocking the space I was parked in? Are we both the asshole? You decide.

Edit: I feel it is worth adding a small note addressing the apparent cultural differences here. Where I am from when you purchase fuel you have to pay for it after you fill the tank. As a result it is very common for a car to be left at the pump while the owner enters the shop to pay for the fuel and any purchases they make. So as a result of this being the case for fuel to me I don't believe it is totally unreasonable to apply the same logic or routine to air. That said through this thread I have learnt that this fuel culture is very different elsewhere.",1
"I (18MtF) posted on my Snap asking if anyone wants to see FNAF and got a reply from my friend (17F) inviting me to go with our friend group. I questioned why I wasn't invited in the first place, but looked past it.

She said I have to dress up as an animatronic like the rest of the group was and I was willing to cosplay but the only character left was Chica. I told her I'd do my best but asked if I could do Roxanne Wolf, as I would feel more myself and it'd be easier for me with her alt fashion. She said we were only going as characters from the first 2 games and listed who was dressing as who.

I decided to not give up and see if I could create a Chica cosplay in the little time I had. Unfortunately, finding the stuff I need was hard and it wouldn't arrive in time. She said I could just do face paint but I didn't want to go out in yellow face paint. I gave up and asked if I could instead go as mangle, but unfortunately, someone was already going as her, and it happens that they were originally going as Chica.

It became very clear that no one wanted to go as Chica so I figured it would be best if no one did. I mentioned that instead of making everything super specific, we should just dress as who we want and have fun. She said everyone else already has their costumes and they've been planning this for months. It was starting to feel like she didn't want me to go and saw me as an opportunity to have Chica in their group. I told her that she was being nitpicky and should be glad that I'm willing to dress up at all with only 2 days notice. 

She went off on me saying I can just not go and I was ""shitting on"" her idea that she's been planning for months. I told her that I wasn't shitting on her ideas and that it was impossible for me to make a Chica cosplay in time and that if she was planning this for months, she could have invited me a while ago, giving me time to make a cosplay as it's not like I hadn't shown interest in seeing FNAF. She made it seem like I was required to cosplay and then proceeded to not let me make minor changes.

I told her that if she's gonna invite someone last minute, she needs to allow minor changes. She ended up blowing up at me for ""insulting"" her instead of saying I didn't want to go. Things got out of hand when she brought up a bunch of irrelevant stuff that doesn't involve her and that she's tried to look past it only for me to ""shit talk"" her. She was vague but I have a general idea of what she referred to and it doesn't involve her and has since been worked out with those who were involved. She went as far as to bring up a middle school friend who I never even had a falling out with, we just became distant as we grew older.

This behavior really began to piss me off and I told her to go fuck herself and that I had no intentions on going to the movie anymore if she forces me to dress a certain way and decides to throw a fit, letting her know that her behavior was deplorable.",1
"My son, 16, was diagnosed with depression two years ago, and has since been going to therapy twice a week and put on medication. I share 50/50 split custody with his dad. 

A system his dad set up was buying eight two litre bottles a week for him to have in his room so he doesnt have to leave his room to drink. He will drink more than two litres a day, and his dad occasionally gets him energy drinks and such.

We have been doing this in my house, but bottled water is expensive. I have five other kids with my husband, its an unnecessary expense we could do without. Plus, you know, plastic in the ocean.

So, instead, I got him a large water bottle and told him to fill it up as needed from the tap. This led to the slightly sticky situation of my son filling it and trying to make it last him all week so he didnt have to refill. 

He was pretty lethargic all week, but thats not out of the ordinary. I assumed he was coming down and filling it up at night/while we were out, as he doesnt like his siblings all that much. Four y/o, three y/o and 18 mos triplets.

Monday he goes to his dads and tells him the new system. Ex called me, angry, called me an abusive mother. I explained cost, he said I should ""stop breeding"" and prioritise our son over the younger ones, who dont have mental health issues.

I apologised, but told him the plastic waste is unacceptable. If our son needs me to, I can fill the bottle. Ex is still incredibly angry, stating that his health should come first. 

I think he's being unreasonable, but I do understand his fear and anger to an extent, with the thingswe go through regarding our son. 

Son has stated he'll stay with his dad, skip my week, and he'll be back week after next. I think he's trying to guilt me. He was like it as a tot. If one of us upset him, he'd beg to stay with the other to make us feel bad and give in.

Am I being an asshole? I understand he lacks energy, but its not really an excuse. Like I said, I'm more than willing to help him if need be.",1
"Throwaway because she uses Reddit.

She wants to stay at mine for a day for ""recovery"" because it's far to travel in one day. 

The problem, is me and gf live in a one bed flat. 
I asked gf if she could stay a night with her mom, (a few miles away) so my mom won't have to stay at a hotel and can stay at mine. 

I won't ask my mom to sleep on the sofa with her bad back, so she can have the bed, and I will take the sofa.

"So I am very obviously using a throw away and I really suck at writing or making a coherent thought so I am sorry in advance. 

So how to put this in a way that makes sense, about 6 years ago my mom had an affair and is now married to the guy. Our dad has never really moved on and jokes that women his age (56) are ""too old, too ugly and too bitter"" for him to ever be in a relationship again. What he does do though is every Sunday he goes to either Outback or Texas Roadhouse and flirts with the bar tender and sits on his phone or reads a book. To me its so creepy and he could be on apps or actually trying to meet a new partner. 

Since it's Mother's Day (e.g. the biggest restaurant day of the year) I told him that it would be better if he stayed home today since he looks so weird sitting by himself at the bar of these restaurants. I even offered to pay for his door dash. I could tell that I really hurt his feelings but he said he didn't want to embarrass me and that was basically the end of our conversation.

Well my mom's husband tends to go all out for Mothers Day for us and his own kids (about 10 years younger than me and my brother) and I was really looking forward to it. When we arrived my brother asked me if I what I said to Dad was really true. I said yes but please let me explain my side of the story. My brother said there's no fucking side to explain--what I said was really shitty. My mom's husband tried to get in between us and my brother said you know what Eric, you're a fucking scum bag and I'm sick of pretending I respect you, much less like you. My mom then got so furious at my brother saying that Eric is a good man and my brother and his wife grabbed my niece and nephew and said that ""this bullshit charade is over."" My brothers wife even got in my mom's face and said that all of this hurt is your fault and that five years later she's not over it and she's happy to admit she will never forgive my mom as they were leaving. 

I tried to call my brother and he answered the first time and said that I hoped I enjoyed brunch I told him I can't enjoy it because mom and Eric are crying. He said do you think Dad cried when you told him he was too creepy for outback and hung up?  I tried to call him back and he said ""go give Eric a tissue and remind him that despite appearances and money he's a red-neck trailer park asshole who doesn't deserve respect."" I tried to call back one more time and this time my brother's wife answered said ""I'm trying to be yours sister but what you did was the biggest asshole move I've ever seen. Your dad is a great guy who didn't deserve what was done to him let him enjoy what he does"" and then she hung up. 


This thing got so ugly so fast I don't even know what happened. But since I've been called the asshole, AITA?",1
"I (33) have been with my wife “Taylor” (26) for 6 years.

I’m a construction worker, Taylor is a nursery practitioner, we’ve got an 18month old and 2month old so things are crazy, my wife does most childcare as obviously she’s got the childcare experience + breastfeeds, I do most housework like walking dogs, food prep and hoovering.

Now ever since I’ve known Taylor she’s been the type of person to hate spontaneous plans, she needs a weeks notice just to even like get her head around it - we usually plan things a month in advance.

Same for her weekends, she gets everything that needs doing on Friday (aside from anything child related) and refuses to do anything on the weekend, it’s her time; so if I want her to help me with anything or do anything she insists we have five days a week, since having children we rotate weekends so I get weekend a off and she gets weekend b off, date night is Friday.

It was my nieces 10th birthday and no babies were invited so I suggested wife stay at home with children and we’d do something together for my niece; a day at the zoo or circus.

I got to the party and realised I’d forgotten the cake + present so I texted my wife to bring the stuff; she did.

But she texted me; “Your nieces birthday is every year, the same time…I picked out the gift, I made the cake like seriously? Same fucking time each year I told you I didn’t want to do anything today”

She apologised that night said she was just stressed because eldest didn’t want to get in the car and it’s an hours drive. 

My family is on my side (except my mother) saying how excited my niece was to see my children and wife anyway, that as a parent you just “can’t not do anything” 

I’m just wondering if I’m TA? It seems everyone’s on my side (except wife who won’t talk about it and mother)

excuse my grammar.

AITA?",1
"My partner of 3 years & I are having a disagreement about this & she suggested posting it here to see what others think. We've been talking about marriage, & the logical choice of accommodation after that would be to move into her place, which is significantly closer to my workplace & in a much better neighbourhood. That is the one point we can agree on, but from there is where our opinions diverge.

She mentioned that if I moved in with her after marriage, she was expecting me to contribute fairly to the household, which meant paying half the monthly repayment (she considers it 'rent') for the place. To be fair, the monthly repayment is only 50% of the market rate, so I would only need to pay 25% in a way (correct me if I'm wrong), but I just don't want to. Our initial plan prior to this was to buy a place together prior to marriage, but (& I admit that this is my fault), I felt like she was pressuring me, so I didn't want to bother with viewings/ discussions until she made the (imo spiteful) decision to purchase this place. And now she was expecting me to contribute?

Her side is that she's always wanted to have her own place (she lived with her parents to save) whether on her own or with me, & since I didn't want to commit or give her a timeline for marriage, she was well within her rights to purchase whatever she wanted. My side is that I don't like being pressured, & would have agreed to purchase this place with her had she waited a bit more. In all honesty, I love the place she bought but am a little resentful that she made all the choices without consulting me. 

I told her that we would split utilities & groceries, but that was the extent of my contribution because anything more would just tell me she was being calculative. She said that if the roles were reversed, I would be expecting the same thing. Which, I suppose she's right, but again, she made this unilateral decision on her own without my input, so I don't think I should be held accountable for it.

So AITA?",1
"I (32m, white) am potentially in trouble at work, but I don't really think I deserve it.

My coworker, ""Anna"" (23-ish f, asian), is new at our office and she brings her own lunch on days we don't have a food truck. On Thursday (yesterday), she brought in a homemade stir fry and used our shared microwave in the break room to do it. I was in the room when she took it out of the microwave, and it smelled heavenly. I asked her about the recipe and she told me it was just a bunch of ingredients and spices thrown together as to not waste any veggies that might go bad soon. 

When I was telling her how good it smelled, I also mentioned that some other people at the office might think it would be too smelly or ethnic (as in, racist people tend to look down on ""ethnic"" things). I have read those kind of stories on here about microagressions when it comes to people of color and the food they bring in, and I wanted to warn her that she might not want to bring it in anymore so it doesn't happen to her. I emphasized that it smelled good to me personally, though.

I guess a couple of the other co-workers in the room overheard our conversation, because after Anna left the room, some of them sort of quietly told me how it was inappropriate for me to have said that. I told them that it's true, that ethnic food gets ridiculed for smelling too strong and that I disagreed with that senitment, but I also think she would face less harassment if she didn't bring in that food anymore. One of my other coworkers then said that ""I was the only one harassing her"" and making insinuations that her food is problematic, plus the fact that she hasn't even been bringing in her own food that often since she just started last week, so there couldn't have been an opportunity to have had this hypothetical harassment happen to her. I just wanted people, yes, even the assholes, at the office to make her feel welcomed.

I left work that day not thinking anything of it, until the following morning where I hear from a different coworker that Anna talked to our HR department about the conversation and how she was ""hurt"". I'm a bit frustrated as to why she didn't talk to me about it first since it was just a misunderstanding and that I'm looking out for her. I did notice that today she was trying to dodge me, which is unusual and a bit heartbreaking. I just want to work things out. I wanted to be a friend to her and help her out since this is one of her first jobs out of undergrad, but this has been blown of out proportion. Now my coworkers think I'm racist, but I really try my best to be an ally, but then again what do I know?

So, am I the asshole for telling her that her food might be a bit too much for other potentitally racist people in the office to handle?

EDIT: Some people have said to edit this post to add this: yes, I get it, I'm the asshole. What I said was really stupid. If it means anything to you guys, I remember entering the workforce as a young man shadowing assholes and I didn't know how to express how shitty I was treated since I thought it was normal to be treated a certain way or overhear certain things. I just thought she was a sweet girl who didn't deserve to see the nasty side of corporate life so quick, but I guess I ended up being like the guys that made my earlier career so god awful. 

Anyway I want to apologize to her in the most HR-friendly way this Tuesday. Hopefully she doesn't quit, but I also don't want to be the one that gets fired. Fingers crossed. Thank you for opening my eyes and I hope to do my due diligence to be a real ally.",1
"My partner and I have been together for two years. I have children too and his eldest daughter and my daughter are really good friends. However, my partner chooses to spend the time with his kids over Christmas with his ex instead of me. 

I want to include his kids and build a family with them too so as that's really important to me. I would love for him to spend time with me and them on Xmas morning for example and then the kids go back to their mum on Christmas afternoon. My kids happen to be with their dad on Christmas day this year and my partner is spending Christmas morning with his ex and kids at her house, leaving me completely on my own on Christmas morning. I just don't understand why we can't do something together with his kids too. They're not little, they are teenagers so I'm sure would understand. I have no other family nearby to spend time with either. Am i being unreasonable wanting him to bring his kids to my house for Christmas morning so we can all be a family rather than his spend Xmas morning ""as a family"" with his ex?",1
"Context: My family, (Mom (52f), Dad (54m), Me (30m), my sister Neza (27f), and my twin brothers Mark and Lucas (25m), grew up dirty poor. However, my parents always provided us with everything we needed and more. I would say we had a pretty good childhood, filled with love and care.  Somehow, they managed to put us for through college, stopping us from going into debt. Sadly, this means that their already hurt finances suffered even more. Out of the four of us, Neza´s tuition was the most expensive, since she decided she wanted to go to college out of the state. We all tried to talk her out of this, but she was adamant on 1.- Going out of the state and 2.- My parents paying for her. In 5 years of college, she never had a job.

About a year ago, my parents confided to me that they wanted to start saving up for their retirement, but they were unable to since they were still paying loans they took to pay for college and other expenses. I decided to tell my siblings and came up with a plan to give our parents an “alimony” (don´t know if this is the right word), for my parents to be able to save some money while staying on top of the bills.

All my siblings agreed to contribute to this “alimony” and I have written proof of that. I made the arrangements, set up the account and we started paying. Since I was the one that came up with the idea, I am paying 50% of the total amount, the twins pay 15% each and Neza pays the rest.

Neza hasn’t been paying what we agreed to almost since the beginning. She always has an excuse to not pay even tho we all know that she has the means to do it. Yesterday I went to collect the payment and I realized that Neza, again, had not made it and there was even money missing from the account. Not going to lie, I was furious, because my siblings and I made an agreement, and she was violating that. I send her a text message:

“This is the last time I talk to you about this. You have the moral obligation to contribute to our parent’s finances given that they are mostly ruined because of you. Make the payment or I will take you off the account and tell my parent the raised an ungreatful woman”.

She later called me screaming and yelling at me that I am not her father, and she can do with her money whatever she wants to. She said that our parents made the choice to pay for her college and she owes them nothing.

I told the twins what happened, and while they agree with me, they also said Neza was right. She does not owe our parents nothing, but would be nice of her to try and repay them. AITA?

EDIT: 1.-  Neza had a massive tantrum and threteaned to cut contact with my parents if they did not pay for her college. Everything she has now is because my parents chose to support her when they had no obligation to. 

2.- I did not force her to sign ANYTHING. We, as siblings, decided that paying a little alimony to our parents is nothing in comparison with what they did. We ALL agreed to this. ",1
"My mom and I went to a restaurant that was named after a primary colored crustacean. We both ordered shrimp and crab. Now maybe it's just because I spent so much time using my teeth like a multi tool but I always found they work better to open the crab than those little Crackers do. The Crackers work great for the big parts but for the smaller parts I use my teeth.

So anyhoozle I'm just sitting there gnawing on my crab legs when a family sits next to us. It was a man, woman, and a little girl. The woman seemed to take offense to me and told me that I wasn't behaving appropriately. I honestly didn't see the big deal. I was at my table opening my crab. She told me she didn't want her daughter to pick up my bad habits but I told her I wasn't going to stop.

"I 36F am married to Dan 34M. We have  discussed having kids in the future. I found out last year though that I have a low chance of naturally having a kid. 

Fertility treatments in my area are very pricey and my insurance only covers it after a certain time of trying naturally. I am pretty ‘old’ so my chance of naturally conceiving is low anyway, but I initially didn’t want kids, its only changed since meeting Dan. We saved up for a round of IVF but it was unsuccessful and a sore topic for the both of us. Dan wants to discuss it, but its something I struggle with.

My MIL is a lovely woman, but she can be invasive. My SIL had a miscarriage and my MIL was very helpful, staying with my SIL and helping out around the house but she has a fix it mentality and asked my SIL about trying again, adoption, fertility treatments pretty soon after. She didn’t mean it in a malicious way but I know if I told her she would have the same questions for me that I am not prepared to answer.

I initially told my MIL we both didn’t want kids but she kept asking me why. I told her Dan didn’t want kids actually
to get her to stop. 

She started asking Dan why and he is upset at me now because I lied to his mom.",1
Growing up I’ve been really insecure about my teeth. I’ve been bullied and ridiculed badly. I was a single mom for awhile and met an acquaintance now my husband and he bullied me for this when we were in HS. Please note that when he met me I was wearing my snap ons already for a year. He noticed it and asked me if I was wearing retainers and I kinda told him yes. So now that we got married 6 months later I finally told him and showed him and I guess he didn’t understood the best way that I could do since I’m really insecure about it. And ashamed and scared.. I was insulted when he told me I partly catfished him… I know it’s my 10% fault I didn’t explained clearly….,1
"This account is a throwaway. Please don't accuse me of trolling.

So I (M 16) have a Muslim family. And as such, my family would want to go to culturally relevant places. One of which was Pakistan. Now we'd been planning this for a LONG long time, and my parents were dead set on going. And admittedly? At the time, so was I. But then as they got the tickets, I realised that it was gonna eat into my time at Sixth Form. Some of which being my Maths Re-Sit exam. I told my parents, they'd already paid and they brushed it off as ""You can do your work there"" so I guess I became foolishly aloof with the idea. I go to sixth form, I absolutely adore it because I feel sixty times more free, and then holidays come up and we go to Pakistan. I voice the 'Exam Problem' again and they dismiss it, saying ""I've already paid so much for this. I'm not cancelling it for an exam.""

Now fast forward a couple weeks. I do IT so alot of my work is online. My parents tell me that I need to do my work on Teams, so I load up teams and BOOM! I can't access it. Because of the location, I can't access any of my work. This fucking annoys me alot. Now I'm gonna have a shit ton of work when I get back and I just have to fucking work with it. Seven weeks worth of work. Fuck fuck fuck.

My parents are talking about this. They do seem worried as well, but I'm not thinking straight, so I frustratingly say ""Well maybe we shouldn't have gone to this stupid trip in the first place. Not my fault, now I have to pull a whole bunch of stupid all nighters and I have to stay there longer, all for the goddamn price of sitting on a fucking motorcycle to see mountains.""

They go ballistic on me, telling me never to talk to them like that again, and that ever since I've been on this trip I've just been on my phone or a ""gloomy piece of shit."" they yell at me to go upstairs.

This issue is seething into the whole family now. Everyone seems to be against me, saying I should have never spoken to my parents like that. I've even had one to one talks with my grandfather, saying ""your parents should always be treated with respect"" and then some fucking parrabel about a dude who, in Islamic stories, was rude to his dad and was punished by Allah by being paralysed from the neck down. I don't fucking care. The dude in the parrabel was a dick for no reason. Im being perfectly fucking reasonable.

There are others who are on my side, like my distant relatives (who I really like hanging out with, period) who say my parents are being horrible by forcing me into this.

I think the root problem is that I swore at my parents. I think that's what set this all off. And to be honest, I do feel a bit bad but at the same time, how is any of this my fault???? I don't know. Just annoyed and frustrated. I have made friends at sixth form and all I want to do is hang out with them now.

Idk if this breaks any rules. Just really stressed and annoyed.

"I am the leader of my singing group. There’s quite a handful of us. A few of our songs have gotten very popular, and unfortunately, one of our members is trying to start a clothing brand, which is perfectly fine. However, it’s taking away from her motivation towards our group, and four of us collectively, decided that it would be best if she was removed from the group. She was a fantastic singer and performer, but I am the vocalist of our group, so I felt like we didn’t need her because I could already sing her parts. she was notified yesterday that she was removed from the group, and she said that she felt completely heartbroken and betrayed by us. Not all of us wanted her gone, some stayed neutral, and some voted to keep her in. We all make decisions as a group and majority wins, and the majority voted to kick her out.",1
"I(35M) am a very cheerful person by nature. I went through alot of shit in life, and I struggled alot, but throughout it all, I managed to keep an even temperament. I am an optimist by nature, and I always try to maintain a cheerful and bright outlook on life.

My wife(34F) is the opposite. She tends to get angry easily, and is more cynical and jaded than me. We get along well for the most part, but she tends to always predict the worst. She always thinks about things that could go wrong, and never really appreciates what we have.

The problem is, as my kids are growing up, they are getting imbibed with her energy. They are starting to become incredibly cynical, with dour pronouncements on employment and the economy, constantly trying to bring up incredibly depressing news. They seem to enjoy talking about corruption, and downfall, and the bad things about our life, and society in general.

I read about some scientist who discovered that if you move your face into a smile, like hold that expression, that muscle movement actually has an impact on your mood, and you become happier. sLast month, I decided to put this in practice. For every single negative or depressing thing they say, I take away a dollar from my kids' allowances They begrudgingly went along with it at first, but now they are getting really annoyed at me, and everyone is calling me an AH for this.

"My husband and I have been together for 4 years. I have two kids (17m /19f). and their half brother is 3 years old.



this past week. My husband had an emergency (dad had a medical emergency) and wanted someone to watch our son. he asked my older son and he refused because he was going out with friends. he also asked my daughter but she locked herself in her room to study. I was at the restaurant with my brother meeting his girlfriend for the first time. My husband ended up taking our son with him to the hospital and his mom watched him from there.


He came home and was lashing out on everybody. Calling us selfish and unfeeling. I tried to explain that the kids were busy but he told me to get the f out with that bull because my older son could've skipped the hangout and watched his brother and, my daughter could've watched her brother while studying instead of locking herself in her room. He scolded me as well but I told him I couldn't leave lunch with my brother since he was visiting town and this was my only chance to meet his girlfriend.

He yelled some more than told us that he was canceling the family holiday trip for christmas this year. The two older kids were upset and said it was unfair. I called him unreasonable to cancel the trip and punish the kids (and possibly me) like that. he refused to discuss it later. Now me and the kids aren't speaking to him and he's saying ""good riddance""


*edit My husband was supposed to watch our son at the time. That's why I went to see my brother at the restaurant. The kids aren't used to watching their brother when neither parent is home.*


*update My husband just told us that he'll be spending christmas with his family saying he needs to be around his dad anyway. the kids said they will just go to their dad since they and my husband are still not talking. neither of the kids are happy with how things turned out. so I feel like things have gotten out of hand and the problem got bigger. He's now choosing to basically abandon us on christmas and also keep our son away from me and his siblings.*",1
"My boyfriend has had trouble with his skin for a long time. In particular, shaving leaves his skin severely irritated. When I met him, he had a very rough beard, which he said he kept to avoid shaving. About a year ago he started a white-collar job which meant he had to shave it off. Since then shaving has been a pretty bad experience for him. Every morning he goes to work with a very bad red neck and face. He started to shave in the shower at my direction and that helps a little, but it’s still pretty bad. 

A few months ago, his birthday was coming up. I am really bad at buying presents, and was pumped when I thought I had figured out the perfect present. I had done some research and bought him exfoliate, a razor for sensitive skin and some other shaving-relating products to round it all out. I was excited to finally be proud of a present I got for him.

His birthday was last week, and it turns out exfoliating and this new razor doesn’t entirely fix his issues, but helps immensely. He was absolutely ecstatic and said it was the best present he had ever received, and he felt he could finally move past the discomfort and embarrassment of having inflamed skin every day.

While he was thanking me, I told him that I had been holding onto that present for three months and had been dying to give it to him the whole time, and that at times I had almost broken and given it to him early. Upon hearing I had it for months, he suddenly turned.

He has been furious with me the last week and we just can’t agree on who is at fault here – our friends/family are equally split so I’m interested to hear Reddit’s take. 

His perspective is that I have been allowing him to suffer for my own benefit. He seems particularly mad about that fact that every morning he complains about his skin and for three months I’ve had the “option to fix it” and decided not to so I could maximise my own gratification. He thinks it’s the equivalent of if I had, for example, terrible back pains and he stumbled on a pill that would fix it, bought it and then decided to wait three months to give it to me while watching me suffer every day.

I think that’s a pretty big exaggeration. I do see where he is coming from, but I feel like he is being very ungrateful for a well thought out present. I just wanted to bring him happiness on his birthday and didn’t feel like it was so serious that waiting was immoral. He is so difficult to buy presents for, and I had finally figured something out and if I gave it to him early I’d be left at square one and faced with the likelihood of disappointing him.

"My husband (42) and I (37) have our 10 year wedding anniversary coming up soon. This has been a long year for both of us as i was diagnosed with cancer and have been dealing with the treatments for the past year and have finally been declared cancer free. During the treatment my husband has been amazing and has used almost all of his vacation time to make sure that I was being taken care of, of course this meant that he doesn't have any time to take a week off for our upcoming 10 year wedding anniversary to go do something fun. I of course still wanted to celebrate being cancer free so I booked a tropical getaway trip with on of my best friends so I could get away and celebrate.

Due to the scheduling of my friend the only time that worked best for her was during the same time that my wedding anniversary falls on. I figured this would be fine since my husband couldn't take any time off to go anywhere anyway. I told my husband that I was taking the trip after everything had been booked and he ended up getting very upset and saying that taking the trip on our anniversary date and not discussing any of the plans with him prior to booking everything made him feel like he didn't matter. Of course this is not true, I still love him but I really wanted to get away and have some time to have fun again.

I told him that once he has some vacation time saved again that he can book us a trip and we could enjoy some tropical time together then. I really didn't want him to feel like he wasn't allowed to do anything fun. 

AITA for planning a trip with my friend on my wedding anniversary date and not informing my husband until after everything was booked?

Edit:  I understand from the comments that I was being insensitive, the timing with my friend is that she really wanted to get away from the cold weather and do something warm before her job picks back up in the summer. I understand that my husband is s upset and I will talk to him later and let him choose anything that he wants us to do together after I get back, just to let him know that he is still important to me.

Edit:  I had to take some time to reflect on the messages and replies that I got. Some were very hurtful, which is fair.

To answer a few questions brought up. I do have a job and was able to work reduced hours while using my sick days for appointments and the surgery/ recovery. My husband's work would not allow for him to use his sick time for this so he had to use his vacation days.

The cancer I had thankfully wasn't as severe as some people's family members here. But it still took many appointments, a surgery to remove most of it plus lymph nodes and then the resulting radiation therapy and follow up appointments.

I have decided that I would push back the trip and leave the day after our anniversary so my husband and I can spend our anniversary together. I did apologize to my husband for booking the trip without talking about it with him first. He has had no issues with me taking time to spend with my friends in the past and I honestly didn't think he would mind that much. 

My friend is obviously upset with this as she has to reschedule her days off as well as parts of the trip that she contributed to, but I hope she understands the situation.

I want everyone to know that I really wasn't trying to be the biggest asshole on the planet, this has been a very stressful time and im just trying to keep everyone happy as I care about everyone in my life.

Edit:  I  can't believe that this topic is still getting attention.  I should probably note that I did go on the trip and I  made sure to email my husband every day to let him know that I was safe and that I love him. I don't think that he was mad about it, he seemed happy to see me when he pick me up at the airport.  Overall  I think everything worked out in the end. So I may be the asshole, but that is now in the past and we can move on with our lives.",1
"Yeah it sounds bad but it really was an innocent thing. I was at a cookout with my wife's family and I just opened up a cold one. My wife's three year old neice asked me what I was drinking, and I told her it was beer. She asked to taste it, so I poured her like a tenth of a sip into a plastic cup thinking it will be bitter for her, but, well, she liked it.

She wanted more and I told her it was a grownup drink but it was too late. She ran around demanding to drink more beer for the entire cookout, she wouldn't eat anything, just demanded beer, and they had to put her in a time out.

Anyway, the inlaws are mad now and the wife isn't happy. So AITA?

Edit: the kids are given watered down wine on  shabbas if it's relevant

Update: apologised and sorted it out with the in laws. They know I love that little rascal and would never intend to harm her. I do agree with people that things like that should be leveled with the parents first. Interesting that the divide along YTA/NTA was highly correlated with upbringing - Europeans and more rural oriented Americans (for lack of better wording) did realise that this a just a dumb brain fart on my part at worst, and just being an uncle at best. 
I think mostly Americans were highly critical of my actions, there does seem to be a series taboo regarding alcohol and boundaries in that culture. I guess its a matter of outlook, as most things are.

Having said that, I got some literal death threats, and some people said I should be locked up and never ever be around children. Really now?",1
"My wife and I [30s] recently had our first child, a girl. My wife is a BIPOC, I am white, we are in the US.

Our rules around our daughter boil down to trying to raise a biracial daughter in a supportive environment:

* Stick to positives/words of affirmation. We don’t want her internalizing things like being called silly for doing normal baby things. 

* Avoid names/terms with racist connotations. ""monkey” is not on the table, regardless of context. **Edit: like I said, monkey as a name/descriptor for her isn't allowed. The no context threw people off- yes, you can point at a monkey and say ""look, a monkey"". Comparing her to one is what we're not allowing.** 

* No excessive pressure to ""perform"". If she doesn't want to smile, that's fine. If she's at the cusp of a milestone, let her achieve it organically. Cheering, but no pushing.  

I also requested that my parents [50s, divorced] read a book or two about raising BIPOC children, or about racism in the US in general. I read these books as well. I try and make all requests sensitively, as well as any rule reminders.

My mom's reception to the books was a bit flat, but she did (as far as I know) read a book or two. We did have to sit down once just to review the rules (neutral location, after an activity, ""shit sandwich"" approach of compliment, concern, compliment). As an adult I’ve realized she’s the guilt-trip/passive-aggressive type of parent/person.

My wife's parents have not been an issue on these fronts.

My dad recently visited while she did her first good solid standing during his visit (organically), and was right at the cusp of taking steps unsupported. Videos/photos were sent to family. 

My mom came yesterday. From the start she went hard on “walk to grandma!”. We redirected- move to her play area, walk to my wife or I, etc. My mom continued, and my daughter eventually took her first steps towards my mom. After the visit my wife and I talked. We were unhappy because it was coerced so strongly and almost felt purposeful. Like my mom was on a mission. Note: wife's parents there for first good crawl, my dad just here for solid standing. I'm sure there was a bit of a sting over our daughter walking towards my mom as well though.

So I texted my mom to re-iterate that we want our daughter to hit her milestones organically. My mom's response felt a bit flat, so I added ""because honestly we felt a bit robbed by what you did, and don't want it to happen again"". My mom's response was:

* It wasn't her intention, it was just her reaction to our daughter's standing
* She feels like she's under constant scrutiny
* She barely gets to see our daughter
* Maybe she should just stay away for everyone's sake.

I just responded with ""I'm sorry you feel that way, we still would love to see you at [planned get together]"" Which I know isn't an actual apology.

So, AITA for having rules about my daughter? AITA because I responded flatly to my mom's (manipulative?) response? AITA for feeling ""robbed"" by the coercion to walk to grandma (vs even just walk in general)?

Edit: I've set up a call to chat with my mom to clear the air, and see whether there's a way forward. I've absolutely taken to heart everyone's comments, and I've tried to respond to some of them. There's more nuance than I could include, but at the end of the day the YTA are rolling in without stop, so I'm examining my parenting and everything, and working to improve.

Edit 2: I lost the comment, but someone asked if I was really learning from this, because I was only responding to the N T A or N A H comments. Ironically I guess I wanted to start in a safe space, and take baby steps. I think some of the nuance and context was lost in translation, and those comments I think either picked up on that, or again just felt like a safe place to start with my learning/change. **BUT BUT BIG BUT** That has not stopped me from re-evaluating myself, the situation, our rules, etc. I also get how red-herring the whole books on racism thing sounded, since it didn't apply to this direct situation. For the people that asked: yes, my dad read them, and his response was much more engaged and accepting, which may have affected my perception of my mom's response (My dad and my relationship with him is a whole different story, and something I'm going to include in my therapy as well). I get that some people think it's over the top, but 2020 taught me a lot about myself and where I was in my development with acknowledging racism and my own white fragility, and where my parents were. It was necessary. My in-laws were not ""assigned"" reading about racism, though books specifically on biracial (black and white) children could be helpful. 

So, if anyone cares:

* I'm setting up a consult with a counselor/therapist, because I need to work through my relationship with my mom in the short term, and my anxiety and controlling behaviors in the longer term. I see these behaviors in myself, and I want to correct them. I don't know how my mother-son relationship is going to go, but we want to foster the grandaughter-grandmother relationship if we can.  

* We are making sure there is nuance to the rules- I think this part was lost, but the ""silly rule"" was just that we didn't want that as her term of endearment. Maybe that's still too controlling on its own, but we totally agree that a toddler acting funny/goofy/silly gets to be called silly. She can want to be silly, etc. The monkey thing was also not a/r/birdsarentreal thing, but we're trying to figure out a more nuanced approach- because at some point, it's likely she will completely and innocently, as a child, want to play like a monkey, and we don't want to shut down that creativity. 

* On that note, I also don't want to be a helicopter parent or bulldozer parent. We're working to make sure that we create a safe place, not a bubble. We don't want our daughter to be treated as/internalize fragility, and she'll need to be able to deal with life's challenges on her own.",1
"I 28M have a sister 30F who is in the National Guard, and 2 months ago, she came up to me to ask if I could watch her dog over a deployment that would last about a year. She originally wasn't going on it, but some of her unit got in a car accident that resulted in 2 dying and the other being medically discharged, so she now has to go. Now for the asking, I could have theoretically taken her dog and helped her out, I have a dog, and I know it wouldve taken some work to get them into a pack kind of situation but quite frankly I didn't want too. I have the time, but I just didn't, and that should be a valid reason all on its own. So my sister rehomed her dog and told my family about it. Nobody is really mad at me, but they say overall it's just not a great situation. So it's been about a month, and my sister is now deployed and was talking about it in our family chat but still upset over it. I tried to tell her it's ok and that her pup is in a better place and we'll be taken care of by her new people. She got quiet, and the family chat moved on. My dad kinda did a yikes face, and after we concluded, he told me that what I said wasn't ok. It wasn't fair for me to do that because it's not my fault for not wanting another dog temporarily, but family helps family, and realistically, I had no place to say what I did. He said I'm not allowed to speak about pet ownership in the chat and called me an asshole. My mate told me to post on here because I'm unsure what I did wrong, and he wants to ""show me what reasonable people think,"" so reddit

Basically my daughter(13) gets really bad periods the same as her mother, which I’m very knowledgeable about i grew up with 6 sisters and have been with my wife for nearly 18 years. But the thing is I think she is taking advantage of our son. My daughter has him running to the fridge for her, grabbing everything for her, even adjusting the tv volume and the led lights. It makes me glad that he wants to help her but he cannot do everything for her. When I brought this up to my son my wife became very angry at me and said I was going to discourage our son and o should be proud he’s learning early.

I said although I am proud, I feel he’s being taken advantage of. He can help grab things for her if he wishes but going so far to adjust ac, the tv volume, getting up at her every call is a bit far. She got angry at me and told me I’d never understand and that I was going to ruin our sons helpful mindset. I’m just trying to help I feel though he’s being taken advantage. AITA?",1

My GF and I got take out from an Indian restaurant we like and order from usually when our budget allows us. This place is really the only good Indian place anywhere near us  but it is very pricey, and so we try to keep our order small (1 entree for me, 1 entree for her, and a side of naan bread that we share). The thing is, the side of bread isnt very much, and the entree just isnt the same without it. So it seriously annoys me when she eats the bread without dipping it in her curry. Its such a waste of the little bread that we get. I told her this before but says its not my concern how she eats her food. Except it is my concern because she is wasting a SHARED side. Whatever, I let it go each time. 

This time she didnt order curry like she usually does, she got biryani (rice and meat) so I was happy that I would get the bread to myself. While we were eating, she reaches over for the bread and eats a piece on its own. I got annoyed and moved the bread away from her and told her she doesnt need the bread  since she isnt eating a curry and doesnt need bread whereas I am eating a curry so I do need bread, also that her entree comes with rice and she can eat that. She got offended and ended up threatening not to pay her share for the food next time. She also called me a greedy asshole and took her food and ate the rest in our bedroom.

My friends are split, one of them says I'm in the right and it's too much carbs for one meal for her to have bread and rice, but the  other friend essentially also called me a greedy asshole. Its been hours and she's ignoring me. AITA?",1
"My son is 26 with a beautiful 8 year old daughter. He and his ex girlfriend were both 18 when she came around, and she was definitely a little surprise.
Despite the circumstances, my son really stepped up. He got a good job and eventually got them a nice apartment.
They were together for almost three years, but she just wasn't ready to be a mother, and she ran away with some other boy. She wasn't a bad girl, she just wasn't prepared to be an adult. This devistated my son, but he found his feet. My granddaughter was still very young, so she never had strong memories of her mom.
He's been a single father since then, and it's still a sore spot for him.

Yesterday my son comes by my house incredibly upset saying that his ex girlfriend came to see them. She said she was sorry for leaving like she did and just wanted to see him and her daughter. 
My son said he told her not to come back and shut the door on her. He was practically in tears telling me this.
I told him he needed to calm down and act like an adult about this. She wasn't asking for anything but to talk, and the least he could do was hear her out. I tried to tell him that he couldn't refuse his daughter a chance to connect with her mom, how good this could be for all of them. But he was a complete mess, he couldn't even talk to me, just stormed out. I've called, but he won't answer.

I understand how hard this is for him, but this isn't some evil, malicious woman, and it sounds like she's coming from a place of real remorse. I'm was just trying to help him think clearly, but it feels like he just won't be rational here and it's starting to affect his and his daughters life.",1
"I woke up at 5am craving pancakes while on vacation with my in-laws, so I decided to quickly make myself and my son some since we were the only ones awake besides my husband who doesn’t eat pancakes. My sister-in-law’s daughter came downstairs just as my son was finishing up and started crying because there were no more pancakes for her. 

I did try to comfort her but I have really bad morning sickness after I eat and I was starting to feel sick so I had to take her to her parents who were still sleeping.

Long story short my sister-in-law was upset I only made pancakes for myself and my son when there were others in the house who also needed to eat breakfast. She said I was selfish and I should’ve known my niece would’ve wanted some too so I could’ve made extra just in case.

"One of my wife's best friends is getting married next month to her long time partner. While I personally don't have a problem with this, my family does.

Ordinarily this would not be a problem, but since my wife is in the wedding party, I am concerned about photos being taken of me and of me being tagged on social media and my family being able to see it. If this gets seen, I am going to get a lot of grief and questions from my family which I don't want to deal with. 

Of course my wife expects me to go even though I have explained to her this is going to open up a lot of uncomfortable family conversations which she won't have to deal with but I will. I am at the point now where I have to make a decision since my wife is not giving me an easy out. 

I know that this may be the cowardly approach, but I have considered skipping the wedding and lying and saying I came down with the flu. I do not know if my wife would lie on my behalf, but we'll see.

WIBTA for skipping in order not to complicate things with my family?",1
"
I (29f) have a friend called “Maya”. Maya and I have been friends for nine years, after meeting at university. 

Maya went through a lot of mental health issues in her early-mid 20s which impacted her career prospects, but a couple of years ago she found an outlet in writing, and now writes and publishes her stories online. They are of the “spicy romance” variety. I’ve never read any of them because they’re just not my thing but I know she has a lot of regular readers. 

Recently, Maya shared that she had been contacted by a small publishing company which publishes ebooks who were interested in publishing one of the stories she had been sharing online. I was ecstatic for her, as it is a move towards making writing a profession, which is what she really wants. 

About three weeks ago, a mutual friend of ours “Amy”, contacted me and asked if I had read any of Maya’s current story as she had looked it up online and she thought it had some eerie similarities to my life. I looked it up and read a big chunk of it, and it was more than just similarities, it was basically a melodramatic reimagining of my life, specifically about my relationship with my fiancé, and my complicated relationship with my father. Idk how relevant this is but she also altered their characters and certain situations to make the “plot” pretty toxic. 

I was devastated and disgusted to say the least. I met up with Maya and asked how she could do this to me. Her explanation was that she was so inspired by my life and the things I’d told her that the ideas just came to her. I kept saying they weren’t her ideas, they were sensationalised details of my real life, she didn’t have a single original thought in the whole story. Maya apologised profusely for hurting me and that she was embarrassed by how much she had taken from life but she really loved writing the book. I told her I wasn’t comfortable having my private life aired like that. Maya said nothing in the book was identifiable as me so it wasn’t like she’d done anything illegal, and I said, well we’ll see about that.

I’ve contacted lawyers and they’ve said suing her would be largely pointless in terms of stopping the book being published, but starting legal proceedings might scare a small publishing company enough to drop her as an author. I am seriously considering doing this. Worst case, I can’t do anything to stop the book going ahead but I’ve caused her an iota of the stress and hurt she’s caused me. Best case, this creepy project never sees the light of day.

A couple of my friends are saying I shouldn’t sue her, because at the end of the day this is her work and an opportunity for her to make a career for herself and take her of her child, after all she’s been through. I know this could ruin things for her and I might be acting out of anger but I really think it’s justified after she betrayed my trust like this. WIBTA to go ahead with suing?

Edit/update: 

For everyone talking about the Streisand effect - I am not in the US. Court/legal records here are not something you can Google or access easily. 

That being said, I realise Maya could publicise a lawsuit herself to get publicity, and that ultimately I am more concerned about anonymity and it’s not worth the risk. 

I will not be proceeding with the lawsuit. Some people suggested reaching out to the publisher privately, and I’m going to look into that. But either way I won’t drag it out into a court process. ",1
"

alright this is my first time posting but i really need some outsider advice because my friends are all bias to one side or the other. I (f17) have been talking to a boy recently, call him M (m17), i have a friend lets call her K (f16) who went out with him like 2 years ago for like 5 weeks. K now has a new boyfriend who she is happy with so i thought it would be ok for me to ask her if she was ok with me talking to M and she started ranting to me about everything bad he did to her and how much he hurt her which i understand but everything she listed just made it sound like a one sided relationship not a horrible manipulative one like she made it out to be (not inviting her over, treating her more like a friend etc) and she literally ended a friendship over this boy in the past because a mutual friend started talking to him after they broke up. i love K to pieces and shes one of my dearest friends but i dont think its fair for her to dictate who i can and cant be romantically interested in especially since they only went out for a month. i tried to ask my best friend for advice but she doesnt like K very much due to past experiences, and any other friend i ask would be on K's side because of 'girl code'.

 would i be the ahole if i went out with him even though she said she didnt want me to? 

-feel like it might also be important to mention i had a thing with M before her but we never officially dated.",1
"I (24M) work in a small business, and most of my coworkers are acquaintences or friends outside of work. Recently there has been conflict between two of my coworkers, A (24F) and P (25M). I'd like to preface this post by saying that I am not close with either A or P, but share seperate mutual friends with both of them, so I'm friendly with both.

From other coworkers, I have heard that the conflict started when A, supposedly reported P to the manager for ""harrassment"" of a trainee. I don't know the full story, so I have continued to remain cordial to both, though I do admit that I have maintained a relationship with P outside of work, due to our mutual friends.

I have heard recently from some coworkers that this has upset A and rumours have been spread about me (which I believe to have come from A, despite our coworkers telling me otherwise), causing the work environment to be tense. 

A's and my mutual friends have been questioning and confronting me outside of work due to my continued association with P. P has explained to me that A refuses to see his side of the story and she has publically released their private conversations on social media. I told A that this was immature and rude, especially given the fact that P told me he was just trying to have a civil conversation. 

 I feel as if I am not in the wrong, as I do not know the full extent of the situation, but my friends tell me that I should support A because she is now facing ""harrassment"" from P. Again, I am unsure if this is true, as I do not know all the information. 

Now my friends are cutting contact with me and my coworkers are behaving cold towards me, makin me question if I'm in the wrong. So, AITA?",1
"I'm the VP of Sales at a software company and one of our sales development reps parents passed away at the beginning of April, sadly they were involved in a car crash and both lost their lives. Now the employee in question in very young 22 year old guy and has been with us for about 10 months now. He's a great employee and we were thinking about promotions in the next \~6 months for him. His job is a high paying one for a new grad, about \~90k with commission and base so we expect a lot from this position. Because of the accident we let him take a 1 month paid leave of absence from work and he's returned a few weeks ago and his performance is severely lacking. He's super unmotivated, not cold calling, out reaching to prospects for the last 2-3 weeks enough since he's come back. Our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long.

We called him into a meeting on Friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. Told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. I thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

I told my boyfriend about all of this and he said myself and my mgmt team are a bunch of asses and pricks with no hearts.

Holy fuck this blew up, I know this was shitty of me now. And I reached out to him to see how he's holding up. He's staying at his gf's place and she's supporting him a lot right now. I offered to get my head hunter friend in touch with him when he's ready and he accepted.",1
"Brief history- my husband has a daughter, ""Edith"" (27F) from his first marriage. He divorced his ex when Edith was 7, but she apparently had a hard time with the split, and moving houses, etc. He and I met and married when Edith was 10. Together, we now have ""Cecilee"" (15F) and ""Peter"" (10M). 

&#x200B;

Edith has always been aloof with our children. She was never particularly interested in them, although both kids, Cecilee especially, would've loved a closer relationship with her. I did bring up to my husband a few times that I was worried about Edith not being closer to her siblings. He responded that her ambivalence was better than he expected, given how hard she took the divorce, and he did not want to rock the boat. I was not happy with this but I let it rest. He and Edith are pretty close, but she barely speaks to me, Cecilee or Peter.

&#x200B;

Cecilee has mostly gotten over her desire to be close to Edith. I used to see her perk up when she saw her at family functions a few years ago, making a point to sit close to her, or talk to her. She does not do that anymore, and is polite but not super eager when we see Edith now.

&#x200B;

So to the current situation- Cecilee recently discovered a tik tok account of Edith's cousin. Apparently Edith has her sleepover in her condo (she lives in a big, ""fun"" city), and they go to events. They seem to be very close. This opened up a whole lot of feelings for Cecilee and she got upset and responded to the video saying ""That's my sister. And she barely talks to me"". 

&#x200B;

Literally, that's all she said. But she got quite a response with people giving opinions for both sides. Apparently, someone figured out Edith's instagram, and were sending her harassing messages. I definitely feel awful about that. However, I refused to reprimand or punish my daughter. She only said the truth. My husband is upset as Edith skipped thanksgiving at our place this year, and he thinks punishing Cecilee will help his and Edith's relationship.

So AITA?

"My mom and I went out to a hot pot restaurant. She had been a bit tired but was still ok. But a few minutes after we had been there, she lost her temper at 2 waiter who asked her multiple times if they could take her empty plates. She shouted “No, please just leave me alone”. But right after, she was fine and pretended nothing had happened. I really hate when people throw temper tantrums but I didn’t want to cause a fight so I kept quiet and gave her a cold shoulder. She the began to yell at me, saying that I wasn’t taking her side and siding with a stranger against her, I told her I wasn’t siding with anyone and that she could have handled the situation better. She then said I was “embarrassed and shaming her” and causing a fuss over nothing. AITA here? ",1
"My friend Alissa is getting married in a few months and I'm the Maid of Honor planning her bachelorette trip.

I am in a group chat with all of her friends (Alissa is not in this group) so I can plan stuff. At the beginning of the month, I asked the girls to send me their payments for the airbnb by the end of the month. Some have sent theirs, others not yet but I'm taking care of it. I forward all the payments to Alissa since she is booking the airbnb and then the rest of us are paying for the rest of the trip.

Alissa messaged me a few days ago asking if there was anyone else who was planning to send their payments, as we were waiting on a few more girls. I didn't respond to her because I would take care of it.

Today she messaged me with an update saying she reached out to the remaining girls and told me when they were planning to send it. I felt a bit hurt that she went behind my back to take care of it as I'm the one planning it, and it made me feel like she thinks I can't plan the trip. 

I told her to back off and asked her why she doesn't trust me, and told her to stay out of the planning. She got offended and told me that I'm taking it too personally and that it's her bachelorette and she's allowed to text her own friends. Now it's a been awkward and tense between us.

My mom told me I was rude and aggressive for telling her to back off, but I feel like I'm a bit justified. Imagine being told to do a job and someone just does it for you. It makes you wonder if they think you're incompetent.

"So my friend from high school is getting married soon. She's one of those girls who's been planning her wedding forever, and she's been actively planning this for well over a year. Her fiance is a great guy and I'm very happy for them. But it's been really difficult for me to justify going.

For one thing it's out of state, and all I've done over the last four months is watch ticket prices skyrocket. I finally bought my ticket down there because I couldn't stand to watch it go up anymore, and now I'm trying to figure out how to get back for less than the cost of my soul. I'm in grad school and I'm a freelancer so I don't make a whole lot, and my parents have made it explicitly clear they will not be contributing to this little adventure.

On top of that, I can't eat the food they're serving at the reception due to strict religious dietary restrictions. My friend has been going out of her way to find me something to eat, and even if she succeeds, I'd still feel weird getting my own special little triple wrapped meal while everyone else is fine dining. I'd rather just buy a protein shake on the way and play the ""I'm not hungry"" card to strangers.

Speaking of strangers, I will know no one there. I don't even think I've ever met the bride's parents (if I have it was ten years ago and I have no recollection). The only person I'll know is the only other friend she kept from high school, a girl who used to bully me, and who's in the bridal party so even if I want to catch up with her, she'll be busy the whole night.

I can't afford a hotel so I'll either be playing the 24-hour-round-trip game or renting a car and sleeping in there for the night so I can save money on Ubers, too. I also am very uncomfortable in formal attire so not only do I have to figure out how to match the vibe and formality, I also have to actually purchase something to wear. And I haven't even touched the registry yet, so add on a gift and we're nearing $600.

Would she *really* notice if I wasn't there? Almost definitely not. But the truth is I'm one of two friends she's kept around since high school, she's been talking to me about this wedding for ages, I care about her a lot, and she's put a lot of effort into making it possible and comfortable for me to attend. I appreciate her so much. When I asked her to send me pictures of the types of outfits I should be looking for so I could match the vibe, she started googling plus size dresses that she thought would look good on me so I didn't have to do the shopping. Was it helpful? No. But it's so sweet that she tried. And more selfishly, I just don't have a lot of friends. This is the first wedding I've been invited to and in the least depressing way possible, it might be one of the last. It feels wrong not to go to support my friend on her big day, but I know how I am and I know I'm gonna be miserable the entire time. My parents think it's a waste of time and money and it's getting really difficult for me to disagree. So WIBTA?",1
"Backstory: to put it lightly, my MIL has said in the past that she thinks people take advantage of her/use her for money. We have mostly smoothed over the relationship since then, but I would never allow her to do something extravagant for us because of what she said. 

This will writing session with a lawyer is the first “big” gift she’s (attempted) to buy for us($500ish), and I have repeatedly told my husband “no.” 

Now, I need to address that this conversation has only happened between husband and MIL. She has never directly asked me if I want this. I recognize there’s an issue there. 

I thought we had nipped it in the bud back in January when we politely declined, but apparently she tried to arrange for us to do it by zoom this morning while she plays with our son (whose birth kicked off this whole thing). I told my husband I still felt that we shouldn’t accept this gift from her and that I’m now feeling weird about the fact that she keeps pushing the matter. And that I didn’t like that she went to him and he agreed to it after we had already talked about it. 

My husband is really distraught over being caught in the middle. He just told her she’s still welcome to come over but we are not ready to do this and need to be allowed to do it by ourselves and she chewed him out and said we’ve had months (we JUST bought a house 2 months ago) and she hasn’t heard a reasonable excuse for why we haven’t done it yet. 

Also, we have not asked the people we would want to keep our son if they would yet. 

Am I the Asshole? 

Also if you’re a parent, when did you have a will drawn? 


Edit: the reason I didn’t jump on my own will writing after declining her offer in January is because we were buying a house and wanted to do it at the same time. We just closed in late February (which means yes, we’ve been dragging our feet for the past 2 months) but it’s not like I’ve been actively thinking about it for a year and putting it off. I am grateful to her for reminding us of it in the first place, I just am having a hard time having my boundaries of her not being involved in this respected.


Final edit: guys I don’t care if you think I’m an asshole for not creating a will at conception of an embryo. I don’t care if you think I’m an asshole for waiting to finalize on our house before starting the process. That’s not the question on this post AT. ALL. 
people calling me a shitty parent or neglectful are exactly the reason we lose so many parents to PPD. No one ever brought it up until it was offered to us as a gift from someone I will not accept such an expensive gift from, at which point we were already in a very important process. How am I supposed to know if no one ever tells me about it? I’m not engaging in this post anymore, I got a lot of helpful responses and insightful ones that didn’t outright berate me on something I *didn’t* ask about. I learned a lot from those of you that were here to help me understand.",1
"OK, so here's the deal. Wife and I were scheduled to leave town on Friday for a 6-day visit with family out of state. We asked our family friend, Jenna (15f), to help out with our dog and two cats while we're away. We love Jenna. She has babysat our kids for us and taken care of our cats while out of town before. This was to be a bigger job however, because we adopted a dog last year and now in addition to the checking on our cats, she would need to walk the dog a couple times a day and ostensibly give her some loving attention. Jenna asked for $150 for the week, which we happily agreed to - compared to a professional service, I acknowledge this is a total steal. Also, I like paying kids in the neighborhood versus hiring out to a company, just feels better in my opinion.

Here's the issue: our youngest daughter, just tonight (Wednesday), claimed to be feeling ill, and when we checked her out she had a temperature of 102(!). Our vacation plan was to visit my wife's family, which includes a whole clan of adults and their young kids, so bringing our sick kid would basically be a total dick move. As of right now, we have put the vacation on hold until we see how this illness shakes out.

Regardless, we have to tell Jenna that we don't need a pet sitter anymore. I feel bad canceling on her so I told my wife that we should still kick her $25 (the equivalent of one day's work) for the burden of our cancellation, as a way to let her know that we take her work seriously and value her time.

My wife thinks that we should give Jenna $75, half her proposed pay, because Jenna likely has already made plans for the cash and losing so much would be hard for a kid.

While I acknowledge that it sucks to lose a job because of forces outside of your control, my take is that we are cancelling within a reasonable amount of time for a valid reason, and 1-day worth of pay is a reasonable compensation. I might be showing my ass here a little bit but oh well - when I was a young person, if I took a babysitting job or whatnot and it fell through, I could expect absolute jack shit from the cancelling party. Getting anything as a means of saying sorry for your time would have blown my mind.

That said! That was then and this is now. So I'm asking the good people of reddit to tell me, is $25 for not doing a $150 job fair? Or should buck the fuck up and pitch Jenna $75 for her trouble?

I'm not really invested in this emotionally, my wife and I just disagreed and thought that the internet would be an objective third party. Also, if you guys are going to come at me for only paying $150 for the pet sitting (A price that fully recognize is very very good), all I really have to say is that that was her price, she knows what pet sitters cost, and she is just kinda a cool kid who likes our animals. We're friends with her mom, who is a veterinarian, and odd jobs like this are a way for her to earn spending cash.

All right, I think that's it. You guys can let me know - Am I the asshole?",1
"In 2007, I met Amy, and we became best friends. She eventually dropped out of university, moving back home.

After a few years, community college ended, her job ended, her folks got divorced, and her brother left for college. That left her and her mom, who already had a contentious relationship, causing Amy to further regress. Eventually Amy's sister asked me if Amy could move in to my guest room to escape. We agreed on terms, and she moved in in 2015. She took an online course, then taught online, but never earned enough to contribute rent.

In 2019, I started dating Gia. Gia and Amy never got along, due both to the situation and their personalities, each thinking the other rude. Gia tried to connect Amy with work, but Amy took only one job, that one being only 4 hours a week. Gia disliked that Amy did not take her other leads.

In 2020, Gia wanted me to move in due to the usual 2020 reasons. I considered, but, talking it over with others, it became clear that I wasn't ready for it and felt pushed into it.

Amy was distraught that I might be moving. She said ideally she'd have a year's warning. After deciding not to move in with Gia, I said she'd have that year.

The relationship had some rocky months due to all this. Through hard work, though, it survived. But Gia felt insecure over my being ""behind"" her, relationship-wise, and Amy felt insecure about the friendship due to my spending more time with Gia and the looming move.

Amy helped take care of her mom in her mom's final days. The day I got the news of her passing, after a few minutes of my telling Gia what happened, Gia said that maybe Amy could move out in a month or two rather than four; Amy might move into her mom's old place and I could get a cheaper place if I moved. The comment, though insensitively timed, struck me as not worth fighting over, so I didn't.

A four-day weekend meant more time to spend with both of them. Amy, still at her mom's house, didn't know her family obligations until the day prior to each; I ultimately saw her Friday and Monday afternoons. I initially planned seeing Gia Friday night through Sunday morning. She'd told me in the past not to mention Amy if I didn't have to, and she was busy writing, so I didn't tell her about my days off until I knew Amy's schedule. Upon telling Gia of my free time, she decided to spend an extra day with me. On the drive to Sunday's hike, she started talking over my GPS, asking me why I waited to tell her. I didn't want to argue while I was trying to navigate a busy city street, so I asked her to wait for safety's sake.

The discussion was long and difficult. The sensitivity of being there for a grieving friend brought up the subject of empathy, and I mentioned her reaction to Amy's mom's death. That further complicated the discussion, though Gia made it clear that she'd rather I'd have told her everything in advance. Lesson learned for the future, but AITA for waiting to tell her in the first place?",1
"I'm a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex. I've lived there for 6 years. My neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (I actually don't know her first name but I'll call her Katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. We exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.

So I don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, I don't have as much money for takeout anymore. I'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. I'm gaining weight and I never feel great.

This is where Katie comes in. I can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (I know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). I've even complimented it a few times. So I got the idea that I'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or I can pick it up from her!) at night. She's cooking anyway and then I'd have varied presumably delicious food.

I asked her the next time I saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). The next time I saw her a few days later, I asked her if she was sure and upped the amount I was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and I should get a housekeeper if that's what I want. She also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.

Overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like I was being creepy (I wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). I think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.

So, AITA?

EDIT: People keep assuming I'm sexist because I didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. It's not an assumption for me. He and I have lived across from each other for 6 years. The cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and I've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.

EDIT: Okay. It is abundantly clear that I was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as I hate to admit it, creepy. My instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, I'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. Thanks.",1
"I have a daughter who recently turned 11. She has a different dad from the rest of my children. Whenever one of my kids turns 12 I buy them their first phone which is usually a cheap phone because I don't think a kid needs an expensive phone. She has been complaining recently and asking me to buy her a phone because all her friends have one. I told her she has to wait like her siblings did.

So imagine my surprise when today she came home from her dad's and had a phone with her and not just a cheap phone, I don't know much about phones but it looked expensive.

I was furious so I took her phone away and told her she is not getting it back until she turns 12.

She started to cry and called her dad who called me an asshole for taking the phone away. I told him he had no right to buy that for her and she should have got a cheap phone at her 12th birthday like the rest of her siblings",1
"I (17M) was cooking breakfast for my family a few mornings ago, and was having trouble knowing what to do. I didn't ask for help when I was having trouble because I wanted to figure out how to do it myself so my parents would be happy with me. My dad soon comes in and starts berating me for all the things I did wrong, (which was fair because I had dirtied the sink he just cleaned) and started complaining about how I never do anything around the house to help. I reminded him that I do my own laundry, take care of our pets, clean up after our messes, etc. on a weekly, if not daily basis.   
He, however, wouldn't stop and kept repeating the same point over and over again, at which point I blew up and called him lazy because he does far less than I do and *feels the need to wake me up at seven in the morning on weekends when I'm trying to sleep in when he's fully awake and capable of doing so.* (he wakes up at six and watches youtube on his computer or plays on the ps5 until he has to go to work, which is usually at 7:30 or later)  
He blew up at me for calling him lazy when he's the one who works in the house and pays all the bills and sent me to my room. It's been days and he still hasn't let it go. AITA for calling him lazy when he's the one in the house who works?",1
"For the past week, my wife and I had been anticipating a baseball game for which we had purchased tickets. We like baseball, but we don't attend many games, so traveling into the city to see games is a rare treat. I know, though, that it would take time to drive there and find parking, due to traffic. Because the game started at 7 PM, and we live about 45 minutes from the stadium, I told her this morning that she needed to be ready to get in the car and go by 6 PM. 

Well, my wife is an avid gamer, so she was engrossed in her latest video game when the clock struck 5:45 PM. She has struggled to plan in the past, and I get tired of reminding her that she needs to budget time to get ready. It's as if she has no concept of time at all, similar to a young child. Well, I was ready to go by 6 PM, and she was in the bathroom. I saw this as an opportunity to teach her personal responsibility, so I simply left the house without saying a word, got in the car, and started driving to the game.

It took my wife a few minutes to figure out what I had done, but when she called me, she was absolutely furious. She said that it was a completely unacceptable move for me to leave without telling her and that she now had no way to get to the game without paying for parking. I told her that I got tired of constantly waiting for her and that she would plan better next time if she didn't want to get left behind. I also reminded her that I had told her that morning when I expected her to be ready to leave. Absolutely none of this seemed to matter, though, and she rudely hung up on me after yelling out more insults.

Frankly, I think it's completely insane that a grown woman is unable to budget her time, and I'm starting to suspect that she is doing this on purpose because she's a narcissist who expects me to accommodate her. After all, she's not a dumb woman. She has a science degree. Well, she never showed up to the stadium, and I didn't hear from her the whole game, but when I got home, there was a note on the door. She told me that I wasn't welcome in the bedroom and that I should sleep on the couch. I can't believe she wants to be this much of a pill. If I had waited for her, I would have missed the first pitch. I made my expectations clear, and she couldn't be bothered to meet them. I feel like she should be apologizing to me. AITA?",1
"I was close to getting off work when a costumer came in and started being kinda flirty. I dealt with it by being professional. I mentioned that I was getting off work soon when he asked, and he offered to pay me six hundred dollars to get coffee. I could tell he had money because he was throwing it around the store, and I figured why not? It’s not like anything is going to happen in a busy coffee shop, and the coffee shop he was offering to take me to was right next door. 

So, I went and listening to him talk for two straight hours. I just nodded along, and he just kept talking, and talking, and ranting about work, and stuff like that. I must have said ten words the entire conversation. At the end, he said we should make an “arrangement” and do this again. I said sure, but I was really not planning on doing this ever again. He gave me six hundred dollars, and then I left. 

I didn’t tell my boyfriend because he’d have freaked the hell out and told me not to go. Probably showed up at my work. I did tell him afterwords, though, and he was (obviously) really upset with me. He’s really mad, but I don’t really get why? I didn’t do anything with this guy. I just had coffee, listened to him talk for an hour, got six hundred dollars, and that was that. 

If some “sugar momma” was going to pay him six hundred dollars just to have coffee, I wouldn’t have a problem with it. I did nothing I wouldn’t do with a friend. 

Speaking of rich coffee dude, I messaged him after talking to my boyfriend and I told him that I couldn’t do this again. Sorry about that. He replied and said it was cool. So, at least he was a nice guy about the whole thing. 

So, am I the asshole?

"I (21F) attended my aunt’s wedding a few weeks ago. I was not part of the wedding, just a guest which I was fine with. Before the wedding, everyone was advised to drink lots of water and eat beforehand because it was going to be extremely hot that day.  The wedding started at 5:00pm, and I had absolutely nothing to eat or drink up until then except maybe a granola bar because I was extremely busy that day. So when it was time for the wedding, I was already tired and hungry. About thirty minutes into the wedding, (which was at a church btw), I was feeling uneasy and lightheaded so I excused myself to go to the washroom. As I was walking, I got that feeling like I was about to collapse. The next thing I can remember was coming to and see lots of people surrounding me including the bride and groom. Apparently, when I fainted, I fell onto the photographer who was crouched down near me. Not only that, but he dropped the camera lens down and it broke. Tbh I don’t even remember seeing the photographer but I may have been too dizzy or something to have seen him. The wedding was a bit of a cheaper one, so the photographer was a family friend of the grooms who only had one camera with him. The bride was just in tears that she won’t have any good pictures from her wedding. The photographer insisted that he could drive home and grab a different one, but it would take too long. The bride was indeed mad at me, but I feel it was a bit harsh as it was extremely embarrassing for me already. Fainting never even crossed my mind as something that would happen at all. They did get pictures but they were on cellphones.

I (16F) went to the mall yesterday to get a variety of things, including makeup. In the makeup store, I saw these two boys Liam, who was 10 and Huxton who was 11.   
  
Liam was looking for skincare products like Drunk Elephant and retinol/anti-aging creams. I first saw him while in the skincare section and he was messing up the samplers/testers and was making a mess, I told him that he should clean up after he was done and he told me to “fuck off”, I also saw him being rude to an employee who was trying to get him to find a product besides an anti-aging cream.  
  
After that, I went along and was looking through other parts of the store, when I saw a group of like six of seven middle school boys near the cologne, I asked them what they were doing and they said they were looking for cologne because girls like that. It was sweet to see and one of the boys said something about how it’s 2024 and how a lot of the boys at their school care more about hygiene and skincare now and how only the “weird nerdy boys” call it “gay” these days. One of the boys who was with them was Huxton, he was wearing some vintage basketball jersey.  
  
As I was in line, I ran into Huxton and Liam, they told me their mom was coming with the money for their purchases. Liam was talking to a girl who looked about my age, he asked if she had anti-wrinkle cream and when she said no, he told her “I’d suggest you get it”, I told this kid that wasn’t very nice, Huxton said “Liam, stop”, and tried to apologize for his brother’s behavior, their mom came and paid for the items.  
  
Later, I saw them in the food court and I wanted to compliment Huxton for his manners, I went up to him and told him I thought he has good manners and he thanked me. Their mom asked what I was doing and I told her and she said that her kids had great manners.  
  
I felt like I had to clarify it was only Huxton who had good manners, she then started to get mad and said “Huxton is 11, Liam is 10, stop expecting them to act the same”, she also accused me of homophobia because Huxton is masculine and Liam is “just a normal gay boy”. She also said  “wait until you have kids” and that I was too young to criticize Liam’s behavior.

"So I had a competition today and my friend texted me to ask about it. She always texts after a competition to ask how it went and whether the it was over or not. I told her that we had a certain portion of it today and the rest will be tomorrow. My friend then asked me how it went today.

I wasn’t in the mood to answer her numerous questions, and I felt she was being rather nosy. Also, I was really busy at the moment and she ought to have known that. So I replied with, “go and sleep girl.” She then replied saying, “wdym?? It’s only 7.” I left her on read because I didn’t feel like replying.

"Throwaway account here. My wife (F33) and I (M37) are expecting our first child in late March. Everything is on track with no major complications - I believe there is a chance that she'll deliver a bit early due to placenta position, but that's about it.

My team lead requested that I accompany him on a work conference for 1-2 days in early March. This team lead / skip level essentially determines my growth and responsibilities (currently product management / partner management) on the team. Additionally, some of the partners with whom we want to meet could directly contribute to my work priorities. The job is very important for me to keep especially during this not-so-great employment market, but I'm also doing relatively well on the team so not very high risk.

My wife does not want me to go because she is concerned that she will be full term by that point, i could get sick (and bring something back), flight could get delayed, etc. I dont think that it's a big deal, but i also don't want to ignore her feelings. I do believe that if I don't go, no one will, and hitting my annual goals will be harder. I was also going to have minor surgery that also worried her - I moved that a few months later as a result. But the conference can't be moved.

WIBTA if I were to go for a day but give my lead a heads up that my schedule may change at any moment? Or am I being unreasonable? Nothing has been decided or booked yet, so hoping to gain some perspectives.",1
"I (40M) recently lost my father (76M). I have two siblings, my twin brother and older sister (44). We all grew up together in my parents's house. It is a large multi story 5 bedroom house worth almost half a million dollars.

My father's will stated that his assets, cash, house, etc... were to be divided equally among the three of us. While in town for my father's funeral, I asked my siblings when a good time would be to meet up about putting the house on the market. My sister told me that there was no need, because my father had sold the house prior to his death.

I was confused, because he was still living in it. My sister went on to explain that my father had been sick for years and was deep in debt, so he'd needed to sell the house. Of course, with his health as poor as it was, that would be a complicated undertaking. So my sister and her husband bought the house with the understanding that he would continue living there for free.

I was flabbergasted. When my father died, he only had about 120K in liquid assets. Her story made no sense to me. I demanded details.

She said that the mortgage lender would only approve them for 375k, which is far less than the house is worth. My dad apparently spent the other 250k paying off his debts, paying for treatments and ""maintaining his quality of life"" as my sister put it. So basically she's telling me my inheritance is 40k and no more while she gets that + a house.

I called her a thief that took advantage of our father when he was vulnerable. She basically pocketed the difference in the value of the house out of my inheritance. She got really mad. She told me that she and her husband have been struggling to pay two mortgages for years while also raising four kids (not my kids, not my problem) and getting no income from the second house, but that was her CHOICE, and she got a house out of it. She started yelling at me and crying, so her husband intervened and took her away.

I turned to my brother for support, but he just shrugged and said he couldn't find it within him to care about a house after we just buried Dad. I miss Dad too, and I hate fighting with my sister, but what she did was wrong. I've reached out to a lawyer and am planning to sue my sister, but I'm nervous. I know this will permanently fracture my family. I just want what's rightfully mine, but is it worth blowing up my sister's life? AITA?",1
"Can hardly believe this is an issue but here goes,

I work on a small team at a medium sized corporation. One of my more senior teammates (not my manager) got a intern for the Winter and wanted to take her out to lunch. He invited all of us to go with him. When we got to the restaurant I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat so I ended up ordering two different entrees so I could try different things. Senior teammate asked if I skipped breakfast or something and I laughed it off. I figured it would be fine since it's on the corporate card, right? Wrong. Turns out management didn't approve the lunch but my teammate thought it was important to do anyway as a nice gesture to our intern so he ended up putting down his card. The meal came out to $100 between the five of us, with my food totaling $45. 

To top it all off, the food wasn't even that good so I ended up~~ sending both entrees back half eaten~~ only eating half of each. I don't think it's my fault that the food was bad or even that I was starving, so I can't understand why my teammate would be upset at me. He's asked me to limit my eating if we ever go out to lunch again, like, come on dude? Hopefully you kind folks can tell me what I can say to him to get him to move on. 

So folks, AITA?

"So, for context, I (18M) am very good friends with this girl (17F). We met on a summer camp in 2021, but when it was over we cut contacts. Around three weeks ago, we started talking again, and we've been chatting and talking basically every day, meeting at the gym or going out to eat. (I don't know how relevant to the story this might be, but it's fair to say i kinda have a crush on her)

I've got my driver's license three months after my birthday, and luckily we managed to get a decent car for a very good price, so I am one of the few people among my friends to have a car of my own.

These weeks, I've given her a ride three or four times when we hung out together, as I don't mind driving at all, and I've always done that very happily. It never bothered me in terms of time, since she lives 10 minutes away from me, nor money, because, for 7kms, asking someone to pay is ridiculous imo.

Yesterday, she told me that she wants to pay for the pizza we're going to eat tonight at the church group I go often to (since we're in a lot of people, it's going to be 5€ each, and she wants to pay them for me), AND she wants to pay for the dinner we're eating tomorrow night (considering where we're going, since it's a form of a local festival, it should be between 15 and 20€) in exchange for the few rides I gave her.

I'm really thankful, since she's one of the few friends who do that, as some people didn't even thank me for the rides, but at the same time I feel very guilty for it, since I feel like she's putting on the table way more than I did.

I tried compromising (my idea was that she could pay for the pizza tonight, and each of us pays for themselves at the festival), but no, she is heavily firm on her idea of being kind all the way.

Neither of us is in a bad economic situation, so it's not a matter of money for me (I only wrote about the cost of everything to show the reason why I felt guilty) and I'm definitely not mad or angry towards her act of kindness, but as I said I never did this expecting to be paid back, and that's why I'm still very hesitant to accept it.

So, would I be the AH for going against her will of repaying me back, and/or should I try a different approach to the matter?",1
"Hey guys,

I was wondering whether I am the AH about my expectation of my partner and family members saying good bye or good night back to me when I say it to them (in my case in person and over videochat). 

I was talking to my brother on a videocall yesterday, and after having had a good time talking, we agreed to bring the call to an end, which is usually when we talk about our plans for tomorrow and what else we might still do that day or evening.
Yesterday though, he told me about an issue in his time schedule that frustrated him a lot, and I offered some advice. Knowing we wanted to hang up, I asked if he had anything else he wanted to say. He said no, so I said ""talk to you tomorrow, sleep well, bye"", which he didn't respond to. After repeating myself, thinking that it was maybe due to a bad connection, he got angry at me and said that if I want to hang up, I should feel free to do so. I tried to express my confusion about his negative reaction, but as he wasn't willing to engage in further conversation, I dropped it, said bye and hung up. 

Shortly after that call, I got ready for bed and went by my partner to see what he's up to, maybe talk a little. As he was busy on his computer, I just came in and said good night. He looked at me shortly, looked back at his screen and said ""bye"" in an annoyed tone. Again confused, I just stood there for a second, then asked if saying good night in a friendly way was too much to ask for, as he didn't even needed to interrupt what he was doing. He told me that I was trying to demand attention and that he overheard my conversation with my brother, saying that I also forced him to say good night to me. 

In my view, it is a sign of mutual acknowledgement that the other person is leaving, and also a sign of respect. When I get ignored on this, I will feel disregarded, as I don't feel like they value me enough to engage with me. I get it when someone might be not in the mood, but if they aren't angry at me specifically, then why would they not just say it back? 

Now, I think might be the AH because I do expect a response when I tell someone goodbye or good night and won't leave the room or call before my goodbyes were acknowledged and responded to. I get that some people say good bye and immediately just hang up, or say goodnight to their partner and leave the room, because to them it is more of just a thing to say, and less of a mutual interaction. And if they view it that way, maybe I am the AH for trying to make them say it back to me when they don't want to or feel it's necessary. 

So, am I the AH? ",1
"I'm an aspiring novelist, it's my passion in life and has been since I was a little kid. I've loved writing short stories and films and plays and have even won awards. It's a huge aspect of my life but I don't bring it up very often because I don't want to be annoying.

I'd lacked the motivation to write a full novel basically my entire life, and just earlier this year finally found the gumption to turn that around. I finally, after years and years of thinking about it and putting it off, finished my first ever novel. To me, this is the biggest accomplishment of my life. I sent it to all my friends and family right away to hear their feedback and opinions.

It's been over six months and I'm pretty sure none of them have even fucking started it yet. I sent them a google doc, which lets you see when people are reading it. I check it every day because I'm nerotic, and I very rarely ever see any activity at all. Once I broached the subject just a little when we're all on discord, but all I got was a ""oh man, I can't wait to be in the mood to start reading it!"" from everyone. 

Listen, I know I'm nagging. I don't wanna be that guy. I don't wanna keep asking them if they've been reading it, I don't want to be annoying. But six fucking months? Keep in mind, my novel is a fantasy adventure story, and my nerdy friends eat that shit up breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We all play in a DnD campaign together and have for years, they read fantasy novels all the time, and play fantasy video games constantly. I know it's not an issue of genre or taste, they _love_ this shit.

In particular, I sent it to my closest friend seven months ago because I knew he also dabbled in creative writing, and I wanted his opinion before sending it out to the others. Every time we get the group together, he always mentions how much reading he's been doing. He reads every night. Specifically, he binges fantasy novels. I pulled him aside one time and asked him what he thought of my book, and he told me ""oh, I wasn't talking about yours, I've been reading other stuff."" But like... why fucking say that? Why bring up that you've been reading so much lately when your good friend who sent you his novel many months ago is _standing right next to you?_ Isn't that... kinda shitty? In the time since I sent it to him, he's read over _four_ other fantasy novels.

This is my passion, my dream. They all know that. I want to get this story published if I can, but I need feedback. I want to iron out any glaring issues before sending it to professionals. I can't do that if nobody fucking reads it.

WIBTA if I sent them a group text like ""hey, it's been over six months since I sent you guys my book. I'm sure you've all read it by now, so let's get together and have a book club sometime!"" knowing full well they haven't touched it yet? I know it's super passive aggressive and manipulative, but... over six months? Really? Am I in the wrong here? I can't keep waiting forever.

EDIT: By the way, I made it explicitly clear to them that they didn't have to give any feedback if they didn't want to. It's mostly about them not reading any of it at all when they said they would.

EDIT 2: Oh, and this is the second draft, not first. Probably should have mentioned that.",1

It turns out he hasn't, since he wants me to buy him a beer and teriyaki sauce at the store, with my own money, which I don't want to support those things. He is upset because I won't ""return the favor"" for how he bought me all the things I wanted when I visited him, how I'm forcing my ideas on him, etc. I say that it is different because he isn't opposed to any of those things, and with my money, I will get him anything else.

"Using a throwaway,

I have two girls, R who's 29 and K who's 23. 

We had equal college funds saved up for both girls. R received scholarships, and her college wasn't extremely expensive to begin with. She ended up using about a third of the fund for her bachelors, decided not to pursue further studies and went into working.

K also received some financial aid but she ended up going through the entire fund. She's recently started med school.

R's been thinking about going back to school to complete a masters degree. I was happy to hear that, and she asked if we could help her out with costs. We weren't sure at first, but I talked it over with my husband, and we agreed with her that since she didn't initially need her entire college fund for studies, she should be allowed to use the money to pursue further studies now. 

The situation that's come up now, we all got together for Thanksgiving and K heard that we agreed to funding R's masters. She was mad and pulled me aside, saying this is completely unfair and if I'm paying for her post grad, I should at least help out with some of her med school costs. 

I told her this isn't like that, it's because R didn't originally use her money. K was still upset and she ended up leaving early, and I know she got into a bit of a verbal fight with R.

"We’ve been dating for about 4 months and mostly it’s been good. He’s cute, smart, and very successful. The only downside is that he’s almost addicted to buying things that are on sale or have coupons despite being a VP at his company. I’m not talking about sometimes or even most of the time, I would be alright with that. He never buys anything at full price. NEVER!

He plans his cooking around what’s on sale that week at the grocery stores. All of his clothes were bought on sale or clearance, even his socks and boxers. Last week we were at my friend’s house for dinner and she commented on his shirt. He proudly said he got it on clearance last year for $20. I was mortified. Lastly, we don’t go to any restaurant unless he finds a coupon or they’re running some kind of special.

Things came to ahead last night when we went out to dinner. He had a digital coupon for buy one get one free. For some reason, the restaurant’s computer didn’t recognize the deal and the poor cashier couldn’t make it work. We were holding up the crowded line because he refused to pay for both dinners. Finally the cashier called the manager but he was busy somewhere else in the restaurant. While we waited, the people behind us were getting annoyed. I was so embarrassed I left him standing in line by himself and went to the car.

We argued the entire drive home. We were supposed to go to the movies, because he got free tickets, but I wasn’t in the mood so he dropped me off. We haven’t texted today at all.

"
My wife and I are both 19. We have known each other since kindergarten and have been dating for many years. We got married last year.

Together, we have 3 year-old twins, a girl and a boy.

I joined the army 2 years ago. We are living in subsidized housing on the base. My wife currently stays at home to take care of the kids and does freelance writing as well. She mainly writes children books and she earns a small amount of income from the royalties. Before the worldwide pandemic she also made income from flipping houses.

My wife is very intelligent and she was always the top of her class, while I didn’t do well in school. Ultimately she wants to get a bachelor’s degree and pursue her dream of becoming a lawyer.

I want to support her the best I can, but even if she attends the university near the base, it will still be difficult to juggle taking care of the kids and getting a degree. Plus, if she goes to university, she will have less time for writing, and then we have to rely on my income alone.

She told me that she wants to study for  economics degree next year. I told her that it’s not feasible and that she should at least wait until our kids are in school (in 2 more years). She was quite upset and said I don’t care about her dreams and that she can’t be a housewife forever. I told her Im not forcing her to be a housewife, it’s just that the time is not right at the moment for her to pursue higher education. 

We all had to make sacrifices...I didn’t want to join the military but it was the best option for us because it meant my family can have a stable life and housing.

"I (29f) flat with another student and one guy (30s) who works mon-fri. 

Last week he asked us if we could not run the washing machine after 10pm because he has to get up for work 'most mornings'. The thing is he's often up and about at that time of night anyway. The next night (a week night) he didn't get home until 10:30pm. Another week night he was still in the shower after 11pm. Tonight (Sunday) he's on the phone at 11pm (he is quite loud and I can hear him through the walls). (He was also originally only supposed to work from home sometimes but now it seems he works from home p much full time and so doesn't have to get up as early as when he was commuting.) 

The other thing is - the other two of us are night owls, we usually stay up late and get up late. The flat mate who asked us not to do washing at night will put the machine on in the morning when we're both still asleep. He did exactly that the morning after he asked us not to run it at night. And he did this morning, Sunday morning. The machine shares a wall with his room, but it's also just in the hallway (not behind a door) right opposite my and the other flat mate's doors so it's not exactly quiet anywhere. I do hear it but just ignore it and go back to sleep, and haven't complained about it before (except when he ran it earlier, bc that was when it was peak power pricing and cost more to run).

I do washing at night bc I do sleep late, but when I get up I want to be able to hang it straight on the line to make the most of the drying weather. I always check the forecast before I do washing and try plan around that, but our weather is temperamental and can change quickly. My flat mate DOESN'T check the forecast and if he can't hang his washing outside he'll just put it in his room (it's been raining on and off all today). We also can't run the washing machine (at night) any earlier than 9pm because otherwise it's peak power and it costs more, and sometimes I'm out until after 9pm and need to get my stuff together and have food etc before I get to washing (if it's going to be nice the next day).

I don't run the washing machine super late (it's never on after 12) and will try get a gauge of whether other people are still up first which maybe I don't always get right, but he almost always puts the machine on as soon as he can in the morning when we're still in bed. One night he actually turned the machine off mid wash with my load in it without even saying anything to me (he definitely hadn't been in bed when I put the load on). If I hadn't noticed my washing would have just been sitting in gross water in the machine all night. I get my washing out when it's done and put it in my basket in my room so it doesn't get all machine musty and so the machine IS free in the morning if someone wants to use it before I get up.

So AITA for wanting to just ignore him and keep doing what I do, since he stays up late on 'work nights' when it suits him and doesn't consider when I'm asleep in the morning?",1
"I was just fired from my job for ""not being a team player.""

I'm autistic, so I might've missed social cues and acted inappropriately without realizing it. **I did not disclose to my workplace that I'm autistic because it's something I am embarrassed about -** I just today told them I had issues with anxiety.

**EDIT:** Autism has nothing to do with my lateness and I didn't intend it as an excuse - I mentioned it only in regards to my coworkers being upset with me. 

# Why I was fired

**My behaviour:**  I'm autistic. I act weird sometimes but I don't mind feedback.

I only found out my team was upset with my behaviour AFTER I was fired - a coworker shared some of the comments she told our boss that contributed to my firing.

**My lateness:**  I travelled to work 1hr +/- 15 mins every day using the TTC, and we all know it sucks. I was late my first 2 days, but after that I began leaving the house earlier to ensure I got there early.

Yesterday,  my commute was badly delayed by train cancellations, and long story short, I ended up coming to work 15 minutes late by asking someone to drop me off.

**The Incident™**:  Later that day, an anti-war protest was happening 10 minutes away from my work, and as I'm Ukrainian, I used my 30 minute break to attend the march for 10-15 minutes.

*Note: Only 1 other person was working with me at the store that day, but I asked her if she was okay with me going. She said yes.*

A friend drove me there, and I intended to get back in time via Uber.

My phone died and I couldn't call an Uber. A failed taxi request, a call to my coworker to update her, and a streetcar trip later I got back to work 50 mins over my break.

L**et me be clear that I don't think that's ok -**  I apologized to my team and offered to work overtime today to make up for the hour I lost. I felt terrible.

# The aftermath

My shift manager's only reply to my apology + offer to work overtime was telling me to just work normal hours, and that we would talk later. I understand this is a totally normal response, but I have debilitating anxiety, which I explained to her and asked if we could have a call  sooner rather than later. She just repeated that we would talk later, and this caused me to have an anxiety attack due to which I couldn't work for the next half hour.

A bit later the owner called me and said that she had to let me go due to me not being a team player.

# tl;dr

1. Is it normal that no-one mentioned to me that my behaviour was problematic until I got fired?
2. Why did my boss not take into consideration that I'm currently working to earn money to send to Ukraine? She could have easily given me a final warning and I would have completely understood. But she chose to fire me  on the spot and leave me with no income when I have a war in my hometown.
3. What does the unpredictability of public transit have to do with my work  attitude? I left home early to account for that, but I have no way to predict severe delays.

**Could you help me understand, Reddit? Am I the asshole here?**",1
"As the title says,  I 23F called my close friend Olivia 20F for her beliefs. 

For context last year Jan Liv was dumped by her 4 month BF, Nate 21M She was heartbroken, she stopped eating, stayed in her room all day, scrolled for hours on tiktok, stalked his socials and stopped functioning.Soon Nate got a new gf, Chloe(20 F, she didn't know who she was at first until later) only 4 days after their break up. All the way through this time period I supported her the best I could.

I thought she had moved on after a month of her finally gaining her character back but no, she had made tons of accounts online trying to seduce Nate into dating her, Went on for a while until she had moved on and got some new friends and a potential bf. it seemed like everything had sorted itself out.

Only 2 months after Olivia supposedly moved on from her ex she found out that Nate had proposed to Chloe, At first my friend kept her cool, she didn't care. Then she found out his fiancé was her late best friend. That was when she sunk back into depression. Again, I supported her until one day she was abnormally happy.

I asked her what had put her in such a good mood and this is where it started Olivia pulled out her phone and showed me a tiktok, can't exactly remember it but it was a video about shifting minded , She then began talking about her script, reality and what was in it. It seemed great, a perfect place where she was happy and had everything she wanted.

Out of curiosity I asked her to show me it and she obliged but it was horrifying. It first started with her in her ""DR."" ( Desired Reality ) Olivia was said to be a seemingly perfect girl that very conveniently fit Nate's type and seemed to be similar to Chloe. She wrote she had a manipulative personality, had everything she wanted, got away with crimes etc. Strange, but okay. We continued to her ""S/O."" Unexpectedly, her bf was Nate, she had even written ""identical to CR Nate."" Okay, this is getting really weird now but then I saw how she wanted to treat him. They were apparently very possessive of eachother and in summary a very toxic relationship but it got worse.

She wrote all about how Chloe, once again, ""identical to CR Chloe"" was treated badly by DR Olivia and all sorts of other vile stuff. When she finished she asked what I thought of it and I said exactly what I thought, that she's crazy. Olivia didn't take this well and shouted all sorts of stuff at me, how I was the crazy one, unsupportive and apparently inlove with her ex. ( Hah! The irony! ) We got into a big argument about it and it eventually ended in her storming out my house and back to her parent's place. 

I tried contacting her a few hours after our fight but she hasn't returned my calls or messages. I reached out to her Mother and apparently she's locked herself up in her room and hasn't left for a long time, only for her needs. She even tells at her family to quiet down as she's trying to ""shift.""",1
"For almost 3 years I (F45) have lost count of the amount of times I have asked my partner (M53) to have a simple conversation with his son (M18) to clean up after himself. I have no issue with his son and we have a good relationship other than he can not seem to put a plate in the sink or heaven forbid in the actual dishwasher.  This has resulted in many many heated discussions which all get turned around on me. There is always an excuse why he can’t talk to him about, that he is in a sensitive place right now. I will admit that yes during covid there were times that he was having a tough time, but now it has reached the point it is impacting the way I view my partner.  
I don’t think a simple request for him to ask his 18yr old son to put a dish in the dishwasher or clean up after he has cooked for himself is out of line but I am being made to think I am the asshole.  He swings past after work and uses plates, bowls, knives, chopping boards etc then leaves to go to sport training and back to his
Mothers, leaving  me to clean up the mess when I come home. When I tell my partner his response is ‘oh he’s a jerk face!’  My partner is also happy to bitch and moan about the situation with his parents and other family but never actually talks to his son.

I constantly consider his son, I make sure there is food for him to eat and snack on when he decides to come over, I cook meals for him, pick up things he needs, bake things that he requests. I am not against caring for him in anyway but I am tired of cleaning up after him, he can’t even put his dish in the sink after we all eat together.  This is now becoming a bigger issue than it actually needs to be as my partner refuses to talk to him as he doesn’t like confrontation.  I don’t feel it is my place to-parent  his child, and know past relationship there was an issue with the son being told what to do. 

I feel he is showing zero respect towards me by not just dealing with the issue, AITA? ",1
"This story actually takes place over multiple years. So here goes. Also, English isn't my first language, so I apologise for my poor language skills in advance. 

A little background, I work in corporate HR. My company has a very generous maternity leave policy. It gives you 26 paid weeks off plus gives you the option of taking a month or so more if you have extra sick or personal leaves left. Or else you can take unpaid leave for the same time. 

So part of my responsibilities  is to make recommendations for selecting employees for specific  projects.  So a couple of years ago, there was a huge project that needed a team to be created for. Being part of a project like this would normally establish your career in this industry. You could basically decide your own career path on the back of the reputation you get based on a project like this. It would be hectic and difficult, but worth it in the end.

We interviewed prospective people within the company and selected a core team that would take it up. Among this team was M, a recently married female who is generally thought to be a hard worker and quite knowledgeable. Like with everyone else. We interviewed her for the spot and asked her if she wanted to be part of this project. 

However,  a month or so, M announces that she was pregnant and that she would be taking her maternity leave in a month's time. She would be completely unavailable for around 7 months or so and basically leave the team short-staffed for the major part of the project. We had to quickly select a replacement, get them uptospeed, and have them take over. It meant more work for everyone, minor delays, etc. 

What pissed off the top management was that M knew she was pregnant when she joined the team. She never mentioned it during the interview. By not telling anyone in advance, everyone felt that she couldn't be trusted in the future. She basically became a pariah and no team lead wanted her in any critical projects. 

Within a year, M realised she progress much in her career in this particular company and left for another job. 
Fast forward a little while and I was talking with the HR guy from the company M had joined and he asked me about her. And I told him the truth. Both that she was a good worker and is dedicated, but that is not really honest or trustworthy. I told him the story in detail. 

Now this has basically meant that M gets a similar treatment in the new company, she is considered a good employee and team player, but no-one wants to select her for any critical projects. 

Some of my friends say that telling the HR guy about the incident makes an a$$. It has gotten me to feel a bit guilty and I wasn't sure what the right move should have been. 

So reddit, what do you think? AITA?

P.S. please feel free to ask for more information if you need it, but no details of the industry or company. For security and privacy reasons


Edit 1. Just to be clear, M knew she was pregnant when she was being considered for the project. She wanted to be in the project so didn't disclose it. Her team had to stretch themselves thin to make it up.

Our company as a general rule has no issues with women taking time off for pregnancy. Even beyond the policy mandated time. The most I've come across is a woman getting 15 months off. She came back to work and faced no repercussions. 

I should have mentioned this before, but HR guy was formally asking me about M. It wasn't like I was talking about her at the pub.


Edit 2: I dont know where people got the idea she was just a month into the pregnancy when she was interviewed. Just to clarify, she was pregnant long enough that she knew she wouldn't be completing the project. She didn't mention it coz she wanted the project on her resume. 

Our company never punishes an employee for taking ML or in general any medical leave. But in this case, team leads did not want her on their team for high profile projects after she returned. Coz they didn't trust her to be forthright.

Edit 3. I thought this would be obvious, but our source for Ms motivations were M herself. She admitted all of it herself. 

Also, just to clarify, I didn't just put a blanket statement of her trustworthiness. I explained the incident and explained that due to this, her coworkers all consider her untrustworthy.

Edit 4: I never realised I'd need to clarify this, but there is absolutely no legal issue with what I did. It is completely legal and is a common practice",1
"Hello Reddit. I hope this post makes sense as I am very upset right now and in need of some clarity.

Me (32F) and my partner (33M) of 5 years share a home together. I like to take occasional trips about 5x/yr to go see friends, and when I am gone he likes to have friends over, which is totally okay. 

The past couple times I have left, when I have come home from 3-4 days of near constant socializing as I usually stay with friends, I come home to him and some of our friends at home. I don't have anything against him socializing, but it is distressing to me to have to come home to people in my home. I am at that point socially burnt out and tired from travel. I have tried to be okay with this as I don't want to be controlling or in the business of telling him he can't see people.

I have tried to just go into our bedroom to avoid everyone, but even then I still can't really relax because I feel confined to the bedroom. It is worth noting that even at this point saying hi and having basic small talk with more people pushes me into extreme discomfort. I don't know why I am like this, I have tried not to be, but I can't help it.

The last time this happened, I ended up crying in front of our friends, which was really embarrassing. I didn't mean to cry and I didn't do it out of manipulation or anything, I was just so incredibly socially burnt out, overwhelmed with people to the point of tears. There wasn't an argument or anything, our friends were just making small talk with me and it was at that point I started to cry. I was mortified.

It was after this that I asked him that, in the future, would it be okay if, when I come home, he could not have people over so I could truly relax and avoid situations like the above in the future. He didn't seem happy with this but he agreed.

This weekend is coming around and I am out of town. When I made the plans I wasn't sure if I would be back Sunday or Monday and he said just let me know when you know. Today I told him that I would be back Sunday.

He told me that he was disappointed because he wanted to have someone over on Sunday. He said feels like I am limiting him, he wants more ""control and independence"" over his weekends.

I got upset because he still has options - he can have someone over Friday or Saturday, he could go over to someone else's or out to a bar on Sunday, he could even have someone over Sunday as long as they would be gone before 5 but he wants to have someone over on Sunday when I get home. He hasn't even made any plans yet he's just upset that now he can't specifically have someone over on Sunday evening. I offered up all of these possibilities and he turned them all down.

I feel like it's reasonable for me to ask that I come home to peace and quiet, but now he's upset, he stormed off from the conversation. I feel terrible because I do want him to have his social time, don't want to limit him, and have him make the most of his weekends since he works really hard during the week. AITA?",1
"Throwaway Account

I (30m) am in an unforeseen situation and feel like the people I know in feel life are too close to the situation to give a less biased perspective and have come to Reddit.

First off, I am the type of person who doesn't like troubling other with potentially negative and/or life changing news until I have all the facts and, preferably, get all my ducks in a rows. I feel like wasting someone's time and causing unwarranted stress can be an A move. Now on to the story.

Six years ago I found out that my then girlfriend was cheating on me. The lease on our apartment was up for renewal and I had gotten a job offer in another state, so instead of angrily confronting her I ghosted her. Told asked my family to block her, which they readily did, and then blocked any mutual friends who encouraged me to reach out to her. Send a message to the side guy that he could have her and that I wouldn't be on social anymore. Although after about two months I was back on with new profile(s).

I was upset for a while but did move on and I am now engaged to my girlfriend of three years. Life was going great for me until out of the blue I was contacted by my ex who told me that I had a five-year-old son. Obviously, I called B.S. and blocked her but she managed to get a hold of my sister and she convinced me that I DNA test would be best.  I unblocked her and said that until the DNA test proved I was the father I wanted no other contact with her. I told my fiancé that I needed to go out of town to handle unexpected family issue and that my sister would be coming with me. Since my sister was coming my fiancé didn't ask for details and the DNA test was done. Unfortunately, I'm tied to my ex for the next 13 years and I told my fiancé that very same day.

She was shocked and hurt that I kept this from her. However, I explained that I didn't want her to worry for nothing if the kid wasn't mine and that I was just trying to protect her. I understand that my fiancé will need time to process and reevaluate things and I'm giving her space. Although now that everyone is starting to find out that I have a son some of them are saying I'm TA for not telling my fiancé sooner. I honestly thought that I was doing the right thing but AITA?  


ETA: Because I keep seeing this.

1. I ghosted my cheating ex because I didn't want to hear her excuses or see her cry. I didn't want to give her anymore of my time and a part of me took some satisfaction in thinking how she was going to struggle with the rent now that I was gone. 
2. Between my ex contacting my sister and me telling my fiancé it was about 9 days.
3. The only reason my sister went with me was because she already knew and wanted to come. If my sister hadn't of known I would've gone alone. It wasn't because I trusted her more than my fiancé.
4. When I entered a relationship with my fiancé I wasn't aware that I was a father so I didn't ""lie"" when I was with her. I don't know why people think I withheld having a kid for years.   ",1
Some friends and I was going out for my girlfriend’s birthday next week. It was mainly a couple event at a sushi restaurant my girl loves. My friend Mike just entered a relationship and I asked him to bring his girlfriend. He gets back to me a few days later explaining that his new girlfriend doesn’t like sushi but she’d be happy about eating anywhere else. I said that’s fine don’t come. Mike said he’ll talk to her again but I explained to Mike him and her are no longer invited since you already tried to change the restaurant just because your new girlfriend does like it. He tries arguing with me that he wants to come because it’s the first time she’s been invited to the friend group. I repeated that they are no longer invited because it’s my girlfriend’s birthday and I don’t want any drama. Mike tried to say there wouldn’t be but I told him his new girlfriend was already acting like a diva at someone else’s party so that’s why she’s not going. He tried saying she just didn’t like sushi and I said that’s ok you don’t have to take her to a sushi restaurant for her birthday but we are still going for my girlfriend’s birthday and you guys are no longer invited. Mike called me a dick and told the other couples who was going about how disrespectful I’m being to his girlfriend over this and he just wanted her to feel comfortable with everyone.,1
"I have a friend who is a single mother with a six year old son. Three days ago, my friend left him with me unannounced due to an emergency. I had to call off work with not enough notice so I plan to be reprimanded tomorrow for my next shift. I tried to refuse him, even threatened that I would not change any diapers but she didn't listen. She came to my doorstep, left him there, and I only caught her as she was getting back into her car.

She didn't return for six hours and I held true to my word: I didn't change a single diaper. The kid should not be in diapers anyways. I supervised him insofar I turned the TV on and went to do my own thing. He's nonverbal and on the spectrum so he was absorbed into watching TV so there were no issues.

I've been chewed out to an ungodly level for this, specifically not changing his diaper but I didn't agree to this at all. Was I the asshole?",1
"**edit: the 1000 comments saying the exact same thing and the unhinged dm’s telling me to kill my dog can stop now because I already said 50 comments in that I was TA and that I’ll work harder on retraining her with the help of a trainer hopefully because there are some root issues that need working on first** 

I’m a nurse. I used to get home from work and our dog would be by the door waiting because she got used to the time I’d be home. I’d then take her for a quick walk. She got used to it and it turned to a habit. I was working night shifts only pretty consistently until now.

My boyfriend refuses to wake up at night when she comes barking at our door and acts likes he is dead asleep or just point blank says no. I then have to wake up and do it.

Yesterday night I went to the bathroom as soon because I genuinely needed it but then she woke up and wanted to go for her walk. I could her my bf calling me but I stayed in bathroom a while longer to prompt him to get up and take her on walk because I have told him time and time again it’s unfair that I always have to do it. 

He did end up doing it but was pretty pissed off about it and said I created this issue and should deal with it to fix it.

AITA?",1
"I met this girl on Tinder and we really hit it off. I asked her out on a date to a cozy restaurant in our small town (Gainesville, FL). 

I had to take the bus there (my moped broke down last week which is another story of its own) and she lived close the restaurant so it was convenient. 

The date was going ok. It was kind of awkward at first because we just talked about the cold weather for 5 minutes -- so I decided to break the tension. A while ago, I heard about a life pro-tip where  if you order French fries at a restaurant  without salt, they have to make a fresh batch for you. I've been to this restaurant before and the guac is really good on some days and ok on other days. 

When the waitress came in, we ordered chips and guac. I then asked the waitress, ""Does the Guac have onions?"" To which she responded, ""Yes, it does"".  I then proceeded to tell her, ""I have an extremely severe allergy to onions, can we get guac with no onions?"" I told her I have an extremely severe allergy so she doesn't just take the guac they currently have and remove the onions; this forces them to make a fresh batch from scratch. After the waitress left, my date asked me, ""are you really allergic?"" To which I said ""no :D, but this way, we get fresh guac"". She was pretty impressed like ""damn, I'm stealing this one"". When the guac came in, I asked her to give us onions on the side for my date. 

The rest of the date went well. We ordered some drinks first and then food later. What I forgot to do when I was ordering food was to tell her not to put any onions in my food. When I got my dish, I took about 2-3 bites and the waitress came running to me frantically saying that there are onions in the food!! She thought it was her fault for not mentioning it to the chefs. I didnt know how to react so I just kind of dropped the food from my mouth and into the plate. Her superior walks in during this time and he's asking if everything is ok so I tell him that I forgot to mention not to put onions and that I have a severe allergy. 

The first thing the manager does is apologize profusely and then ask if he should call an ambulance.  

(Side note: I don't have any allergies at all and neither does anyone in my family or any of my friends. I have no idea what a severe allergic response looks like, but I know that it like swells up your face and for some reason, I thought it makes you cough a lot, I don't know why I thought that.) 

Cutscene to now: I start kind of coughing, but assure him that everything is going to be fine. I tell him, ""I barely got any onions in the bite"". My date at this time went from kind of giggling a bit (when the waitress came in) to just straight up serious after all the attention just turned to us. I told them not to worry about calling an ambulance, and that I'm okay enough to go to the emergency room myself. I asked for the check but they insisted on me not paying. (Not like we ate anyway) but I still left a $20 for the waitress and assured her and the manager that it was only my fault and not the waitresses fault at all. 

After leaving, my date was half-wtf and half-laughing at the stupidity of this whole thing. I shot my shot and asked her if she'd just like to grab pizza over at her place, but she said she has to study. Now it is important to note that the bus stop where I grab my bus to go home is RIGHT OPPOSITE THE RESTAURANT. I'm sitting there looking at cats fetching stuff on Reddit when the supervisor pulls up in his car at the stop. He thinks that I am taking the bus to the emergency room.  

He kept insisting that he drop me to the emergency room. He felt responsible and didnt want anything to happen to me. I finally gave up and told him , ""Okay"". In my head, I thought I'd just let him drop me there and then I'll take an uber back home. However, we get there AND HE WANTS TO COME IN TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OK.  I'm like hey man, trust me, IM OKAY. Nothing is going to happen to me. You can leave. It was so awkward. We were parked and he kept asking if I'm sure and I'm like yes I'm sure don't worry, please leave you dont have to come in with me. 

At the end he said he'd just walk me in, use the restroom and leave. We walk in the emergency room and I'm the only person there. Great. I had to walk to the nurse and tell her that I might be having a slight allergic reaction. Supervisor uses the restroom and asks again if everything is fine and I'm like yes, everything is going to be okay. ""Thank you so much for everything."" He gives me his number and tells me to inform him once I'm out. 

Here I am. A healthy 25 year old adult. Having to pay $500 to visit a fucking emergency room for no fucking reason: http://imgur.com/tfU3k5g
Another nurse came up to me to take my vitals and the doctor asked what was wrong and I had to sheepishly tell him, ""I think I might have been having an allergic reaction"". He says, ""Are you allergic to anything?"" And I go ""No"". 

He gave me a benadryl and sent me out. I then spent another $25 to Uber home. I told what happened to my friend and she said I was the worst kind of asshole. I learned my lesson and will never pretend to have an allergy, but I don't think I was an asshole because I did try to avoid as much confrontation as possible, and even ensured the waitress and supervisor that it was all my fault. Sorry for the long text, but AITA?

"I'll admit I'm biased right off the bat. I couldn't stand her.

I call her ""his ex"" to myself and others. He called her ""his friend"".

We're all in our early 40s. She died recently - aneurysm. 

I've been with him 10 years now, but he'd known her for 20+.

The way he tells it: They were friends in college, decided to date, got married, then realized they weren't a great couple and decided to just be friends. All that happened years before I met him. He was clear early on that she was ""important"". 

A couple months into dating, it came up that his *friend* was actually his *ex-wife*. He explained the above to me, saying she was one of his closest friends and that it was purely platonic. I expressed some discomfort at him being so close to an ex, and he told me ""That's fine. If you have a serious issue with it, let me know now and save us some time. I'll choose her. I like you and all, but I've known her for over 12 years and she's one of the most important people in my life. You'll have to be ok with that if you want us to be a thing."" 

When we were engaged I asked again. He gave me this perplexed look & asked ""Why would us getting married affect my friendships?""

I sucked it up & went along. I resented every moment of knowing her, especially when we had to be social. She understood some part of him I couldn't. Her husband was friends with mine as well, so it's not like I could use him as an angle.

He'd have lunch with the ex, they'd go to their geeky movies, and whatever. 

The few times I brought it up he said ""We had this conversation before. You had your chance to back out.""

She died after they had lunch the other day on the way to her car. He spent a bunch of time crying, but honestly I was relieved.

He was working with her husband on funeral planning. I told him ""You don't think you're going, do you?""

My argument, summed up: She's dead, so she's not a factor anymore. He doesn't get to use his ""she's my friend"" excuse since she doesn't exist anymore. He had his cry for a couple days, he gets to be done with mourning her already. There's no need for him to go to her funeral, since I wouldn't want her at his.

He was the angriest I've ever seen him when I told him that, replying that he'll be going no matter how I feel, and that he's ""willing to burn this to the fucking ground"" while holding up his wedding band. ""Besides you, she was the closest friend in my life.""

Him, her husband & my sisters are calling me an insensitive asshole over this, all saying that there was no romantic aspect to their relationship, & that I'm heartless. Her husband went so far as calling me a ""ghoul"" for how I've reacted.

I never felt their relationship was appropriate, and I hid that for years because I wanted to be  with my husband. Now that she's gone, I don't feel I should have to hide it anymore, and can speak freely. 

AITA for just wanting him to be *done* with her, and for him to not attend the funeral?",1
"I’ve been in a long term relationship for 7 years. My girlfriend doesn’t believe in marriage and has turned down the notion of me ever asking her, but for all intents and purposes we both plan on spending our lives with one another.

Gf is due to give birth in January 2020. I’m obviously over the moon excited, and can’t wait. First baby for both of us. 

Now, I’m sure I’m going to be laughed at on Reddit here, but I’m an incredibly squeamish guy. I believe this stems from when I was a kid, I threw up at camp and there was blood in it and some bullies rubbed my face in it holding me down in my own sick. 

Since then the smell or sight of blood makes me dead faint. I get sick, I get this weird numbness in my ass, I just for whatever reason can’t handle it. I literally pass out if I’m around blood. Many years of therapy later, I’ve just accepted blood is a no go for me. Even if I myself bleed, I have to look away from that shit straight away or I’ll end up throwing up. 

I’m ok handling it on tv etc but when I see it IRL I can smell it and taste it in my mouth and that’s where things get weird for me.  

So I explained to my gf that I’m with her for literally every step of the way but I don’t think I can be in the delivery room. Because she knows about the blood thing, I explained to her that that was my reasoning and that obviously I didn’t want to stress her out even more by throwing up or passing out, I especially don’t need medical attention on me during a time when all the attention needs to be on her. 

She became very defensive and said that I’m being an asshole for not even trying to enter the delivery room, and that I’m being selfish. I said that I know if I try and go in I’ll end up feeling unwell and that it’s better to just work around my limitations instead of me trying to be in there and then needing to be escorted out.

I spoke to my Gf’s mom because they’re best friends and she told me that I was basically not a man if I couldn’t handle going in there, so I’m feeling pretty upset and concerned over this because it’s not just me feeling light headed, it’s me actually blacking out 

~~AITA because I don’t want to compromise on this?~~

UPDATE: My girlfriend decided to read through these responses just out of curiosity. She’s changed her mind and told me it’s okay if I don’t want to be there, and also told me she loves me and we are completely cool. She also apologized on behalf of her mom since she wasn’t aware about her telling me to man up , which although was unnecessary was also completely appreciated. I’m the luckiest guy in the world and I’m v grateful that she changed her mind. I told her I’m gonna try and stick it through anyway but just knowing I have her blessing to wait outside is a great relief. Thanks for the ones who wished us well also. Y’all classy.

UPDATE II: some people are wondering how I plan on being a good parent if I pass out at blood. Others are demanding that I go to therapy. I’d like to point out that *I am still in therapy* for this issue (and have been for years) and my doctor feels that once I have my own child I will hopefully be able to deal with it without too much trouble. Apparently it’s exceedingly common and I’ve spoken to more than one qualified person who’ve told me a simplified version of ‘once your kid actually gets here it’s a different ballgame’. If anyone who has some knowledge of this wants to weigh in and explain better than me I’d be grateful. 

I’m getting a few pm’s that are becoming hostile so all I can tell ya is that I plan on being the best father possible and I’m gonna try my hardest *not to faint* if my kid ever skins a knee or gets a bleed.",1
"My girlfriend is a health care worker and an outdoors person. I have shared custody with my ex-wife, I have him week on week off. On one of the weeks that I have my child she decides to go hiking with a coworker. I've never met this person and I've only heard his name mentioned a couple times. He is a travel nurse not from around here. She knows so little about him that she doesn't even meet him at her home to drive to the hike they meet at a restaurant because she doesn't want him to know her address. The hike is about 45 minutes away. So they ride together and after the hike there's a lake and they go swimming. Then she text me that they're going to meet for dinner later. I did not get upset , but at that point I said this all seems kind of strange to me and that it feels like you're on a day long date. After a discussion I say that it's fine do your thing . She asked me if I'm going to hold it against her in the future etc I say no , she goes out to dinner and I do my thing. We chat again before bed and she's pretty mad at me for accusing her of cheating ,which I didn't do , and for insinuating that she would have any kind of relationship with this guy. To which I reply all I said is it seems like a date. We say good night and she ended up going to bed angry. That's where we sit. Other things to be noted, she says she never has and never will date at work but at the same time the hospital is sess pool of everybody fucking everybody.

Am I the asshole for sharing that this whole thing seems wierd to me and feels like she's dating another man? I'm at work so responses may not be quick.",1
"My wife has long lasting issues with her mother. She hasn't spoken to her in 6 years. To be frank I've never understood why my wife doesn't want her mother around. All I know is their relationship went south after my FIL divorced my MIL. It was a decision they both made so I don't get why she keeps punishing her mother like that.
I Was open to have meetings with my MIL.
I have been in contact with her for a year and my wife knew. She said It's up to me to want to have a relationship with her mom but I shouldn't try to make her re-establish a relationship with her. Things remained the same for months. My MIL would see my wife few times a week but they don't talk. and I just thought that my wife and MIL were stuck in this conflict and needed one meeting to at least open up to tackle this issue. Especially before our son is born.

I arranged for dinner at a restaurant on mother's day. My wife thought it was just 2 of us but I kept giving her hints about the person I was expecting. My MIL arrived and next thing I knew my wife got up from her seat and started yelling infront of everybody. I told her that her mom tried many times to reconcile but she was being unfair with her grudge holding attitude and not giving her a chance for a sincere talk. All I ask for was to sit down and talk things out with her mom.

She said she didn't want to see her especially on this day and thought I was doing this for her as a mom. And I was!. I begged her to sit and I'd get her mom to leave if she was bothered that much but she didn't listen, my MIL was standing behind crying while everyone was looking. My wife took her phone and purse then left. I had mixed feelings but I felt mostly upset things played out different than what I had in mind since my wife no problem with her mom speaking to me.

My wife has been staying with a friend for a week I visited her twice to talk and every time we ended up arguing. I told her she didn't need to cause a scene at the restaurant and could've been a little bit graceful to sit with her mom at the table to talk but she said I needed to blame myself. I asked her didn't mother's day mean anything to her? All I got was a cold stare

Growing up without my mother made my life incomplete. I never had any mother figures in my life and it's because of my father.
I just think everyone should count her their blessing and she should realize it's never too late to fix the problem between her and her mom if she chooses to see how lucky she was to still have her mom alive. But she kept blaming me for the scene at the restaurant and said she won't forget that day and flatout told me ""You know what's the worst thing about betrayal, it never comes from an enemy.""

This complicated the matter more. I thought about what went wrong and it's clear my wife isn't willing to even try.

Edit: I 23M.",1
"Earlier this year my child (20) came out as nonbinary to me and their father. I don't fully understand it and it's been hard to wrap our heads around it, but they promised to be patient with us as we took our time to process it.

Then yesterday they dropped a bombshell on us. They want to get breast removal. They assured us they were going to cover the cost of it, they only wanted our emotional support. But that's such a hard ask. It's such a permanent surgery, and it's might be something they regret later on down the line. I talked with them about it and spoke about maybe some other routes they could go down. They mentioned they had bought a binder as well, which I helped size them for, but they seemed very deadset on getting this surgery. I suggested body building, which is a pretty cheap alternative that might shrink their breasts, but they shot me down saying it wasn't an alternative for gender confirmation surgery, which I don't agree with since it can shrink breasts.

Ultimately i told them that this was a big ask and reminded them that when they came out earlier this year that this was going to be hard for their father and I to unconditionally support, and that we needed time. I made sure to stress that it didn't make their father and I love them any less, but they still left in tears, which makes me wonder if I said something wrong.

This is such a big decision, I just don't want them to regret it.

AITA?

ETA: you have all given me a lot to think about. I'll definitely be looking into arranging group therapy for the three of us, and I'll be looking into some reading for this. Thank you all for your comments.",1
"19 year old male here and I have had a issue that's been bothering me for a while. So I currently live at home and do remote college so I do the work on my own time and don't attend campus. So sometimes after I get up eat breakfast and start my college work my dad will ask me to go to dunking donuts for him, most of the time I just go but sometimes I didn't and instead decided to continue my college work. My dad would then get frustrated and almost mad at me because I didn't go to dunkin for him and says stuff like ""Really? You couldn't go to dunkin for me? I buy you a 30k car and yet you can't go to dunkin for me?"" And then usually later on after I do my college work for the day he will tell me ""alright then since you can't go to dunkin counts for me no electronics for you tonight"" it dosen't happen everytime but usually It does. I sometimes feel guilty for not going hence why I would be the a hole for not doing something so simple for my dad when he has done so much for me. But at the same time his behavior seems so childish and I'm taking sometimes 20 bucks out of my own money and a half hour out of my time just to shut him up with his coffee.",1
"I have been living with my new wife and stepdaughter for about 6 months now. She’s 19, almost 20, and I have three sons aged 18, 16 and 15. She’s a really good kid and she’s a good influence on my sons, I really enjoy having her around. My wife and her daughter moved into my house and sold theirs. My stepdaughters father isn’t present in her life, nor is my sons’ mother. All four children share a bathroom.

My sons have never lived for a long period of time with a woman, nor have any of them had long term girlfriends. They had short visitation periods when they were younger but never longer than an hour, so living with two women has been unusual for them. 

My eldest son, 18, came to me last week and told me that his stepsister disposes of her used sanitary products in the trash can they share, but doesn’t use toilet roll or sandwich bags to disguise what they are, and it makes him uncomfortable which I think is reasonable. My sons are teenage boys and don’t want to see their stepsisters period products on full display.

A few nights ago I went into the kitchen to grab a snack and she was there doing some work for university. My wife had mentioned that she knew she was on her period so I took it as an opportunity to have a word with her. I told her my sons were uncomfortable and asked her if she’d mind putting her used products in diaper bags or flushing them down the toilet. 

She laughed and told me it was rich coming from a man who “sheds like a gorilla” and has produced “three skid marking sons” which I thought was just an unnecessary attack. I’ve been nothing but nice to the girl and it’s hardly a comparison. My sons shouldn’t be subjected to her unhygienic products if it makes them uncomfortable. She went on to lecture me about how tampons can’t be flushed and that it’s bad for the environment if she uses diaper bags for every one which I think is just an excuse. I called her a scruff and told her that this was my house and that what I say goes. 

I later asked my wife if she could have a word with her and she told me I was being ridiculous and that her daughter has had her period for ten years and knows what she’s doing. When I told her it was making my sons uncomfortable she said my sons needed to get a grip and turned over and went to sleep. 

This is a genuine issue to me and she didn’t care enough to have a discussion about it. I asked my stepdaughter again in the morning and she did the same as her mother, completely dismissed it. Both of them have told me to stop being so silly but I don’t see how I’m being unreasonable when it makes my sons uncomfortable. AITA?

UPDATE — Not even two hours after I posted this, my wife and stepdaughter gathered my sons and I and gave us a full intensive “periods for pricks” course, Powerpoint and all. It was a hoot, they made an interactive quiz and everything. My sons and I learned a lot and apologised to my stepdaughter. Thankyou for your input",1
"Ok so breakdown of the situation, my partner and I both work but she leaves for work(hairdresser) at 7:30 i leave at 8:30 (Electrician). She gets up in the morning and usually heads to the gym and then comes home to get ready for work and I like to sleep in as I usually get home later and prefer to stay up a little later. 

So one morning she comes into the bedroom after she's gotten changed and asks me to make her some toast or something cause she's running late for work. Ive awoken but I don't usually get up for breakfast myself as I don't eat till first smoko, so basically I said ""umm surely you can make some toast yourself and not be any more late to work?"". She absolutely spat it and made me feel like an asshole for not getting up to help her, in which is a situation I feel she put herself in. She knows how long it takes to leave the gym, how long it takes to get ready ect and she could have put some toast in the toaster by the time she had asked me to do and more after the time it took to tell me off. 

Now now I get it, it would be the nice thing to do to get up and help my partner but it would also be the nice thing to not ask someone in bed to get up and make you food on a 5 degree morning. 

Am I the asshole?


UPDATE!!
So it's not a hands down YTA but it's definitely on that side, I can see that it's a nice thing I could have done to get up out of bed and make my partner some breakfast, as I stated, I'm not oblivious to this. 

But I still hold my position that it's something that she could have done herself in the same time as it took to ask me to do it (which isn't belittling her) and without disrupting a partners relaxation time. We run a pretty evenly run household where we are fair on the amount of chores and turn it is to cook, clean this and wash that. Plus I don't know where people are getting that I didn't do this before I had a smoke because I don't smoke nor did I mention it. I didn't do it because I was still tucked away in bed. That's the key part, in bed, if I was up and dressed no problem.

This was one of the times she's asked me to help when she's late for things (she's not late all the time but it wasn't a once off) and I usually do help, I'm not a complete dick but I do refuse when I've got my own things to do or when it's unreasonable. And don't worry people I do my fair share of other things to help my partner every day to make her feel special, just because I didn't make her toast once doesn't mean I don't deserve to be in a relationship so chill out and get off your moral high horses

So as stated I am the asshole but I believe I'm a reasonably fair asshole.",1
"I had a daughter 9 years ago. My girlfriend and I broke up before we knew she was pregnant and by the time my daughter was born she was dating another guy. He seemed like a nice guy and wanted to be in my daughters life and I wasn't interested in staying in her life so we all just agreed that it would be best if he would raise her instead however I didn't give up my rights because I was afraid I'd regret it some day.

I was right because as time passed I started to regret my decision and decided to meet my daughter and she wanted to meet me as well.

This has so far been the best decision I ever made. She is adorable and I love her so much. This summer I asked her mom if I could take her to a trip. ever since we returned from our trip my ex has been stopping me from seeing my daughter, always making excuses like she is busy with homework or she is not home now. 

Yesterday my daughter called me and angrily asked why I left again. I asked her what she means and she said that's what her mom told her.

I called her mom and blew up at her and asked her why she would say that to her and she started yelling at me and saying I made their life so much harder by ""being a disney dad"" because my daughter keeps comparing me and her stepdad and asks him why he doesn't play with her or take her to a trip and recently she has stopped calling him dad and then hung up the phone",1
"My girlfriend and I have are both in our early twenties and have been together for a year. I really love this girl and see a real future with her and I know she feels the same way about me. Our relationship has been almost picture perfect until now.

My girlfriend is a fairly successful amateur model. It’s been her dream forever to be a model and while she is not signed with a big agency yet, her career has advanced rapidly and she’s making a good amount of money. Recently, she’s been looking for a breakthrough. The other day, she got a great offer from an agency with a very generous amount of money. It was honestly the exact kind of breakthrough she was looking for. 

I, however, have a problem with it, because it’s a nude photoshoot. 

When my girlfriend approached me to talk about the offer I am ashamed to admit I didn’t react very well. I lashed out although later I felt kinda bad because she was so excited when she came up to tell me about it and I just wiped the happiness right off her face. 

Anyway, I told her this was something I was absolutely not okay with. She says in the beginning of our relationship I said I would always be supportive of her dreams. She vaguely mentioned how one of the things she really wanted to do was overcome her shyness and get into nude photography. At the time I just said yeah sure quickly because I hoped that if our relationship ever got serious she would give up those dreams and reorient herself. After that her career online started to take off rapidly and I put it from my mind.

When we cooled down we sat to have a discussion. She told me she had something to tell me that she’d always been shy to. I said okay, and she tells me that she’s always wanted to do softcore porn and nude photoshoots. She’s struggled with her body image for years but she says she loves her body now and wants to express herself and really hopes that I can accept that, and that nothing would make her happier. She assured me that she does not want to get into actual porn scenes or have sex with anyone other than me, and just wants to express herself in a way she knows will make her the happiest.

She said that it had always been her dream and that I promised I would accept all of her (I did say something like that when we were being gushy during the early part of our relationship but I wasn’t thinking of her going into porn at the time) and would always support her dreams. I told her it was a reasonable expectation that when you’re in a relationship with someone you are going to have to make some sacrifices, and yeah sometimes those things will have to be dreams, tough luck. I’ve given up my fair share for her too.

I told her under no circumstance would I ever consider being okay with this. She started crying and shut herself in our bedroom. A relationship is sexual exclusivity in every form. That’s what I believe, but I’m open to be proven wrong. So tell me, Reddit. Am I the asshole, or am I being reasonable?

EDIT: By soft porn I mean she wants to do photoshoots with other people where it looks like they're having sex. She won't actually have sex with them but they will be touching each other etc.

FINAL UPDATE: It turns out she's been posting to gone wild and real girls for almost a year. She says the asked if I was okay with it in the beginning because she wanted to start posting there. She says she went ahead because I said I was okay with it and that she planned to tell me eventually once she gained enough confidence in herself. I'm the first person irl to know apparently. In light of that, I will not be moving forward with this relationship. Thanks for all your comments.",1
"My (43M) niece (14F) is being raised by my wife (40F) and I - it’s a long story, having to do with my sister getting herself pregnant from a deadbeat and proving overall unfit to be a mother. Bottom line is, I see my niece as my daughter and love her just as much as my own biological children (11M/8M). I know my wife also loves her the same way, however I’m legally my niece's sole legal guardian.

My niece has practiced gymnastics for the past 10 years, and when she was about 7 or 8 one of the coaches at her gym took notice of her potential and suggested she could really make it as a professional athlete. I personally believe my wife and my niece/daughter were taken by this promise of future glory (“can you imagine if she competes in the Olympics one day?”, my wife said). I was always VERY cautious because I do realize the shots are slim; I also knew that could cost us a lot of money going forward, but the coach believed so much in her that they managed to cover some of the costs of her training on the gym’s dime.

And when I say training, I mean TRAINING – some serious hard work. I told them I was fine with the idea as long my niece was happy doing gymnastics and it didn’t majorly impact her life. And then, last month, she tore her ACL during practice. We do have insurance, so the medical costs were covered. However, she’s going through a painful recovery, all the while wondering when she’ll be healthy enough to get back to the gym. But I told my wife I don’t want her to do this anymore. Seeing her get hurt and in pain made me realize this is a dangerous sport, and the toll it's taking on her body is simply not worth it.

My wife said I couldn’t make this decision without considering what my niece wants; I said I can because I’m the adult here and she’s still a child. So my wife said there was still the matter of her disagreeing with my view, and that we were supposed to make this parenting decisions together. I then said that's true regarding our boys, but not when it comes to my niece. All I meant is that I'm the sole guardian in the sense of being responsible for her; what my wife got is that I was undermining her as a surrogate mother. AITA here?

Edit: some additional information, to be clear, I still haven't talked to my niece about this. I shared with my wife that, given the severity of her injury, I didn't want her training anymore. This discussion was between my wife and I, it didn't involve our girl so far.",1
"  

In high school, Anthony got into some bad stuff. Me and Sophia started getting involved, trying to help but ultimately enabling instead. Emma wasn't having any of it, she always stayed behind while the rest of us left to do whatever Anthony wanted to do

During all this we ended up leaving Emma behind, not listening to her, not taking her feelings into account, not even checking in to see how she was doing. I know I was the asshole here.

Eventually, after Anthony blew up at Emma, she rightfully decided she had enough, and ghosted us

We didn't hear from her for nine months. I feel awful about this, but for a while I didn't realize she was missing. (In my defense, me and Sophia tend to go dark sometimes, for weeks or even months, before coming back. We understand that sometimes we just need some space. I might have been dark at that time, or thought that's what Emma was doing, but I can't be sure.) Again, I was the asshole here

Once I realized she wasn't around, I tried texting and calling to try to get ahold of her. I even called her mom at one point to see if she was okay. Her mom said she would have Emma get in contact, but she never did. (I would later realize that both she and her mom had blocked me)

This was about nine months after her disappearance. Despite knowing what the answer was probably going to be, I decided to send her a letter along with some late holiday gifts. (I think it’s important to mention that my mom was the one who dropped it off.) To try to keep things casual, I pretended to not know what was wrong, and said none of the things I should have.

She didn't take kindly to it. She finally texted me back and in no uncertain terms told me to stop contacting her. She said it was borderline stalking

As of New Years, it’s been three years since we last saw her, and a little over two since that text, and it’s been eating me alive

So. AITA for sending my former best friend a letter nine months after she ghosted us despite knowing the reason she was gone and that she would say she didn’t want to be in contact anymore?

An additional question: WIBTA if I sent one more letter with a genuine apology? No guilt tripping or beating around the bush or over-explaining the reasons or begging her to give us another chance. Just a real apology. I really want to, but she told me not to contact her and I also don't want to disrespect those wishes. Though I feel like if I don’t, it’ll be one of the biggest regrets in my life. As I said before, it’s been three years since we last saw her, and I still think about her every single day. (On the one hand, three years feels like it might be enough time away for a letter to be potentially well received. On the other hand, it’s been three whole years. Could that be kind of creepy? After three years maybe it’s time to just let it go.) I’ve known her since first grade, it’s hard to just let go of almost ten years of friendship like that",1

"I work in a job where our office space is shared with a different company. So visualize one main lobby/reception area, but then turn left and you’re in the area where X Company employees work vs turn right and you’re in the area where Y Company employees work.

We share some office equipment (copier/printer/scanner) and occasionally borrow office supplies from each other. But each office has their own automatic postage machine, which is the source of the conflict in this post.

Yesterday our postage machine was broken and I needed to mail out a time-sensitive document. I went to the other side of the office to use their postage machine instead, and found it was passcode protected. I explained to Coworker at the other company that our machine was broken and asked, “Could I have the passcode to steal a few stamps from you guys?” She typed the code in for me, I printed my stamps, everything was good.

This morning, Coworker came to my desk to tell me that I had forgotten to fill out the form so her company could bill mine for the postage we had borrowed. I said, “Oh, I didn’t think I needed to. That’s why I asked if we could steal postage without doing the whole deal.”

(the whole deal: for the scanner, we use passcodes because each company account is billed separately. If we for some reason make a scan under the other company’s account, we reimburse them for it.)

She said, “I don’t know why you would assume that, but you can’t literally steal postage from us.” She said I could email her the form and then she left.

At some point today Coworker talked to my boss about it, and he sent a memo about the procedure for borrowing supplies from the other company. After getting the memo I’m now wondering if I actually made a big mistake here.  I thought it was a pretty innocent/reasonable misunderstanding until it was a big enough deal for her to go to my boss. It seems like she thinks I was trying to scam her or something, but I thought that using  $2 of postage was the kind of thing it was okay to let slide like borrowing a pack of staples, and I thought I had her permission.

AITA?

**EDIT:** I already filled out the reimbursement form when I was asked to.",1
"Back to school today and my eldest F10,  was dragging her heels. 15 minutes before we had to leave I asked her what she wanted for breakfast and she asked for a cereal bar.

We don't have any so I told her to pick or I'd choose for her. She ignored me and at 5 minutes to go I spread a slice of bread with some Nutella.

She started shrieking because she's now gone off nutella and I'm apparently super cruel but she was told to eat it or she's not going trick or treating. I'm now the worst mum ever apparently but at least she's got something in her belly before school.

Fwiw she normally has a couple of Weetabix before school but today she just messed about for an hour and a half with her lego.

So, AITA for giving her something to eat and resorting to threats when she refused?

Edit:

Ok so from what I've read I'm an asshole for putting Nutella on the bread which I agree shouldn't be a breakfast choice. Totally agree with those who said I overstepped by threatening to stop her trick or treating and have apologised at lunch to her for that and explained it was wrong of me.",1

She said it's ridiculous that I'm saying I trust reddit more than her for moral guidance? I said something along the lines of  ""well of course I do"". She then put phone down and isn't replying to my texts trying to explain what I said, obviously I’m not going to lie to her that a democracy of people on Reddit doesn’t have better morals than her. I texted a mutual friend who’s a girl and she thinks I’m in the wrong, but dunno what to think about that as I dunno what she thinks about vaccines. AITA?

"My husband and I live in an upstairs 3 bedroom flat and the flat below us is the same lay out. The house has been for sale for awhile and recently a woman bought it. It turns out she doesn't have any children so I found it strange she bought a 3 bedroom house but I soon found out it's because she runs a craft business from home and needs 2 bedrooms to run it. The problem is unfortunately she has decided to use to main bedroom, which is below us as her main craft room. 

At first it was fine as she hadn't fully moved in but now it's driving me crazy. She's in that room almost all day and I can hear her walking about and the faint noise of machines. I don't spend long in my bedroom during the day but when I do go in it just annoys me knowing she's there constantly. Like why can't she have picked the smaller bedrooms since she knows the kids are at school all day? She always stops using her embroidery and sewing machines by 7pm but she's told me she can sit up until 10pm some nights finishing off orders which plays on my mind. I go to bed at 9pm and I can't sleep for hours as I lie there listening for her every move. Just knowing she's awake and walking about drives me crazy as I find it so selfish someone would buy a flat and work from home. 

My husband says he can barely hear a thing during the day and I need to calm down. He also doesn't see the big deal about her using her house as she pleases. Yesterday I finally had enough and went to her door. I told her how I was feeling about everything and how I can hear the faint noise of her machines. She apologized and invited me inside to show me her set up. All her machines are on some sort of anti vibration padding to stop as much noise as possible so she claims the noise should be minimal and that you need to expect some noise from neighbours. I told her I don't make any noise and that's when things took a turn as she said she can hear my kids running around and jumping off furniture all evening but she would never dream of complaining because it's just one of those things when you share a building with other people. I left before I said anything else I regretted and I thought that was the end of it but today my husband came home from working overnight and asked if I had said anything to the woman downstairs as she was very cold and blunt with him when he said hello. I told him what happened and he said I'm a massive asshole. I've spoken to a couple of my friends who think I've handled this completely wrong and I'm a bit of an asshole for it but I don't see what else I could have done",1
"I’m 18F, I’ve got a sibling who’s a few months old now.

My parents (37F and 42M) separated 9 months ago, for 2 months then got back together and permanently separated 3 months ago.

My parents were each others first relationship, something I’ve overheard my dad complaining about.

A while ago we went through a tough period, my mother got pregnant and 5 months in miscarried, a month later it turned out that my dad had been having an affair - my parents tried to work it out, found out the AP was pregnant and that was the end of it.

When they separated my dad wanted to make it work, so when my mother said she was moving into grandmas (7 hours away) dad asked if I’d live with him, thinking it’d bring mum home.

Mum begged me to go with her, I didn’t I believed it was best because a) school/friends and I did believe my parents could work through it.

They didn’t, dads new girlfriend and baby moved in (new girlfriend is pretty cool actually) so I guess mum found out because she texted me; “**it breaks my heart you picked sides, you could’ve visited me or even texted but you haven’t…I love you, but you’ve behaved selfishly**”

I texted back asking if she expected me to move away from friends/family/school, my dad didn’t cheat on me! And they could’ve moved past it because it was only because they were going through a hard time.

No response, I think I’ve been blocked.

I didn’t text because I haven’t been able to pay my phone bill.

AITA? I don’t think I am.",1
"**TL;DR in bold**

A close friend (24M) has disappointed and hurt me (30M) a few times now:

* He **forgot/didn't follow through on plans** that he himself came up with a **few times now**.
* He **lied to me about something** I spent hours giving him advice on (after he came to me for advice)
* He **forgot about my birthday**, despite talking up big game twice (""Just you wait - when your birthday comes, I'll impress you!"").

**We've had a few talks over this already, so he knows how I feel.**

Today, he dropped off a **surprise gift of scented body wash**. He apologized for not being very responsive these days (historically one of our issues) and apologized that it's now too late for my birthday (since it's been a month), so it's a housewarming gift instead. **He included a tiny handwritten card and sealed it with something he bought during our last hangout.**

The body wash is not really my thing. **He loves this brand, but I'm not into this brand or scented products in general, which I've mentioned a few times now** (we've talked about handsoap, lotions, deodorant). I'm ok with this scent, but **I feel his gift to me shows he doesn't listen and that he doesn't really know me after all**.

**I also feel hurt knowing that the only gift I ever received from him cost $100 but my gift to him was $400 from his favorite brand** (which he knows, plus I've given him other gifts since then). He's complained before that **he's gifted 2 others $300 each and it hurt him when they split $150 to gift him back**, so this felt ironic. I feel shallow talking about money; **it's not really about $ but the gift as a whole reflects how I feel undervalued as a friend**.

**When we talked about him forgetting about my birthday, I mentioned that what I was really looking forward to (but never got) was the letter he said he would write me** (we joked about how he had 3 months to write mine). The card that came with the gift today had a few sentences of appreciation, but it was understandably quite short given how tiny the card is. **I also told him before that what I want from him is quality time and following through, not material gifts. He cancelled plans again last week, and although I was understanding about it, we have yet to make any new plans even though he has said he would get back to me.**

**I thanked him for the gift anyway.** To his credit, **I knew for weeks now that he was going to be very busy this past weekend, and yet he bought the gift last Saturday, which shows he is putting in extra effort.** As usual, he meant well, but the gift still tapped into some of my resentment.

**If they ask me about the gift, would I be the ungrateful asshole if I told them the truth?**",1
"Older Sister - “Brooke”, 32 F
Fiancé - “Mark”, 32 M
Me - no nickname necessary, 25 F
Younger Sister - “Jenny”, 22 F

My sister, call her Brooke, has been together with Mark since freshman year of high school. As far as I understand it, they did not want to get married initially because Brooke is vehemently child-free, and Mark agrees with her, but they have decided to hold a wedding/commitment ceremony next spring after a lot of years of back and forth. The problem is, I’ve known Mark since I was a kid (he started coming around to the house a lot when he and Brooke were sophomores in high school, so I was eight or so when I first met him as Brooke’s boyfriend, and I have basically hated him the whole time. I’ve tried to be polite, particularly now that we are all adults, but I just don’t want to go to the wedding of my sister and the guy she’s always put before her family. 

As an example, when Brooke and Mark started dating, Brooke went from eating dinner at home with the rest of us every night to going out two or three times a week with Mark and his friends. This was against our parent’s rules, and caused a lot of arguments that negatively impacted both me and our younger sister Jenny (who was barely in kindergarten at the time and didn’t understand what was going on). 

Brooke and our parents started fighting basically every night, and it was incredibly disruptive to our home life. My sister went from being my best friend to a stranger, and Mark was the one encouraging it. 

The stress of those years was so bad that I had to repeat fourth grade (failed math), and I was bullied really badly for that. I stopped going to school looking nice because there was so much tension in the home that no one was paying attention to whether or not I had clean clothes. Jenny also struggled academically and socially but I was able to step in and help her more with things like getting dressed and packing her lunch, so she doesn’t remember those years as negatively as I do. 

Of course, as soon as Brooke and Mark graduated he convinced her to move across the country to go to college. Our parents were really hurt by this and there were a few years where she didn’t come home over Christmas or summers. Eventually things cooled down when I was in high school and Brooke started making more contact with our family, but Mark would do things like glare at our parents over the dinner table and suddenly declare that it was time for them to go. 

I don’t think I should have to go to the wedding of my sister and this guy that stole her from us, and I am planning on RSVP-ing “no” when the time comes. Our family has been minimally involved in wedding planning, and I am not in the bridal party or anything like that (they are all friends of Brooke and Mark’s from the hospital where they work).

WIBTA?

Edit: I am getting a lot of feedback that Brooke was potentially parentified. If anyone has recommendations for podcasts or books about that, I would appreciate it. I think I need to learn more about her experiences before I decide about the wedding, since we did use to be close and it would be unfortunate to lose the relationship entirely (which is what some commenters think will happen if I skip the wedding). Thank you.

Edit 2: Please stop attacking my parents. They have their faults but they did not have many resources when we were young. It’s important to me to support them now that they are older and can’t work but I also want to support Brooke and understand better now that I have not been handling this in a mature way. I will be apologizing to her and asking for more of her perspective on things from our childhood. I’m going to stop reading now but I appreciate your help. Thank you.",1
"Background: We have three children. We live in a beautiful but modestly sized four-bedroom condo in an expensive city.

Our oldest daughter went away to college this year. The family decided that it would be best to turn her room into an office, as me and my husband have been working from home since March and it has been difficult for us to balance our time. We told our daughter and told her to take all of her important possessions with her to college. We warned her that we may throw out anything she didn't take with her and she understood.

After she went away to college we went through and did a makeover of her room. We kept a few momentos and clothing items that seemed nice but for the most part we cleared it out. We have moved some storage into her closet and the rest of the house is less cluttered now. Overall though the room is much nicer now and has been far more productive as a workspace for me and my husband to retreat to. Our other two children also occasionally use it for school and studying.

She came home for the first time for Christmas break and cried when she saw the room. It strikes me as overdramatic **because it is still her room to** ***exclusively*** **use whenever she is home** \- we have a futon that converts into a bed for her and we don't use it as an office when she is here. She also has said that we threw out too many things but frankly she's a packrat. It was all clutter: we threw out clothes she hasn't worn in years, old boxes and packages, old diaries from years ago, even homework assignments and random old books from as far back as middle school. She says this was cruel but it was not important stuff and we told her in advance to take anything important with her. Her mood has been sour and rude this whole break and I'm starting to wish she would go back to college already. AITA?",1
"My (21F) step-brother ""Joseph"" (22M) is home from college. Originally his plan was to stay with us for a night and then stay with his friend for most of the break except for Christmas Eve and Christmas. Joseph was helping his dad replace a second-story window on our house the other day and fell, got a concussion and broke his elbow. He had a quick surgery to put in some pins or whatever. My mom asked me to clear out my second room (his old room) since he would be staying a little longer than planned. I cleared off the bed and then went to visit with my friend. When our parents got back with Joseph they got mad that the room wasn't in good enough conditions for his high standards I guess. I came back and cleaned up more of the room.

Yesterday he just laid around in the room all day and to my knowledge didn't need much. My step-dad had to work and my mom had to leave for a couple of hours to pick up my grandparents from the airport and take them home. They told me to ""watch after Joseph"" as if he's a child. When they left, I peeked into his room and he was asleep.

I went to go see my friend again I left his meds, a cup of water, and a note saying where I was and to call me if he needed anything otherwise I'd be back a little later. I meant to only be gone for an hour or so but you know what happens when friends get to talking and catching up. Plus this was going to be the last time I'd get to see her because she's going out of town with her family for two weeks then back to school and our first visit already got interrupted.

Well, to my surprise, my mom brought my grandparents back to the house so they could eat a quick dinner before driving them the rest of the way to their house. She called me upset and told me to get home. Later when she got back again and Joseph's dad got home they lectured me about trust and irresponsibility going so far as to say I was a selfish brat for leaving when they told me not to. My argument back was that Joseph slept through everything and was fine. Besides that, while yes I get he's hurt, he's a grown ass adult and can take care of himself and he could have called me if he needed something. I wasn't far away. And they didn't even tell me not to leave, they just said to watch after him. That doesn't require me to hover by his bedside for hours.

A day later and my mom has come around but my step-dad is still angry. He made the decision to take a sick day today so he could stay home but now he's blaming me for that even though it was his choice. I told him he didn't have to because I didn't have any plans but all he says is ""that's not the point.""

AITA or who is the AH?

ETA: I’m an AH and am not empathetic. I’m just not. That said I did apologize. I also made it known that I don’t feel I should be made to take care of him. He’s not my brother so I don’t feel like I have to help him in the bathroom or anything, that’s just wrong. Anyway they agreed to not put that on me anymore.",1
"Hey Reddit,

So, it's my wife's birthday tomorrow and we have plans for a nice meal in the afternoon and entertainment in the evening. I took the day off work to spend quality time with her. However, I also wanted to squeeze in some morning tennis at my local club.

My wife is upset about my decision to play tennis on her birthday, saying I should be fully focused on her special day.",1
"We've got a troubled history with the church. My dad used to be a missionary, dragged us all over the country because of that (while cheating on my mum at every stop). Me and my brother are both queer, with every problem that being a LGBTQIA+ kid in an evangelical church conceives. I became an angry atheist, not preachy but very strongly opinionated against organized religion, and after my mum found out of my dad's cheating and got divorced, we stayed away from church for the better part of 15 years. I'm currently 32(m), my brother is 29 and our mum is 51.

Mum remarried and adopted another child, a little girl that is currently the best specimen of human being on this planet. I found out maybe 3 months ago that my mum is not only going to church again, but also taking my little sister with her, and that's been going on for a year. She has been careful not to mention that to me because she knows I'd struggle with accepting not only her going back (I'm aware I've no right to have a say on that) but most importantly her taking my 4yo sister with her (I know it's not my decision to make either, but I worry about her a lot. I suffered a lot in church being coded male, so I can only imagine how much crap she'd have to endure hearing being a girl in church).

Last night I brought the subject up. I told her that it made me sad that she was not only going but also taking my sister to that nasty place, that being in church during childhood brought about a diverse range of trauma to both me and my brother (which she knows all about and is deciding to ignore by going to church again), and that she was exposing my sister to terrible political views, ethical stances, and a real risk of harassment. She answered I was arrogant like my father (that hurt A LOT), that her youth in church was the best thing that happened and she wanted the same for me, my brother and now for our sister, that I don't know the church she's going to and it's very different from the places we attended when I was a kid. 

I think I've exhausted and maybe even overreached my options. Talking to her leads to shouting matches (we're both very sanguine, let's put it that way). And also, I know I'm not my sister's parent and I've no right to demand anything. Likewise, I know I can't decide for my mother that she's not going anymore. I'd like to at least convince her to not take my sister with her, but after last night I don't think I have the energy to keep fighting this front. It's just very sad to see my mum placing herself in that position again - it's like seeing someone you know that has a drug problem having a relapse.

"I (23F) have an 11 year old dog that can be pretty difficult to take care of (he's blind, hard of hearing, and diabetic among other things) but I have always been able to make it work. He lives a pretty happy life minus the few health we occasionally come across. I have always prided myself on taking good care of him. Recently, one of my friends and I both moved into a house that doesn't have a fenced-in yard, but that's never been a problem with my dog. He never strays very far from the house and even if he does, I am usually outside with him, especially since sometimes he takes naps in the yard and is disoriented when he wakes up. He had gotten lost and ended up in someone else's yard only once before.  
  
Cut to about a week ago. I go inside for about three minutes to go to the bathroom and refill my water bottle. When I go back outside my dog is gone. I start frantically searching the yard, messaging my roommate, etc. I was also panicking because holy fuck this dog can NOT go without his insulin. I can't sleep that night, but the next day my roommate tells me that she had posted on a neighborhood app and learned that he was okay (albeit a little sick) and in the care of our next door neighbor. I walk over and pick him up, thank the man (let's call him Craig) that answers the door, and apologize.  
  
A few days later, it happens again. I make the assumption that my dog had probably dug a hole under Craig's fence (it's a privacy fence for later context) when I wasn't looking and make two decisions: I will not take my eyes off of him even if I have to go to the bathroom and I will buy one of those hidden fences, an option that had completely slipped my mind at first. This works for another few days as I get the fence installed and it's working beautifully.  
  
Last night, my dog disappeared again. I looked away for less than a minute. He had been on the complete opposite side of the yard from Craig's fence. Still, I head immediately for his house and knock on his door to check if he is there, because it's impossible to tell with the fence. This time a woman answers. She claims that my dog isn't there, so I start to look elsewhere.  
  
About an hour ago, I got him back again. He had, apparently, been in Craig's care the whole time, despite who I assume is his wife telling me that he was not over there. Craig screams at me about how I'm a piece of shit, and that my dog was ""dying in his yard all night"" and I had ""no mind to check in with them"" and that I don't deserve my dog. My dog was clearly extremely unwell and covered in his own feces, so I didn't take the time to ask anymore questions or even reply at all and just took him to the vet. We just got back. He has all of his medicine and is currently resting. I'm still really worried because he seems really sick, and there isn't much else I can do at the moment besides give him love and keep an eye out.  
  
I find the whole situation fishy, but at the same time, is Craig right and I'm really just a bad owner? AITA?",1
"I (m35) have a 16 year old daughter. I’ve been a single father since she was about 3 years old as I got sole legal custody due to some addiction issues her mother has. We have a really good relationship, but I always worry about her not having a woman to talk to. 

Over the past few months she hasn’t really seemed to be herself, I know she went through a bad break up but I’ve been worried it’s more than that. I’ve tried talking to her, and my sister only lives down the street so she’s tried talking to her also, but my daughter is really keeping to herself and it concerns me. 

She went out to see her friends for the first time since quarantine started yesterday and asked me if I could give her room a quick tidy whilst she was gone. I agreed because she does a lot of chores but she’s not good at cleaning her room. Whilst I was putting clothes back in her closet, I stumbled upon what I now know to be her diary. 

I shouldn’t have read past the first page but I just wanted to know if there was anything going on she wasn’t telling me about. There were some pretty heartbreaking stuff for a father to read about how down she felt about herself, so when she got home I brought it up to her. 

She asked me why this was suddenly coming up and when I told her I’d read her diary she absolutely flipped and told me it was an absolute violation of privacy and she’s completely humiliated. I told her I was just trying to protect her and she said it was none of my business and locked herself in her bedroom and hasn’t spoken to me since. AITA?",1
"  

The title sounds extreme but here are the details. My wife and I have been together for 5 years. I love her so much that it pains me to write this. The thing is, I was the sole earner for a while and I was happy to provide (I am a software developer at a local startup that has tripled in employees and gone exponential in revenue). We're not having kids, so my wife got bored of being home and doing nothing. So she got a job at a law firm as a paralegal. 

Enter this attorney, who I'll call Brandon. My wife started to bring him up quite a bit. You know when your wife starts talking about something, drops it, and then brings it up again a few minutes or hours later like there was no gap? My wife does that with stories about him. I searched through her Facebook friends list one day for ""Brandon"" and saw that they had connected. Okay... Then my wife starts going to work happy hours and I'm seeing pictures of the guy on her timeline. In most of the pictures she is positioned next to him, holding a drink. Okay...

I have gained considerable weight since joining the startup. There is free food provided to us nearly every day. My wife has maintained a really low weight and looks as beautiful as she did at 22. Brandon is more like how I used to be weight wise. However, I believe I make more money than he does.

So here it goes... I take off work on Friday, as my team is nearing the end of our project. I wait for my wife to leave the firm and I see her walking out with Brandon. They get in my wife's car, purchased on my dime, and I follow them for a bit. They go to a local dive bar and it turns out all of her coworkers are there - I see them entering. I wait for hours and everyone eventually leaves. My wife leaves last with Brandon and she takes him home. I don't see any physical contact as he exits the vehicle to go inside his apartment building.

At this point, I'm sick. I'm gutted. I wait at home for my wife and confront her about Brandon. She went insane basically, threatening to end the marriage because I stalked her. She told me she is always the DD for happy hour because she doesn't drink much (which is true), but she didn't address my greater concerns. AITA?

 

TL;DR Followed my wife one evening because of her weird relationship with an attorney at the firm she joined",1
"I (M26) am a second generation French immigrant to the US. I speak French and most of my family lives in France, so I try to make a trip back to France once or twice a year.

I have been dating an American girl (F24) for two years now. My girlfriend does not speak French at all. The actual events in question happened this winter.

I usually go to France around Christmas time. The most recent Christmas, my girlfriend wanted to come with me. I said sure as she had never been to France before and we'd been dating almost two years so it seemed reasonable. 

My family comes from the South West, but I also have family in Paris so we stopped in Paris first. My gf wanted to eat at a fancy French restaurant while we were there, something with Michelin stars. Expensive, but not really a problem since I make pretty good money.

We made a reservation for a good restaurant, not the best but still good. We had to make it months in advance because it's a restaurant that's high in demand. As a very upscale restaurant, there was also a dress code and things like that.

We showed up and everything was fine at first. They took our coats, we sat down, the restaurant was beautiful, etc. The waiter then gave us our menu. I had to do all the communication as my gf doesn't speak French.

I was showing my gf something on my menu and she noticed that mine had prices and hers didn't. I had completely forgotten about this tradition because it's just not common at all in the US.

She asked me why mine had prices but not hers. I explained to her that it was just a tradition in many upscale French restaurants. She called it sexist and said it was ridiculous. I told her that it's just the way it is in these kinds of places, and that we shouldn't have come here if she was upset by this.

She wanted me to ask for a menu with prices for her. I refused because we already had the prices and I didn't want to make a scene. She demanded that I confront a waiter about it or she would walk out. I called her bluff and she ended up staying, but didn't talk to me for the whole meal, which was delicious by the way.

We've been back home for several months but she keeps bringing it up. I'm honestly considering ending the relationship over this because she will not stop talking about. She keeps accusing me of being sexist (I'm not) and has been making ridiculous comparisons.

AITA?",1
"My grandma and I have always been close. I love her a lot. When she got cancer after I graduated from college, I spent 2 years during quarantine taking care of her instead of going to medical school like I had planned. It led to my ex-bf breaking up with me because I was depressed and also not going back to school with him.

My grandma never understood my sexuality. She was the only one who had a problem with it and when I came out in high school she didn't speak to me for years. But she ended up reaching out and apologizing and our relationship is stronger than it ever was now. She told me she was upset because she comes from a different age. All she knew about gay people was bloody pictures in newspapers and Sunday afternoon gossip. She was *worried* about me. I forgave her.

I started dating my current boyfriend after my grandma went into remission and didn't need to be taken care of anymore. The issue we're having is my grandma is still adjusting to the gay relationship thing. She didn’t see me actually interact with ex-boyfriend, so it’s all new for her. 

He came over for dinner last night and called me babe at one point. My grandma sort of grimaced, just did not look happy about hearing that. My BF immediately said, “What?” She goes, “It’s just weird to hear another man call my grandson babe.” 

I could tell he was pissed. said, “What’s weird about that? We’re two consenting adults, aren’t we?” I said, “She’s still getting use to the idea. Let’s just move on from this.” I was trying to keep the peace.

He basically said there shouldn’t be anything to get use get use to. ""What is there to look so disgusted about?” She just said she was from a different age. I tried to change the subject again, but my bf snapped something like seriously, he looked after you for years when you had cancer and you can't get the fuck over the gay thing?

It was bad. After dinner my BF basically said I was a coward for not standing up for them, for letting my grandma make those faces and those passive aggressive comments about our relationship. He doesn't like that I didn't say anything.

But I didn't want to put a strain on my relationship with her, my closest family member. He doesn’t get that we worked for years after to understand each other. Yes, she has said things that made me feel like shit. Yes, her being unhappy and making upset faces at dinner made me feel like shit. But when you really love someone, you accept them, all of them. I accepted her, even the parts of her that needed growing, and she worked really hard to learn how to accept me. She was still working on that. She was trying. Having my BF over for dinner was a big improvement, a big step for her, and of course it wasn’t going to be perfect right out of the gate. I wish he wouldn’t be so aggressive about it and was more understanding. But he is convinced I should have stood up for them. 

AITA? I have never loved anyone like this. I don't want to upset him.",1
"First Reddit post and I’m on mobile, so sorry if the formatting is weird. For context I’ve been  meaning to get a cat for awhile, and my brother has cat allergies and asthma. 

He is rarely home, so I thought it wouldn’t be an issue, (like he leaves around 6 am then comes back at 10/11 pm, or if he comes home briefly for a meeting or something it’s usually for an hour or so.) I am at home all day (since I do online school) and never go out, other than for appointments and don’t have that many friends/talk to them a lot so the boredom is really getting to me. 

I have offered solutions as to buying these really expensive air purifiers, and this expensive brand of dry cat food that claims to reduce allergens, but to of no avail. I also can’t just move out because I am a minor but my brother is 21. Would I be the asshole if I got it regardless?",1
"My daughter, 19, and I , 40 F, live together.  She is in online college, so home all the time. 

We are total opposites. I am a girly girl, she is a sweats and throw hair up in a bun type. She is into anime,  which I tried to watch with her but it's the most annoying thing ever. She also loves comics, so I did learn about them when she was younger. Basics, like Supergirl and Superman are cousins, etc. So we sort of talk about that, but it's hard because she knows so much and I don't.  I used to do a mother daughter book club with her, but she she kinda didn't want to do that when she was in high school.  

So, the other day, she said she wanted to talk. She said she was upset that we "" didn't have a mother daughter bond"" I told her I love her very much, and am sorry she feels like that. She said other mothers are super close to their daughters and I pointed out that they have common interests, do spa days,  make up together, etc, and we don't have that much in common.  She started crying and won't talk to me. My ex called and yelled at me, saying I'm a horrible person. He takes her to fix furnaces and stuff, and suggested I do stuff like that, and I told him I barely know what a furnace looks like and can barely use a hammer so it's a bit hard to bond over home improvement.  My cousin also called and yelled at me. I feel bad but I have tried, and do love her and support her, so I'm not sure what else I can do. AITA?

Edit: I finally got her to talk to me. I suggested some of the Anime you guys recommended and said I was willing to try, and she loves the idea of it. I suggested I read up on anime and suggest ones we can try, and I guess we are going to read a graphic novel called Locke and Key, since she likes the show and I like the author. Thanks everyone ! ( Also, she is going to let me try a modified Harly Quinn makeup look on her, one that you feasibly wear in public )",1
"So I (22m) was on a trip with a few of my friends, both guys and girls. One of the guys (“Alex”) brought his new girlfriend (“Beth”). Since we only got two hotel rooms to save money, even though Alex and Beth are a couple, the guys slept in one room and the girls slept in another. 

So we were checking out of the hotel and I noticed a pair of underwear on the floor. Not wanting someone to leave them behind (and since they were folded, I assumed they were clean lmao) I put them in a (non-transparent) bag and brought them downstairs. 

Here’s where I might be the asshole. Everyone was in the lobby and I told Alex he left a pair of underwear in the room and tossed him the bag. One of our friends jokingly pointed out how it was suspicious I recognized Alex’s underwear. We all laughed and then I said I knew it was Alex’s because he’s the only one of us who still wore boxers. The group all chuckled and the guys made a few jokes. I noticed Alex wasn’t laughing and quickly changed the subject. 

The rest of the trip home Alex was very distant towards me. I’m wondering if I was the asshole for saying that, especially in front of a new girlfriend. But I also don’t want to make things even more awkward by bringing it up again to apologize.",1
"I (46M) have twin girls, Pam and Abby, who are turning 15 in July. My wife (44F) and I have been planning their parties with them for the past few months.

On Saturday, it was Milan, my SIL’s son’s (nephew) birthday party, he turned 13 around a week and a half prior. Milan is a good boy and absolutely loves working with kids, which has recently led him to babysitting and trying to get involved in coaching and refereeing younger kids sports. Milan has talked about wanting a large family and wanting to help kids, all of that good stuff.

Milan is also very quick to pick up on things, smart kid, and he’s on a travel baseball team. Some of the areas that my SIL and her husband have passed through wile diving Milan have been pretty poor and Milan has asked his parents and others about this and looked it up on TikTok. The area we live in is very wealthy and Milan was confused at what we saw, I’ve even driven Milan to a few games as I have a flexible work from home schedule while my SIL and her husband often have corporate meetings they can’t miss.

Milan has asked me a few of these questions about different areas to, sometimes things as simple as why the buildings look “so strange”. Apparently through TikTok, Milan has learned about some sports charities that help kids in poorer areas and stuff like sports for disabled people charities. At his birthday party, Milan had a place where people could donate, either physically or an online link to a few of these charities. As I’ve mentioned the area is affluent so a lot of people wouldn’t mind giving some money. Milan still got plenty of gifts and cards.

In the car ride home, my wife and I heard Pam and Abby giggling in the back, so we decided to ask them what they were looking at (we thought it’d just be some TikTok or meme), they were laughing at the charity stuff set up at Milan’s birthday saying that it showed how Milan is just one of the “cringe” members of Gen Z and saying he should stop worrying about other people’s lives and just focus on his own. They said he’s too sensitive and that the charity stuff “probably wouldn’t do any good”. When we told them to stop we were just told to calm down. 

When we got home, my wife and I went in our room to discuss what they were saying. We agreed that there should be some sort of punishment for it, we agreed that their allowance should go to the charities Milan was trying to support and told them instead of getting their normal allowance they’d have to do chores to earn some and said until they’ve each raised $300 that they can’t have their birthday party (it’s separate parties) and we made sure they can reach that by July.

Our daughters are furious at us and have been sending messages on Instagram to their cousins (including Milan) complaining about us so now we’re hearing from family about it. AITA?",1
"I am an assistant professor at a university with an office on the ninth floor of a building. I hold regular meetings with graduate assistants, and they are expected to attend unless they have a really good excuse. Failure to attend results in less involvement in research projects. This system is common here, and I must abide by it to maintain the respect of my department. 

Today, unfortunately, the elevator is out of order. My assistant had surgery three weeks ago and has a brace. She asked if we could meet in a lower floor communal area. There are people who walk in and out of there, and I feel like it would be too distracting. I told her that meetings are always in my office, as planned, and unless she had a statement from a physician that she could not go up the stairs, I would not change the location or cancel the meeting. I have no doubt that she can make it up the stairs, it would just take her longer than usual. She could arrive at the building earlier.

Apparently she complained to the department head. I talked to her (the head), and she said that it is my right to hold meetings wherever I find them appropriate. However, she also said, and I quote, ""it seems like a dick move."" I was taken aback at the inappropriate language from my head, and I am considering filing a complaint against her with the ombudsman. Sounds like someone who will seek retaliation if she is so quick to make gender-based slurs against people. I do not think I will file a Title IX claim against her, but that is not off the table. I told her I did not appreciate her words, and she said, ""Just consider what I said. You can require the meeting where you would like."" 

I did require it in my office. My assistant made it up. She did not seem to be in any more pain as normal. We had the meeting. I reminded her that I allowed her three weeks off of meetings, which is a big deal to me. I expected her next week whether or not the elevator is repaired. This is an inconvenience to me, as well. I am not a big fan of walking up nine flights of stairs in dress shoes, but I have to do it. 

A colleague of mine told me he would have just met her downstairs, but he did not think I made a ""dick move."" Another colleague told me that she would have never done what I did. I feel like they might be talking about me behind my back. Hopefully it is not the department head spreading rumors, but I will surely find out. 

I would like your opinions on my behavior but also on the behavior of my department head, as I think most would agree that even if what I did was unconventional, what she did was much worse. Thank you in advance.",1
"This isn't a crazy one, but it's bugging me and I'd like some outside opinions. 

So, some backstory first: I (26m) am currently writing a book; a sci-fi adventure story about a party of young explorers with special abilities going on an adventure kind of thing. Sounds pretty cliche', I know, but i have my own unique spin on it, with unique and interesting characters with backstories and everything. I've been at it for about 5 years now, and I think I'm in the final stages before looking into getting it published. 

I'm still new at the whole author thing, so I've been asking my gf (23f) to take a look at it and tell me what she thinks. I've been asking since I finished the first draft about a year ago, and since then the responses have evolved to get more and more uninterested. First, it was ""I'll read it when I have time,"" then it was ""I know, I know. I promise I'll get to it eventually,"" and now we've gotten to, ""I don't know. Reading's just not my thing."" 

Now, don't misunderstand. I try not to be too pushy with it. I just ask her gently from time to time, primarily while I'm actively editing it and have it in front of me. 

One of the frustrating things about this is that I KNOW she loves to read. She's got a bookshelf full of books, and 13 different reading apps on her phone. She's CONSTANTLY on her phone and reading different stories, many of them are of similar material to what I have created, so I know she would at least like the premise. I even made a Google-Drive version she could just open up and scroll through on her phone if it would make things easier. Still, she won't even look at it. It kind of hurts.

The other thing, and this is where I kind of feel like an asshole, is that I feel like she should do this, for me. I know she's her own person, but is it really that unreasonable to ask for this one favor as her bf? I've been working on this for 5 years, and she knows full-well how much it means to me. I just want her to take a look and tell me it's not horrible. To see something that I've dedicated so much time and effort toward and tell me if it was all worth it.

Yesterday, I asked her again but differently; more bluntly this time. I began with the usual jab after she told me she was bored and was trying to find something to do. I joked, ""well, I've got 500 pages of something you can do right here,"" then gestured to her phone (It's not actually 500 pages long, I just said that to be hyperbolic) She smiled and stuck her tongue out and blew a raspberry at me. I knew she was joking, but I got frustrated. 

""Hey,"" I asked. ""So, is there a specific reason WHY you won't read my story?""
She shrugged. 

""I don't know. I just can't do books,"" she replied. 

I pointed at the 3-book set on our kitchen counter that had arrived from Amazon a day prior. 

""Really?""

She rolled her eyes and brushed off the comment, and we moved on with our night. We haven't spoken about it since, but I can tell she's getting sick of me mentioning it.

I honestly don't know. Is it too much to ask? AITA?",1
"Over the weekend my grandmother wanted to take me and two of my cousins to a play that was in town. I guess it was special to her because she was an actress when she was younger and she met my grandpa (who died when I was young) when she was playing the lead in this specific play. 

When we got there it just so happened that the girl I’ve had a crush on for years was there with her parents. We chatted before the show started and she pointed to where she was sitting. In the middle of the second act I saw her get up and go to the lobby. I have to be honest I was a little bored so i waited a minute and then I followed her. She was outside and said she was fighting with her boyfriend (he used to be a friend of mine). We talked for a little bit and then next thing I knew we were full on making out in her car. 

I had no idea how much time passed but I looked up and the play was over and everyone was coming out. My grandmother was so mad at me and I guess my cousins missed a lot of the second act because they were looking for me. I tried to play it off like I was helping a friend but she didn’t believe me.

My mom has grounded me (also my grades are really low because I’m a senior and already got accepted to ASU) and she said I will probably never get another chance to spend time with my grandmother like that again because she’s 77. AITA?",1
"I (56M) have a son (28M) who spent a lot of time traveling overseas in his college years. He went all around the world, including several trips to the Middle East, where he studied for his minor in Arabic language and literature.

A few years ago, my son found out that a woman he knew in Pakistan had a son (9M). She claimed this son was his, which I doubted. My son, however, believed her without question. He asked this woman to send her son to the US to stay with my son so they could get to know each other. He has spent the last few summers here.

Recently, the boy moved in with my son fulltime, a decision I strongly urged against. My son enrolled him in the same private school we sent him to at that age, which is very expensive. I have tried to support my son's decision, but it has been hard. I really want my son to get a DNA test, but he stubbornly keeps refusing.

Recently, things came to a head at a family dinner my son invited us to. He said the boy was feeling homesick, so they cooked Pakistani food together. My son wanted the whole family to eat this food, because he said it would make the boy feel like he and his culture were accepted by the whole family.

Now, I don't like Middle Eastern food. I don't like strong spices. My son begged me to just try some of it, or to at least eat the bread they made. The bread had flecks of all kinds of weird spices on it though, so I refused. My son got mad and asked me to please eat something just to ""make your grandson happy."" He pulled me aside for this, so the boy wasn't present to hear our conversation.

I told my son that I have no proof he is my grandson, and even if I did, I shouldn't have to eat food I don't like. My son called me a selfish, stubborn A and then asked me to leave. So, I did. My wife stayed though.

My wife agrees with me that I shouldn't have to eat food I don't like, but she said I could have at least tried a bite to appease our son. She thinks I was just being stubborn to be stubborn. I wasn't though. I don't like Middle Eastern food, that's all. How can I be the A for that? Still, my son isn't speaking to me right now. Should I have just tried some bread?",1
"I (69F) had my daughter (32F) and her bf (29M) over for dinner the other night.  Currently, my daughter lives very close by me, but she is getting ready to move in with her bf in about a month, and she will be about a hour away from me.  A couple weeks ago, I had asked my daughter a couple questions.  First, if her bf will be ok with her lack of cleanliness of her home when they live together (in my opinion, she doesn't clean enough), and if she will start dressing up more during the day once she lives with him (she works from home).

My daughter was already here when her bf got here.  When he gave her a hug, he said, ""what, no ball gown?"" and she just laughed.  I thought that was a weird comment, but I thought maybe it was an inside joke between the two of them or something.  Later on, he said something to her like, ""man, I'm so happy that you're cleaner than me!"" with a quick glance in my direction.  That's when it clicked that she must have told him what I said.  

After he left, I confronted my daughter about it, and she willingly admitted that she did tell him.  I asked why should would think it was ok to tell him our private conversations, and she said, ""I would never tell him something about you personally because that's no one's business but yours.  But when you made those comments, you not only obviously insulted me, but you insulted him by insinuating that he is a shallow enough person to care about that kind of stuff.  So yes, I told him what you said.""  Then she looked me dead in the eyes and said, ""Mom, he's my number one now.  He's my partner.""  And I just said, ""well obviously my feelings don't matter anymore.""  And I asked her to leave.  We haven't spoken since.  AITA?",1
"TL;DR: Roommate left chicken bones unattended, endangering my dog with health issues. Ongoing tensions escalated after disagreements over rent. AITA for demanding an apology and expecting him to be more careful? 

Long story: I've been rooming with a friend for nearly a year, just the two of us plus my dog and cat (I was left with both pets under my care after being cut off from my abusive parent). My dog, an 11-year-old, mostly stays in the living room due to his age and health issues. Initially I said dog would spend more time in the laundry room, but because of growing health concerns and roommate leaving his door open, this hasn’t been the case. I pay a higher portion (almost double) of rent than him. This was agreed based on me being able to afford the situation, considering the space my dog would occupy, and him telling me he could not afford any more money for rent, and claiming to make x amount of money. I later found out this amount was not correct and that we actually earn the same income. We don’t have a lease contract, so there is no legal requirement for any of us to pay x amount, just a verbal agreement with landlord about the total monthly rent. 

Recently, tensions rose when I asked to renegotiate the rent due to financial strain. He declined (which is fine) and asked for two and a half months to move out. This was a month ago. Last week I found someone who wants to move in a month from now, and asked roommate about it, but he backed out after initially agreeing, saying “I had agreed to give him two and a half months”. 

Today, I returned home to find my dog eating chicken bones left on my roommate's desk in the living room while he napped. When I confronted him, he brushed it off, refusing to apologize, saying it wasn't intentional. This is not the first time he has been careless around my dog*. He also complained that the dog is “pretty much living in the living room” instead of the laundry room/outside. I told him it’s unfair for him to complain about that because I pay more money precisely because of my dog, and that dogs are not meant to be locked up. I also brought up that he hasn’t been keeping cleaning agreements and he said he’d “do it when he can”. Cleaning agreements include not leaving food out that the dog can get to, among other things he has not been doing. I sometimes have to remind him of his chores for him to do them. 

I feel frustrated and angry about his lack of consideration, especially considering we are friends and he knows how much I care about my dog. He also knows I’ve been through something very traumatic recently and had “offered to support me in any way he can”. AITA for demanding an apology and expecting him to be more careful around my dog?

*One time, my dog vomited, seemed fine a couple hours later. I told my roommate to let me know if anything else happened because I was going out, and he said he would. Later, I found out my dog had vomited multiple times after my roommate gave him a treat, which he did not tell me of when it happened, but hours later. I rushed my dog to the vet and returned to find vomit everywhere with just some paper on it (and roommate cooking next to it). Another incident occurred when my dog needed a cone during an allergic episode. My roommate asked how the dog was, and I said he was improving. The next morning, I found my roommate had removed the cone, claiming I said the dog was better. I was furious and told him not to make medical decisions about my dog.

ETA: I’ve noticed I wasn’t clear about where the dog was “meant” to be. Roomie had agreed the dog could be in the rest of the house before moving. Laundry agreement was about the dog having a space that he could be in if needed/at night to sleep. For that to happen roommates door would need to be closed and it hasn’t been in the past few months due to local weather. 

Edit 2: for clarity, after some comments asked me to be more specific about a couple of things. ",1
"My wife got me a fake putting green for Christmas, it's one of those roll up things - cheap turf and plastic. I puttered around with it on Christmas, but haven't used it since. I don't think I've seen anyone use it - though our youngest does drag it out (but he is 2 and just drags everything out if he can). While cleaning up today, I folded it up and put it in the trash outside - she saw it tonight as she took out the trash. She is furious and has been calling me a selfish asshole and claims I knew she'd be upset and so hid it from her. She keeps repeating ""don't lie to me""- I see it as a cheap trinket from Christmas - one I'd rather have not wasted the money on. It's not like I was sneaky - I just threw it out, and honestly, I did think there'd be a chance she would be upset about me throwing it out. AITA?

Edit: to answer some questions
1) it was pretty cheap and had permanent bumps in it from being folded up in the packaging

2) I'm not a golfer

Edit2: I'm seeing a few themes for those voting YTA

1) it was less than a month
2) not telling her before tossing it",1
"So context: I am a learner driver who has just started getting comfortable with the road. I don't know how it is anywhere else but here in Australia, if we're learners we need to have L plates on our vehicles, so it was very obvious I was a new driver.

Well today I had to stop at a roundabout. My dad who was supervising me told me to start going, but a car came around the roundabout on my right so I had to give way and wait for a while. Eventually, the oncoming cars stopped where they were supposed to, which looking back should have been weird to me, as they had right of way from me.

Because they stopped, I checked around and started driving slow, confused why I was able to go. But then when my car was halfway over the dotted line, a green motorbike came around the roundabout (this must be who the cars were stopping for). I realised my mistake and slowed down so he could get past me, and then I planned to continue around after he had gone but instead he decided to just stop in front of me. Because of this, I had barely any time to stop and ended up stopping just as I bumped his tire and knocked his bike over by accident. He, like, kinda fell off as well. 

At this point I was sitting there, mortified. After all, this was my first accident I'd ever had, even as a passenger I'd never been in an accident. Luckily, since I just bumped his tire, there was no damage to either of our vehicles. But he did come over to my window and yell at me about how I ""cut him off"" (how could I cut him off if he was in front of me?), and he also made me lift his bike up again (I did because I felt so bad for making this happen). And then he yelled at me by his bike where my dad couldn't defend me. The whole time I apologised profusely and felt absolutely awful.

After that, he got on his bike and drove away, so I drove off too. I drove for about 20 minutes to get home after that and the whole time my dad was talking to me about it and reassuring me that it wasn't my fault and that the guy was a bully who just wanted to scare a learner, but I still felt and feel now very bad about what happened and feel like I could have looked harder when that car gave way to me when it had right of way.

AITA?",1
"I (29F) have 2 siblings, Kara (26F) and Lois (23F). I also have a daughter (8F) who we will call V. Me and my sisters have all been pretty close. We had done everything together when we were younger. As for my daughter, she hates being alone, ever since her father passed, she clung to my side for a long time before she started to become more independent.

Yesterday, I took V to see her grandparents for lunch. My sisters live with our parents since they both don't have a stable job. When I arrived at my parent's house, Lois greeted us at the door. I asked her where our parents were, and she said that they had gone to the grocery store. She said that she could take care of V until they came back. I agreed since Lois and Kara had both babysat V many times for some easy cash. I left and called my parents to let them know what I had done. I left to go do some errands. When I finished with everything, and as I was heading back to my parent's house, Kara called me. She said that V is being ""a brat"" and I need to come get her now. I rushed over there and saw my parents yelling at my sisters and my daughter on the porch crying. I went over to them and asked them what happened. My mom started explaining that my sisters left the house while I was gone and left V alone in the house. Thankfully, she was only in there for about 45 minutes before my parents came home. I was livid. I picked up my daughter and yelled at my sisters that they were not allowed to see me or my kid again. Kara had started saying that it was unfair and that V was old enough to be by herself. Lois was trying to say something but I wasn't listening. I left to my car while they were arguing and went home.

When I got home, I talked with my daughter about what had happened and asked her if they had done this before. She said that they hadn't done this before except for this one time, but they were only gone for 2 minutes. I hugged my daughter and told her that we would never see her aunts again. My daughter started sobbing, screaming that it was only a mistake and that she loved her aunties. I didn't know how to explain anymore so I told her to have a little nap. When I checked my phone, I got 12 missed calls from my sisters, with many texts. I didn't read any nor call them back. After V sobbing, I feel guilty, but I think I'm doing the right thing. My parents believe that what they did was horrible, but we are family so we shouldn't cut contact.

So, AITA?

Edit - I made a new post about an update on my profile.",1
" AITA for including my FIL on a group text? Husband (M/54) & I (F/45) live 10 mins from IL's (87/88). Hubs won't move away IL's, in the event they needed him. It was his decision, & I accepted it as terms of our marriage. SIL (F/52) left for college at 18 & never moved back, living under 3grs away. She doesn’t work & has been a stay-at-home Mom for 18 yrs. Hubs worked in a factory f while I started my business & did not have leniency to help IL’s. The first 5 yrs I was in business I was the one taking care of them when needed. They were more mobile and my FIL still drove then, but it was me who sacrificed days I should have been at my office to tend to them. Income was tight but we always made it work. Last yr, Hubs was driving through her town & asked SIL to breakfast. He asked her to help with MIL’s eye appointments which are every scheduled every 8 weeks, plenty of tome to plan around. We handle all of the day-to-day, from grocery shopping to taxi for all other necessities. In addition, when there’s an emergency, which with the elderly happens often, we handle that as well. \[Examples: FIL mobility is declining so Hubs goes over to help him shower once a week. When he can't stand he has to drive over to help him stand up; including from the toilet. MIL bladder fell out & called me at 9pm & I took her to OBGYN following morning at 8am.\]

Fast forward 6 months & Hubs called SIL to ask when she'll be able to help. After reminding her that he asked for help months ago, SIL became agitated. SIL: I don’t live there. Hubs: It’s a day trip, we make 1 day trips to visit you all the time (2 weeks prior for nephews Grad party, drove down & back in the same day w/ IL's). SIL: Well, I’m busy (as she was packing for last min trip to Hawaii with her family). Hubs: We are too. SIL: I have the kids. Hubs: So do I, & mine are younger. SIL: Yeah, well mine are ""active"" (said condescendingly). Hubs: I've been taking care on Mon & Dad 3 years, I need help. SIL: (very aggressively) It has NOT been 3 years, it’s been 1. Hubs: I’ve been getting their groceries since Covid & that was 3 years ago! Me: (in the background not yelling but apparently loud enough that I was overheard) I did it for years before you could because of your job. SIL: I don’t need to hear HER mouth in the background. Hubs: (sigh) we work... SIL: Well, from everything Mom & Dad told me, you owe them.

Hubs drove to IL's to confront IL's who were mortified & said they never insinuated we owed them anything, and that we didn't. The next morning, I sent a group text to SIL, BIL, Hubs. But at the last second, I also included my FIL. My thought, she was the one who brought them into the conversation as her source, may as well make sure we’re all on the same page. I told her she was gross & out of line. An hour later BIL text me saying I had every right to feel the way I did but did not have to include FIL on text I that I ruined the family with my big mouth by doing so. AITA to including IL's on text?",1
"I (22transM) live with my grandmother (73F) and have for about 4 or 5 years now. It was a pretty intense way I ended up living with her. My entire life I had been heavily abused by my mother. When I was 18 I moved in with my grandmother permanently bc my mother tried to make it a rule that I couldn't have panic attacks in her house. I have CPTSD and an anxiety disorder.  
To keep it short: My grandma said that she would help me with my panic attacks and that it was wrong of my mother to try and make such a rule. That whatever I needed, she would help me get through this.  
But for some reason, she has refused, in like 4 years to do much better. When I develop a panic attack, it usually has a trigger, and bad conflicts and lack of communication/sarcasm can be a bad trigger for me. She often flips out on me and her first reaction is to yell at me. From there it only gets worse. She gets in my face, I cry and beg her to ""be nice to me"". Idk why, but my panic attacks can make me repeat sort of ""begging commands"" to who's there. She gets in my face and screams at me to ""stop it"", threatens to call police or emts, sarcastically says mean comments, when I erratically tell her that she's being mean, she'll go ""How? How am I? Tell me how I'm mean!"" It takes almost 2 hours for her to actually start trying to help me, and by then the yelling, and fighting, and berating, and questioning has already given me multiple attacks.  
To me, this is ridiculous. I was promised a safe place, where my needs would be met. I pay rent, and I don't think understanding that I have some triggers that need accommodations and not screaming at me while I'm having an emergency is unreasonable. It's been 4 years, and she can't manage to not scream the first time, as well as other poor handling. It's gotten to a point where I'm getting frustrated, and have expressed that if she cares about me, she is going to have to make up for it.  
I'll admit my needs for my triggers can be demanding. I personally just can't take not being spoken to super softly during attacks, and I just can't answer complex questions like ""what did you do at work today."" I know it's hard, but ig in my mind if you know someone is having a panic attack, you should love them enough to not scream at them?  
These last few times, I have begged her to do some research on panic attacks, how to help, and what not to do. She only did it once, and when I pointed out she didn't do much else, she blew up at me, and gave me an attack. She was worse than ever and did it for like 4 hours. She said she's ""sorry"" again and I couldn't take it. I told her to apologize for every single act she could remember taking this time one by one for me to forgive her, because her apologies are often empty ""well i'm sorry"". It's been years, and I FEEL justified, but is this unreasonable to ask? AITA?",1
"The story is simple but context is important .

This story takes place in a small town in Spain. Most towns (meaning 99% of them) have specific regulations for driveways, where the owner must pay an annual fee AND hang an official sign (called VADO) next to the door , so people know they are not allowed to park there. 

Disclaimer specifically for US redditors: urban sprawl is not a common thing in Spain, so most towns / cities are compact and somewhat vertical. Even towns with a lot of independent housing are compact, and those houses are close of each other, on narrow streets with sidewalks and generally walled. Driveways are usually a narrow gate (3-4 meters wide), and vehicles enter through those ""VADOS"" marked with yellow paint on the pavement and the official sign on the wall.

 So, the story is at it follows: 

My wife and I pick our son from school every day on this part of town that has not a lot of parking. Sometimes the area is packed and there is this house with this driveway BUT without the vado sign. So it is legally permitted to park, as the owner of the house has not paid the permit to forbid others from parking in front of it.

We don't park there UNLESS there is no free space anywhere.

So we have had some arguments with the owner and their relatives about us being ""bad people"" , ""not thougtful"" and also got some insults and threats. 

Our polite response has always been : if you don't want anyone park here, just pay the license. Also to note that parking there doesn't take long... just 5 minutes, so if they REALLY need to get in / out of their home, they only would need to wait for 5 minutes. 

AITA? ",1
"I (27F) have a college friend (26F) who usually stays in touch with me through social media and frequent phone calls. We mostly share almost every single life update with our little girl group that stayed together even after college.

Recently, she's been hanging out with a couple of male co-workers who she considers close friends. One of the guys though, clearly likes her to a point that he wants to marry her and is not stopping even after she has openly rejected him twice. Another guy (in the same group who already has a long distance girlfriend) have multiple times invited her at his place during WFH days so they could ""work together in peace"". 

Today, she called me out for being overprotective and unbearable when I explained my disgust over an inappropriate and sexual joke they made against women in her colleagues group (for context - she's the only female in the group). Is it bad that I am concerned about her safety with such men?",1
"I was at my old high school track getting cardio in, and as I was running a little girl was standing on the side and waved at me so I waved back. The next lap, she stuck her hand out to me give me a high five but I just ran pass her. I wanted to be a good guy and give her a high five, but then I thought what if the people on the football see me and think I’m doing something inappropriate? It does seem odd to men and women if a random guy without kids is playing/talking with kids they don’t know. I really thought about it and thought maybe also I just showed this kid that people can be rude or cold for no reason which is something I don’t wanna teach kids honestly.",1
"I'm on my phone, I'm typing really fast and English isn't my first language, so please excuse my grammar. 

My ex husband and I don't have an amicable relationship. He left me for another woman and since the divorce I haven't spoken to him in a friendly way. Our interactions are business like and I don't like to chit chat with him, even though he tries to be friendly.

So according to our custody arrangement, my ex gets our daughter every other weekend and is there for all the pick ups and drop offs 
. He chose it to be that way as he was the one to push for the divorce to be with his pregnant lover. He did make the divorce easy for me. 

However, I don't think of him as my friend and I'm counting down years until I get to be free of tolerating his presence.

This is where the conflict comes up -

He lives 3 hours away, he drives our daughter home on Sunday evenings. This particular Sunday there was heavy landslide on the highway blocking the roads. The usual 3 hours drive turned into 8 hours. I was worried sick, but he finally got her home at around 11 pm. 

Since they were stranded on road, they didn't have anything to eat. My daughter wasn't as hungry since she ate right before the drive. Ex apparently ate nothing the entire day. As he dropped her off, he looked sick and exhausted, and made awkward, uneasy comments about dying from thirst and hunger and having to look for a hotel to stay the night. The nearest hotel from my home is a 3 hour drive away, and he knows that. 

I ignored his comments and didn't offer him food or water. I basically gave him a half smile and politely shut the door on his face. 

The next morning I got to know that he got into a car accident as a result of sheer exhaustion. He wasn't hurt, but had to be admitted in the hospital. Apparently he fainted out of pure exhaustion. He fainted before he got to the hotel. 

He had to stay in the hospital for 2 days. My family thinks that I've turned into a cruel human being and that they are horrified about my apparent lack of empathy. I usually am a very caring person by nature, and was really caring and nurturing towards him our entire marriage. I had other faults, but being uncaring was not one of them. 

AITA for not offering him food and water and maintaining my boundaries?",1
"My 5th grade since is part of an after school program. Basically he stays on the yard and plays with his friends and does activities. It's like an after school camp.

I work by his school and took a late 3pm lunch today. I went to the grocery store and was befuddled by all these kids running rampant. I realized they were from my son's school. Then I saw this short blonde hair kid who looked like my son chasing this kid who looked like his best friend with a bag of sugar and weaving between people.

As he got closer I realized this was my son. As he ran passed me, I pulled him into me and told him to calm down. He realized it was me and asked why I was there. I said I was on lunch and why is he there. He said his teachers took the after school camp to the store to buy snacks. 

He asked me to let him go and I said no. I told him he knows how to act in a store and as his dad, his behavior embarrassed me. I took him to one of the teachers and asked if he belong to him. He said yes, to him and another teacher. He asked what was wrong and if I could let him go.

I said he and other kids are running around the store like a playground and you and Mrs. Daniel should be watching them better. Oh and I'm his dad. Mrs. Daniel came over and asked what was wrong. I told her what I told the other teacher.

She said I knew you looked familiar and laughed. I said this isn't funny. You better handle my son's behavior or I will and no one will like it. The guy teacher said ""please don't talk down to us like that."" I said then please do your job.",1
"Obligatory throwaway notice

I know the title seems absurd, but hear me out.

I (27f) am the head of a childcare-related business. We’re relatively small (only about six employees) but the ones I’ll be mentioning are K (17f) and B (86f). 

B, though in excellent shape, is elderly and isn’t able to move around as well as she once did. She often plays with the kids and allows them to be physical with her. We employ her as an as-needed worker, meaning she generally comes later in the day when K is working. 

A few weeks ago, B was playing with the children and allowed them to get rough with her (pull on her clothes, push her around, etc). K tried to intervene, but B assured her it was all fine and that she could take care of herself.

Well, later that day, one of the children hugged her so hard that she tripped and fell into the wooden playhouse. She ended up being virtually incapacitated on the ground. Meaning K, the seventeen year old, had to call 911 and help B as best she could, all while having to wrangle over a dozen young children. B ended up being totally fine, and was released from the hospital the next day. 

However, that event was extremely hard on K. She’s an extremely capable worker, but seeing someone she cared about hurt combined with having to call 911 and being virtually alone with the kids was hard. She asked me privately if I would be okay with instructing B and the kids to not get too physical with B. K has said she’s terrified of having another event like that, and I don’t blame her. 

I talked with the kids and parents to make sure they understand that playing with K is different than playing with B, and they need to be more gentle. However, when I discussed this with B, she accused me of being ageist and said she could do everything she used to do just fine. Our coworkers are divided. AITA?",1
"I (49m) have 3 kids (14m (John), 17f (Marie), 19f (Bella)). Last year John and Marie's school had a musical. John was part of the crew ad worked o lights and sound with some other people, meaning he was not needed for that to work. Marie had the lead female role in the musical (I specify because there is also a lead male role). I believed that due to this my daughter played a bigger and far more important part. The musical sold out on the first 2 nights and overall did really well. I was proud of Marie and bought her a bluetooth speaker that she had been wanting and we went to one of her favorite restaurants, yet I merely congratulated John and he looked quite bummed at the dinner and when she got the gift.

My wife felt my son also deserved a gift but I said that he didn't do much and his part wasn't as important therefore didn't deserve that much. She said that the show wouldn't have happened without the crew ad I said she was being ridiculous and treating both accomplishments as the same would be giving him a participation trophy and would be unfair to Marie. 

Bella said this logic was stupid and both of them were mad at me at the time and I felt like an asshole at the time, and the topic came up as both of them are participating in the fall play this year as well yet this year Marie was cast as a side character, and John is again on crew. AITA?",1
"I (21f) and my friend Jim(22m) have been online friends for about 5 years. I thought we had a good communication flow. We would chat about everything. Over the past 2 years, I've noticed that he will trust me like a rollercoaster. One day he will be open about his stressors and the next week he will shut anything about him down and redirect his conversation to something else. This happens every time he interacts with one of his friends. its become a pattern?
Last November we were gathering people for our annual Secret Santa contest. We do not do a lot of activities together as time zones make it complicated. I thought this was one of the things we did every year because we don't do a lot. (financials understanding) This year Jim claimed he was saving and passed on Secret Santa. I was annoyed but understood nonetheless. We planned on a movie night in December as we were both on break.
I work in retail, holidays sucked this year. Normally I am very ""OMG ITS XMAS"". As we were both busy with semesters ending we didn't chat much but when we did we would ask each other about how things were going. every time we chatted from nov- late December he would ask how I was doing and I replied that work was awful but nothing much was going on, waiting for the holidays to be over. My response was the same, nothing happened and the holidays sucked. at some point, Jim kept pushing it. ""why aren't you xmasy this year?"" ""You're normally so excited for xmas"" ""Why aren't you excited for xmas"" ""Did you lose motivation for school?"" every. time. we. talked.  I started getting offended. I've stated multiple times why I want the holidays to be over, and why I was feeling awful/stressed. I finally snapped and asked Jim to stop.
""Every time we talk you ask me why I'm not excited for the holidays. Nothing changed I'm just going to work doing school work and chilling at home. You keep pushing this subject, I do not want to talk more about this matter. I've respected when you want to drop a subject. You then start going on about how I'm losing motivation for school work? why would I? it's my first year, you make me out to be so undetermined. Not to mention you forgot our plans? ""I went out with so and so it was a fun time"" So... I'm not important enough to remember our plans? okay, I guess, I won't schedule plans with you. start to distance myself a bit. stop messaging first as much.""
jims response to this was... not great? he acted surprised. Saying he was human and he forgets things. he didn't mean to forget our plans. He hoped I wasn't one to hold grudges.
so it's been about 2 months. I thought that maybe he would.. idk reach out first? nope. And here I read in the gc as to why he skipped Secret Santa this year... 3 foreign trips and a brand-new iPhone pro. my first thought was ""and he couldn't spare 20 for the only event we hold..... but he can go out to eat and travel"" I see how it is.
So my question is. AITA for calling him out on his bullshit?",1
"I (28M) have been dating “B” (24F) for almost a year now. Her college friend “K” is getting married this summer and I’ll be her plus one to the wedding. K just asked B to be the maid of honor. The issue is that B’s ex boyfriend is going to be the best man and she gave me a heads up that they’ll be walking down the aisle together and will have to meet up at some point before the wedding to prepare a joint reception toast and plan the bachelor + bachelorette trip (requests from the bride and groom).

Obviously I don’t want to tell her who she can and can’t hang out with, but I just don’t feel comfortable with B spending so much time with her ex, especially because they only broke up a few months before we started dating and have a lot of history together. I asked her to see if she could make some changes to those plans because I would have the respect to do it for her if roles were reversed. It became a huge fight because she thinks I don’t trust her even though that’s not true.

She also said that she doesn’t want to change any of those plans because K specifically asked her and her ex to be in charge of all of the bridal party together. I even suggested what if she just texted/Zoomed with her ex, I don’t see why they have to be in person and hanging out for the planning. To this she just said she can hang out with her ex, it’s “not that deep”. I don’t know if I even want to attend the wedding anymore as her plus one because it just feels like she’s picking her ex over our relationship. Since then, K has texted me saying I can’t tell B what to do (which I didn’t, I simply made a request) and that I’m ruining the wedding planning. AITA?",1
"New account, but I’ve been reading here for a while. My (64f) son (31) was over and I was asking him about his girlfriend of about 3 years. Now, I’ve only met her a handful of times, but I know they’re serious because they plan trips and talk about buying a home. I asked why she never comes over bc it seems like she doesn’t like me. I’ve asked him this before and he never gave an answer, but today he seemed fed up and pretty much told me it was because of me. He told me that I act “too weird and intense.” When I wanted examples, he told me 1) I kept on interrupting conversations she was having with my husband - but it was because I think she was bored. 2) I try to get too close to her during dinner - I would have thought she’d want to sit next to me and get to know me since she can sit next to my son any other time. 3) I wasn’t very hospitable by asking her to help with clean up and not offering her coffee when I offered everyone else. I will admit that is true because I didn’t think she’d want any. 

And he also brought up something I did with his ex years ago, which I’ve already apologized for. 

I told him I think this is ridiculous. She’s a very smart and capable woman. I told him I don’t understand why she needs to be catered to like this. She can get her own coffee! He told me it’s not worth trying to explain things and ended up leaving. 

WITAH the asshole for doing that to his girlfriend, and for thinking she’s quite immature for not wanting to come over to my house bc she wasn’t catered to enough? She may think I’m too weird but I don’t think that justifies not coming over when she’s in a serious relationship with my son.",1
"
Basically the situation is that I asked one of the admin staff at my university when they would upload the slides of a lecture. They told us last week they asked the professor for it so this week I thought I would ask for an update as I missed the lecture.

The response I got back from the member of staff was that as per their last email they asked for it. My question wasn't answered, it's as if she got annoyed at me asking her. I get it, lots if people are complaining but that is no excuse to start lashing out. I was then asked why I missed that lecture and why there is no absence request recorded. Attendance is recorded for everything BUT lectures. Lectures are not mandatory to attend and we do not have to send absence requests for lectures. 

In hindsight, my reply was too nice as I just ended up firmly explaining that to her without raising my main issue - why did she have to go out of her way to check if I submitted an absence request for something I don't have to let them know about, and does she usually dig into student's private information when asked about lecture slides? Because this would be a violation of GDPR (data protection) to access student's data for reasons other than the purpose of why they are collected and held on file. 

So I am thinking to report this as a violation of GDPR (if I did this they would certainly have to draft a new stricter policy, making everyone's life more difficult), or to raise this directly with her why she is checking student records for this (although following the conversation we had this certainly would not go well and would make her hate me even more). When I was discussing this with someone I overheard someone else mentioning that they are stressed due to the amount of complaints they are getting and that I'd be TA for over reacting but I don't think their frustration is an excuse for shitty behaviour and data protection violations. The way I see it while I might be blowing it out of proportion, if no one says anything she will just do it others in the future. 

So WIBTA?",1
"Hey, so i am in this situation and i dont know what to do and my brother reccomended i post here and i made an account, so here we go.

I am a junior in highschool and my boyfriend(Craig), his friends and his ex (Ronnie) are all seniors. Craig and Ronnie dated for about 8 months a year ago. He told me that they decided that they were better off friends and then 4 months ago we started dating. Im going to be honest, i really dont like Ronnie but she claims that she likes me and ""that Craig and i work really well together."" Shes loud and annoying and i personally dont like how close her and Craig are, given their history. I have told Craig that their relationship makes me uncomfortable and he said that he wouldnt stop being friends with her and encouraged me to maybe try to see past their history as they are no longer together and he doesnt see Ronnie like that anymore.

So a couple days ago, Ronnie told our friend group this ""hilarious"" story about how she hung out with a couple stoners on Monday and they smoked weed at the park behind the school. Everyone thought it was really funny but i didnt. I think that its really irresponsible and illeagal. They shouldnt have done it and lots of other kids who have done that got in serious trouble, why shouldnt she? So a couple days ago I reported Ronnie and she was called to the front office and one of Craig's friends told me that apparently she got in a lot of trouble. I was told she was suspended for a week and a letter was sent to the University she was going to go to. 

Craig and his friends were really angry for Ronnie and said that she didnt deserve to now have her future comprimised. My friend who knew i reported her said that i should tell Craig because what i did was really shitty and i said that it didnt really matter that. Yesterday afternoon my friend told Craig and he was really mad at me and said that he never wanted to talk to me again and this was a petty bitchy thing to do. Hes now not speaking to me and i dont know what to do.

(sorry, i want to be clear, they didnt just suspend her on my word. they searched her locker and her bag and found weed in her bag)",1
"I picked up my daughter’s boyfriend (Ron, not his name) from his house Friday night so we could watch a Christmas movie together. My daughter (Molly, not her name) and I had already had dinner at a restaurant after Christmas shopping but he hadn’t. So I offered to make him dinner. Ron wanted to prepare something on his own, so I told him he could use our kitchen. He’s done this before, is responsible and uses our equipment with care. BTW they are both 17.      


We get home and he walks into the kitchen… which was a mess and that’s my fault. I hadn’t had time to clean it up after cooking dinner the night before.      


Ron says he can’t work like this and proceeds to clean up the kitchen with my daughter’s help. I left the kitchen to do something else. A few minutes later I walk into the kitchen to make tea and hear my daughter say the mess is due to my procrastination. So I explain that I had been up since 3am (I work the early shift) and hadn’t had time to clean the kitchen because I had other things to take care of *and* I had taken her Christmas shopping after work. She asked if I was done. I went to the living room to watch TV.      


Minutes later Ron goes outside with the small compost bucket for kitchen scraps to dump in the large bin provided by the city. He walks back in complaining about the gunk stuck in the bottom which did not fall out. It’s a mixture of coffee grounds and bacon fat so it’s hard to shake out. He tells me he’s going to hose it off outside. As he’s leaving I remember that the outdoor hose is off because it’s winter, so I yell, “Come back! The hose won’t work it’s turned off!” My daughter tells me not to yell and I tell her to tell him the hose won’t work, it’s winter.      


Note: This is the second time in a week that he’s expressed disgust at our kitchen scraps bucket so I’m getting irked about it because I take it as a criticism whether he means it that way or not. Also the fact of his parents’ kitchen always being clean is a something that he and my daughter have made a point of mentioning a few times.        


Ron returns with the bucket and Molly washes it out in the sink. When she’s done washing it he comes to the living room holding the bucket explaining that he’s going to put parchment (baking paper) in the bottom to prevent the gunk from sticking to the bottom again. I interrupt him and ask him to please not tell me about it because I’m not interested. He continues and I ask him again not to tell me, I don’t want to know. He has a puzzled expression on his face and starts again. I tell him to stop talking about it and if he cannot stop to go home because I don’t want to hear about it. He stops and leaves the living room to join Molly in her room.      


About 15 minutes later Ron says goodnight and leaves.      

Molly has asked me to apologies to Ron and I’m having a hard time convincing myself I was in the wrong.",1
"To start, free bleeding is essentially not wearing any form of protection on your period (so you are bleeding freely - clues in the name).

I'm currently staying at my MILs house with my husband for a family get together (six birthdays in one week).

I have horrifically painful periods and bad mobility. I can not use cups and am allergic to all brands of pad I've used (rashes on all genitalia, which does not feel good). I do have cloth pads but I only brought a couple small ones for my trip as I wasn't due on until days after we got home, but we're on day four of our trip and I started my period on our first night. 

I tried to use some disposable pads I picked up but I broke out in a rash and have blisters everywhere they should not be, so two days ago I decided to say what the hell and free bleed like I do at home.

I bring my own towels to my MILs, so I have been sitting and sleeping on those. I have bled through twice but cleaned the mess and left no stain. 

My MIL is pissed off to say the least. She's disgusted by my lack of decorum and carrying my bloody towel around everywhere. She also hates that I'm washing them in her machines and is now saying we need to pay to have them professionally cleaned (which we will do).

Everything kinda came to a head last night when she lost it on me for ""behaving like an animal"". She wants me to leave, but my husband stay, which isn't possible (one car, I can't drive that far, especially not with the amount of pain I'm in).

My husband is on damage control but I just feel so shitty. Am I in the wrong here? I understand that it's not super sanitary but my health matters more than some bed sheets. I'll replace them if she wants.

I'm close to just gritting my teeth through the pain and putting a pad on, but I really don't want to. I don't want open sores down there when we're driving home - sitting for that long will suck.

AITA? I feel like I'm choosing the lessar of two evils but now I don't know.",1
