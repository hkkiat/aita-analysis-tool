Basically passive stuff that I tried to ignore til it extended to friends and family. FYI this went on for months and months and months!!.\nWe went to christmas celebration at his family's home. My SIL complimented my floral maxi dress and my husband said \"I agree it looks nice on you...though I have to admit that your waist could get smaller than this!\". Awkward silence took over. I was absolutely fuming and this was my last straw. So I got up from my chair in the middle of dinner and shouted at the top of my lungs \"SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY BODDDYYY!!!!\". He was absolutely speechless as his family stared while some others tried to get me to calm down but situation got more tense and dinner ended up being cut short and my husband storming off to his friend's place to spend the night upon leaving a very nasty text saying I embarrassed him and made a scene over an \"observation\" he made. He called me childish and told me to get therapy for my insecurities instead of verbally abusing him and scaring his family.\nNow I feel like an absolute idiot asshole and like I ruined christmas for him and everybody with my over sensitivity.
