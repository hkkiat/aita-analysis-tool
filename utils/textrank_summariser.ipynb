I (15f) felt left out. My life had been really difficult up to then and I was struggling with everything. I had lost my mom two years before, and I also suffered a brain injury and was grieving the loss of a lot of memories of my mom, I was recovering and dad was distracted with Jane. It was tough. But then my dad got along with Amy so much better and he always seemed more into the time he spent with her than the time he spent with me. He also shared more of his own interests with her. He took her to special places he adored that he didn't ever take me to. And I wanted to go. He shared with her stuff he didn't share with me. I was jealous and I was hurt. I tried to explain to my dad but he told me it was selfish to want to keep him to myself and to leave Amy without a dad and how her dad didn't want to know her so he needed to fill that role for her. Amy would tell me to just accept that dad liked her better and he was her dad more than mine now. My dad knew about it and didn't care.\\n\\nHe did spend time with me. But it was stuff I liked and he'd act like it was the biggest burden to spend time with me. He fell asleep a few times and he would zone out a lot and leave me to do the stuff alone even though he was physically there.\\n\\nMy grandpa, my dad's dad, noticed and he started spending more time with me and creating a bond with me that we didn't have before. My dad isn't that close to his dad. But grandpa has been the best. He even loved my mom and he told me how sad it made him when my parents divorced. He's told me stories about her and about her and me that I don't remember any longer. It has been amazing and apparently it has healed a lot of the pain of my dad's lack of interest because my dad noticed and he got SO jealous.\\n\\nHe confronted me a few days ago saying I was ignoring him and spending way too much time with grandpa. He asked me why I stopped asking about our time together. I told very clear he prefers spending time with Amy and can't stand time with me, so I'm spending time with someone who enjoys me. He told me I don't have the right to rub my favoritism of grandpa in his face. I called him a hypocrite and told him he treated Amy better than me for years, he showed favoritism to her, opened up to her and shared with her in a way he never did with me and it wasn't okay. I told him he then called me selfish for telling him how it made me feel. I told him she knows him better than I do and it's not my fault. I said he allowed that to happen and allowed her to feel so smug about it. He walked away from the conversation.\\n\\nDad decided the two of us need family therapy yesterday. He came out with it from nowhere. He said it's the only way to fix it. I told him family therapy won't fix us when he can't even stay and have a conversation with me. He told me I used to be willing to try and now I'm not and it's not okay.\\n\\nAITA?\",\n          \"obligatory sorry for the length\\n\\nthe back-story is that now that my (42M) and my brother's (46M) families are done with kids, my parents (\\\\~75) wanted to do a nice big family photo all together. they were planning to go on an overseas trip halfway for 3 mos so my wife A (41F) planned and paid for the photo for before they left.\\n\\nthe photog, P, had a small studio in his apt (we live in NYC) but it might be too small for all 10 of us, so my SIL, B (42F),  offered up their place. we often do big family events there. P suggested buying a backdrop ($80) and linked to one at a local store. i buy it, but balk at the shipping px of $100. it's not heavy but unwieldy, think of a ten foot long rolled up paper roll. so i carry it across manhattan to B's apartment two days before the shoot.\\n\\nday of the shoot, B suggested taking the photo outside or their community room. P suggests we try those and if it doesn't look great we could always use the backdrop in the apartment. we take some photos, like what we see, so we stop there. P suggests we just return the backdrop and get our money back.\\n\\ni ask B if its ok to leave the backdrop there, but because work was busy i could probably pick it up the following week. the following sunday, i text B asking if thurs would be ok to pick it up as i had some time in my schedule and she says OK. that evening, after speaking to A, i realize that we were going over again that saturday for my brother's bday and i text B again asking if we could just pick it up then since we're there anyway and we'd have a car. she says she's annoyed but its fine. i respond that if she needed it out sooner, i could stick to the original plan of thurs but receive no response.\\n\\nthat wed night, my brother calls me and basically says the thing needs to be out of their apt now. my brother's a pretty reasonable guy and wouldn't make such a sudden demand on me, and i realize he and B were fighting about it and he called me so it could be resolved. i agree to head over, but before i leave, A is upset at this sudden demand. she wonders why they can't store it for two more days than planned when she did all the planning and paying. she texts B asking to talk on the phone (i advised against this) but B refused to talk on the phone.\\n\\nso i head over and bring it back on the subway, which was not easy. my brother was waiting outside when i got there and he thanked me for coming, knows it was somewhat unreasonable, but it was good to get done. he says B was:\\n\\n1. annoyed at the clutter when she goes through cleaning fits\\n2. annoyed that A had time to take our son to a bday party the previous sat but make time to pick up the backdrop\\n3. triggered by her son tripping over the backdrop (no injury)\\n\\nthat sat, we go over anyway so the kids could play, and the backdrop was brought up. B says we were inconsiderate, but i countered that i was communicating but that she wasn't and a sudden demand was unreasonable.\\n\\nhad to leave some info out for length but happy to answer q's\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He started making little digs saying 'good evening' and asking me 'what I've done all day'. I told him absolutely nothing, to which he said it was 'ridiculous' that I felt it was acceptable to 'laze about in bed all day' to which I responded that it is none of his damn business if I want to lie in bed all weekend and abruptly ended the call. \\n\\nI feel I'm in the right but my aunt and best friend seems to think I'm the AH \\n\\nAm I the asshole Reddit?\",\n          \"I'm getting married in a week. One of my  bridesmaids, June, is pretty much the opposite of me. Shes very reserved whereas I am a party type gal--love going out to clubs with my fiance! Anyways, for my Bachelorette party, I wanted to go hire male strippers. Everyone thought it was a great idea...except June.\\n\\nJune said she was happy I was happy, but she wouldn't be attending that type of event. I asked her why, I made sure to plan it on a day everyone could come. She said it wasn't something she was comfortable with. I got upset and told her its not about her comfort, its about attending to support me.\\n\\nShe told me she would be very upset if her husband attended a party with strippers and so she woule never even ask to do the same. It would be \\\"hypocritical\\\" of her to hold him to those standards but expect to be able to do what she wanted just bc it was my Bachelorette. June told me she'd be happy to attend once they left but there was no way she'd disrespect her husband like that. She also said that even if he wasn't in the picture, shes not comfortable with it.\\n\\nI got very upset and told her she was a bad friend for completely refusing to even ask her husband or to put aside her goody-two-shoes attitude for one night thats for ME, NOT her or her husband.\\n\\nAita for getting mad?\\n\\n**Edit: Alright guys, I get it, Im a major asshole. I really didn't expect it to blow up this much. June ended up seeing it, I didn't know she had reddit. It hasn't gone well. Her husband called me and said some really rude things because June has been crying ever since she saw it. I guess I'm going to have to go deal with this now.

I have no idea what happened but I still managed to get pregnant. I immediately decided to get an abortion.\\nI asked my bf if he could come and support me through the procedure. He said he didn\\u2019t want to take a day off. Full disclosure if it gives insight: he works from home taking contracts as a programmer, makes $150k a year and can take off whenever he feels like it.\\n\\nSo whatever, he told me he wasn\\u2019t coming and that I had to take care of it. This was a week ago. The procedure was yesterday and it went as well as can be expected. I went to his house afterwards and he told me he had a surprise for me: it was a small, child sized bowl with cutesy animals on it. I thanked him but mentioned that this was maybe not the best gift as I just had a tough day and was emotional at best. \\nHe then told me he had a wonderful day with his family and proceeded to show me a video of his father and nephew doing egg hunts together and the father teaching the nephew to wash his hands, etc.\\nSo I immediately started bawling because I just terminated a pregnancy ( it wasn\\u2019t wanted and I don\\u2019t regret it, but it doesn\\u2019t mean I feel sensitive about it). He became very cold and asked me to stop crying, saying that I was overreacting and he was just trying to make me feel better. He didn\\u2019t apologize and we went to bed upset. I woke up in the middle of the night because I was cramping and sore, so I went on his couch and had a good cry. Apparently that woke him up because he came to ask me if I was going to continue crying for long and told me to turn off the lights ASAP because I was being inconsiderate.\\n\\nAITAH? I feel like he doesn\\u2019t give a rats ass about me and is being disrespectful, he says it\\u2019s the \\u2018pregnancy hormones\\u2019 making me whiny.\\n\\nETA: thank you all for your judgement and messages. I\\u2019m going to have a conversation w my bf tonight. To those who think he wanted to keep it: he made it clear (explicitly) that he didn\\u2019t want it. Regardless, I want to at least understand his motivations. I will try to post an update when this is all over. Thank you again.\\nAlso don\\u2019t waste your time calling me a baby killer, I\\u2019m 100% pro choice and would do it again in a heartbeat. If you can\\u2019t understand why, then you\\u2019re not someone I want to engage with anyway.\",\n          \"So I\\u2019m a 21 year old female. I feel like I should say these thing about myself because these are usually what people ask or say when they find out I rarely shave my legs. I\\u2019m straight, I\\u2019m very feminine, and I just don\\u2019t like to waste my time or money on shaving my legs. Also I\\u2019m not a hairy person at all! You can barley see my leg hair, arm hair or even my god damn eyebrows. The only time I shave is when I\\u2019m dating a new guy in my life and I\\u2019ve been with my current BF for 3 years now. Also he doesn\\u2019t give a rats ass if I shave my legs. \\n\\nSo I work for a promotion company where I travel and work at event and festivals. But today I had to go into the office to grab some materials and my boss was there in his office so I stoped to say hi before I left out. \\n\\nWhen I ducked in he awkwardly asked me if we could talk about something. I said sure and came in and he shut the door. He was so red and stuttering but finally he told me we needed to speak about hygiene. I was in literal shock. I was so embarrassed and asked him what he meant. My boss then proceeded to tell me that a few people complained I didn\\u2019t shave my legs and they said it went against company policy that I wasn\\u2019t being hygienic. I was even more shocked. \\n\\nI told him I didn\\u2019t understand what that had to do with me shaving my legs and he was just absolutely quiet. I asked him if he shaved his legs and he still said nothing. I then stood up and said if we were gonna keep talking about this I\\u2019d prefer HR to be there and he just told me that we didn\\u2019t need to discuss it any further. \\n\\nLater today I just got an email from HR saying that they would like to set up a meeting for next week to talk further about the discussion that happened today. I\\u2019m freaking out and it\\u2019s making me so anxious.\\nAITA for not shaving my legs for my job?\\n\\nEDIT: So people giving my boss hate i understand but I\\u2019m not mad at him and don\\u2019t blame him. Im not sure but I feel like someone was in fact pressuring him to talk to me about this because he is a usually very chill and a nice guy who usually doesn\\u2019t even force dress code and stuff. But also I really have no clue what really brought this on all of a sudden since I\\u2019ve worked there 8 months with no incident.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pagerank\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5999,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Obviously, they cannot have the wedding as planned, but they still would like to get married, so they decided on a \\u201cZoom\\u201d wedding where all of the family/friends would just call in to watch the officiant, my sister, and her fianc\\u00e9.
